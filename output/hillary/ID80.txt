When us people faith — I one — feel pain insults, misunderstanding, denigration cherish, must expect others resort violence. That universal standard expectation, everyone's obligation meet that, make differences, expect less expect others. You cannot respond offensive speech violence without begetting violence. And I strongly believe great religions world stronger insults. They withstood offense centuries. Refraining violence, then, sign weakness one's faith; absolutely opposite, sign one's faith unshakable. So tonight, must come together recommit working toward future marked understanding acceptance rather distrust, hatred, fear. We pledge whenever one person speaks ignorance bigotry, ten voices answer. They answer resoundingly offense insult, answering ignorance enlightenment, answering hatred understanding, answering darkness light; one person commits violent act name religion, millions stand condemn strength. In times like these, easy despair differences irreconcilable, mountains steep climb; therefore never reach level understanding peacefulness seek, I believe great religions world call us pursue. But that's I believe, I don't think it's believe either tonight. Part makes country special keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing future. We keep supporting next generation, believing young people keep us moving forward positive direction. So tonight I think it's important talk better tomorrow seek, also things — real, practical, tangible things — young people help shape better future. Two years ago room, Eid reception, launched program called Generation Change lead grassroots agenda positive engagement Muslim communities. And I asked young Muslim leaders audience night unofficial ambassadors, help build personal connections, seek partners countries. And I report tonight disappoint.

We building international alliance young people want drive change communities. They act mentors, spark respectful debates, simply offer words encouragement needed. But importantly, inspire others keep expanding circle mutual understanding respect, one person time.

The Republicans seem "winning" political terms, largely Americans think tanks media realize virtually intelligence security post-mortems events uncover problems.

Moreover, competent security officers always asking support coverage area risks exist. There never enough security even best funded times, best funded times.

The House cut security funding $128 million FY2011 $331 million FY2012, although Senate restored $88 million. Under least one Congressman Ryan's proposals amend budget, State Department funding would cut additional 20% million 2014 – means another $400 million cut security.

Indeed, time far many countries crisis U.S. faces increased challenges regional goals, funds, stronger country teams, increased humanitarian aid, beefed-up military assistance, on-the-scene diplomacy needed support U.S. interests. In fairness Secretary Clinton large number dedicated diplomatic professionals, State tried deal challenges refocusing diminishing resources, strengthening ability provide on-the- scene aid, creating civil efforts deal crises like Syria need provide stronger U.S. aid advisory teams dictators like Assad fall.

Indeed, time far many countries crisis U.S. faces increased challenges regional goals, funds, stronger country teams, increased humanitarian aid, beefed-up military assistance, on-the-scene diplomacy needed support U.S. interests.

The Republicans seem "winning" political terms, largely Americans think tanks media realize virtually intelligence security post-mortems events uncover problems. Once event clear patterns emerge, always warning indicators could heeded retrospect. If one ignores vast amount "noise" conflicting indicators, looks back 20-20 hindsight, every event always "intelligence" failure. Moreover, competent security officers always asking support coverage area risks exist. There never enough security even best funded times, best funded times. Almost every aspect U.S. diplomacy subject budget cuts time upheaval Arab world global economic crisis. A recent article Dana Milbank Washington Post notes Republican dominated House critiques events Libya cut State Department operations $300 million 2009 eliminated funds 30 security positions along it. The House cut security funding $128 million FY2011 $331 million FY2012, although Senate restored $88 million. Under least one Congressman Ryan's proposals amend budget, State Department funding would cut additional 20% million 2014 – means another $400 million cut security. It tribute Obama Administration far little push back cuts, even less articulate need fund stronger U.S. "expeditionary diplomacy" efforts. Indeed, time far many countries crisis U.S. faces increased challenges regional goals, funds, stronger country teams, increased humanitarian aid, beefed-up military assistance, on-the-scene diplomacy needed support U.S. interests. In fairness Secretary Clinton large number dedicated diplomatic professionals, State tried deal challenges refocusing diminishing resources, strengthening ability provide on-the- scene aid, creating civil efforts deal crises like Syria need provide stronger U.S. aid advisory teams dictators like Assad fall.

Some ambassadors, aid team personnel experts public diplomacy, CIA men women uniform. Every one tragedy. But cannot let either false economies extremist terrorist threats defeat efforts.

Don't set impossible goals instant democracy, human rights, rule law stability. Accept need evolutionary action "doing way." Don't try one size fits ideological solutions efforts Washington. • Stop focusing narrow budget cuts examine costs benefits effective, well-funded country team efforts. If properly funded diplomacy country team efforts win support U.S. one crisis country next decade, avoid even one armed intervention, still pay costs terms U.S. budget, overall effort immensely valuable terms gains (and tax revenues) U.S. trade investment. • Reexamine create elements "expeditionary diplomacy" efforts, including strong country teams, ability suddenly boost teams countries crises, full range tools ambassador needs. This includes adequate staff, operating security funds, flexible aid funds applied quickly deal changing needs circumstances. • Fully fund security find best ways change existing procedures emphasize mobility move high-risk areas.

The Settlements Facts By Daniel Kurtzer Sunday, June 14, 2009 Faulty analysis Israeli settlement issue passed fact. Charles Krauthammer's June 5 column, "The Settlements Myth <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/04/AR2009060403811.html> ," one example. Here facts: In 2003, Israeli government accepted, reservations, "road map" peace, imposed two requirements Israel regarding settlements: "GOI [Government Israel] immediately dismantles settlement outposts erected since March 2001. Consistent Mitchell Report, GOI freezes settlement activity (including natural growth settlements)." Today, Israel maintains three events -- namely, draft understandings discussed 2003 Prime Minister Ariel Sharon U.S. deputy national security adviser Stephen Hadley; President George W. Bush's April 14, 2004, letter Sharon; April 14 letter Sharon adviser Dov Weissglas national security adviser Condoleezza Rice -- constitute formal understanding United States accepted continuing Israeli building within "construction line" settlements. The problem understanding. The first event Israelis cite 2003 discussions four-part draft included notion construction within settlements might permitted confined already built-up areas settlements. The idea draw line around outer perimeter built-up areas settlements allow building inside line. This draft never codified, effort made define line around built-up areas settlements. B6 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758778 Date: 06/30/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758778 Date: 06/30/2015 Nonetheless, Israel began act largely accordance reading provisions, probably believing U.S. silence conferred assent. Second, President Bush's 2004 letter conveyed U.S. support agreed outcome negotiations Israel would retain "existing major Israeli population centers" West Bank "on basis mutually agreed changes ...." One key provisions letter U.S. support Israel's retaining settlements predicated "agreed outcome" negotiations. Despite Israel's contention letter allowed continue building large settlement blocs Ariel, Maale Adumim Gush Etzion, letter convey U.S. support understanding Israeli settlement activities areas run-up peace agreement. In 2004 letter Rice, Weissglas addressed issue "construction line," saying "within agreed principles settlement activities, effort made next days better definition construction line settlements Judea & Samaria." However, never "agreed principles settlement activities." Moreover, effort define "construction line" never consummated: Israel United States discussed briefly reach agreement definition construction line settlements. Weissglas's letter also promised "continuous action" remove unauthorized outposts, Israel removed almost none them. Throughout period, Bush administration regularly protest Israel's continuing settlement activity. But different arguing United States agreed it. In recent days, former senior Bush administration officials told journalists background understandings existed Israel regarding continued settlement activity. Commentators also focus Obama administration's reiteration freeze must include "natural growth" settlements. Krauthammer says "means strangling death thriving towns close 1949 armistice line. .. It means increase population. Which means babies." This nonsense. No one suggests Israelis stop babies. Rather, blessing new baby translate right build apartments houses settlements. The two issues nothing other. Israelis, like Americans, move time life circumstances -- children, jobs, housing availability -- change. The pattern population growth territories actually undercuts natural-growth argument. Since 1993, Israel signed Oslo Accords, Israel's West Bank settler population grown 116,300 289,600. The numbers East Jerusalem increased 152,800 186,000. This goes far beyond natural increase families already living settlements. Inserting provision "natural growth" official documents started 2001 Mitchell Report 2003 "road map," reflecting recognition concept abused justification expanding settlements. The Obama administration pursuing policies every administration since 1967 articulated -- settlements jeopardize possibility achieving peace thus settlement activity stop. This diminish Palestinians' responsibilities, especially commitment stop violence terrorism uproot terrorist infrastructure. President Obama emphasized Cairo speech. But Palestinian failures way justify Israeli failure implement road map commitments respect settlements outposts. It time Israel freeze settlement activity dismantle unauthorized outposts.

I hopeful something worked out. In meantime, I wanted take offer provide thoughts China prior upcoming SED July 27-28. I send note Beijing (midway four-day visit) via Blackberry -- apologies typos. 1. Mounting signs social instability intensified China's growth imperatives. Beijing insiders concerned Xinjiang uprising; Hu Jintao's pre-G-8 exit validates concerns. Coming heels last year's problems Tibet, social instability longer dismissed isolated occurrence. In cases, sources claim growth shortfalls exacerbated ethnic disturbances. China's recent fiscal stimulus -- especially infrastructure initiatives West -- attempts address this. Growth long modern China's antidote risks social instability. 2. A massive external demand shock dilutes growth antidote China needs contain social instability. In fact, global recession adds new risk factor China's social instability equation. The government confirmed reports 20 million layoffs migrant workers export-intensive Guangdong Province -- direct outgrowth collapse Chinese exports past year (from growth +25% mid-2008 contraction -25% May 2009). Driven record capitulation American consumer -- real US consumption -1.8% past four quarters (a 58-year record plunge) -- China's biggest source end-market export demand hit extraordinary shock. To extent come count -- remains best guess, although less dramatic US consumption adjustment saw past year -- external demand pressures continue undermine China's growth imperatives feed heightened concerns social instability. 3. China's stimulus package "quick fix" exacerbate already worrisome structural imbalances. The focus stimulus two unbalanced sectors -- fixed investment exports, collectively account 80% Chinese GDP. Fully 72% RMB4 trillion fiscal initiative announced last November goes infrastructure. And aggressive incentives directed exporters (i.e., tax rebates, "buy China" procurement incentives, SME credit support, etc.). Moreover, huge push State-directed bank lending -- full- year 2009 lending target hit mid-April! This latter initiative underscores risks deteriorating loan quality associated banking problems road. Meanwhile, despite public claims contrary, little done stimulate one sector China needs -- internal private consumption. Social safety net efforts still puny -- recent healthcare plan translates US$30 per person three years National Social Security Fund enough assets provide $90 lifetime social security benefits per worker! This forces fear-driven -- precautionary -- saving that, turn, inhibits consumer-led impetus Chinese rebalancing urgently needs.

At time, China unfortunately upping ante two unbalanced sectors -- investment exports. Sadly, could set still unbalanced global economy another serious accident not-so-distant future.

On June 14, less month meeting President Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave one comprehensive, thoughtful highly personal speeches supporting Israeli-Palestinian peace process Israeli prime minister recent years, perhaps ever. One would thought speech would big news U.S., Europe elsewhere. Mr. Netanyahu first time clearly stated would support two-state solution, albeit understandable requirements guarantee Israel's security, despite leaving different impression last month's U.S. visit. Yet, reaction governments media U.S. Europe functional equivalent tree falling forest one listening. Where covered, writing emphasized cynical focused half-empty, rather half-full, glass. So let's take closer look could turn significant, game-changing speech. It divided, essentially, four parts: personal, historic, diplomatic economic. The personal aspect speech deals issue peace. At one point, Mr. Netanyahu spoke directly Palestinian people: "We want live peace, good neighbors. We want children children never experience war: parents, brothers sisters never know agony losing loved ones battle; children able dream better future realize dream; together invest energies plowshares pruning hooks, swords spears." And reminded Palestinians family, peace war quite personal: "I know face war. 1 experienced battle. I lost close friends. I lost brother. I seen pain bereaved families. I want war. No one Israel wants war." Mr. Netanyahu also spent time speech history, relitigate ancient argument lived Palestine first longest time. Rather, Mr. Netanyahu explained "root conflict" based fundamental misstatement undeniable historical facts. Palestinians taught Israel founded largely alien foreigners, foisted native Palestinians Europeans feeling guilty Holocaust. That misstatement central rationale Arab Palestinian unwillingness publicly recognize Israel Jewish state. In fact, points out, "the attacks us began 1920s," 20 years Holocaust. And undeniable historical fact "the Jewish people land Israel go back 3,500 years" - Abraham, Isaac Jacob, forefathers Jews; David Solomon, ancient Israel's two greatest kings; Isaiah Jeremiah, two UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759019 Date: 06/30/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759019 Date: 06/30/2015 Jewish religion's greatest spiritual prophets, lived Judea Samaria, today called West Bank. "The right Jewish people state land Israel derive cascade catastrophes befell people," prime minister said. "There say Holocaust occurred, state Israel would never established. But I say state Israel would established earlier, Holocaust would occurred." Third, prime minister addressed two simple requirements peace Israel Palestinians: recognition security. As first, put quite simply: "A fundamental prerequisite ending conflict public, binding unequivocal Palestinian recognition Israel nation-state Jewish people." As security, also quite simple: Palestine must demilitarized, guaranteed international community, open skies, military alliances hostile powers, "effective security measures prevent weapons smuggling territory - real monitoring, occurs Gaza today." Once two issues recognition security Israel guaranteed, rest difficult issues seem come much easier: new settlements, wiggle room natural growth current settlements caused families growing; equitable treatment assistance placing refugees land homes outside Israel (to preserve essence historic Israel Jewish state). And always controversial issue Jerusalem, Mr. Netanyahu deftly ambiguous: "Jerusalem, capital Israel, must remain undivided, continued religious freedom faiths." That seem exclude Palestinian de facto control certain parts Jerusalem certainly holy places. Finally, prime minister expressed clear concrete vision economic prosperity Palestinians partnership Israel. Indeed, stated economic prosperity come even final peace agreement reached. "An economic peace substitute political peace important element achieving it. Together undertake projects overcome scarcities region, like water desalination, maximize advantages, like developing solar energy, exploiting geographic location laying gas petroleum lines establishing transportation links Asia, Africa Europe....

Who cannot moved words? Perhaps Mr. Netanyahu right - new sequencing peace process: First, economic partnership prosperity Israelis Palestinians; peace, way around. It could accident Mr. Netanyahu chose deliver remarkable speech Begin-Sadat Center Bar-Ilan University. It slightly 30 years ago, March 26, 1979, Prime Minister Menachem Begin, leader right-wing Likud "Consolidation" Party, joined Egyptian President Anwar Sadat signed historic peace agreement Israel Egypt. Now another man right, another Likud prime minister three decades later, seems poised make lasting peace Israel Palestinians long eluded predecessors. One wonders whether Mr. Netanyahu might also thinking: If Richard Nixon could go China base right trusted him, I bring peace prosperity Israelis Palestinians. Let's hope - pray - right. Lanny J.

The Obama administration's new strategy, focusing securing Afghan population's safety partnering Afghan security forces effort, important start reversing situation Afghanistan.

These steps include increasing size Afghan Army police much faster presently planned; providing trainers Afghan Army police presently planned; providing equipment presently planned; working separate local Taliban fighters leaders attract side government Iraq. While security situation Afghanistan worsened, still important advantages there. The Afghan people hate Taliban. Public opinion polls show support Taliban 5%. In addition, Afghan army highly motivated troops proven fighters. Despite advantages, face significant challenges. General McChrystal believes, I agree, need regain initiative create momentum towards success. General McChrystal worries, rightly so, perception lost initiative, impact perception Afghan people, government, al Qaeda Taliban. By contrast, dispel perception, chance convince local lower- level Taliban fighters lay arms rejoin Afghan society. I believe effective way retake initiative Afghanistan series steps ensure Afghanistan's army police manpower, equipment support secure nation. First, increase troop levels Afghan army police faster currently planned. There approximately 90,000 troops Afghan army now, number scheduled go 134,000 October 2010. The Afghan police scheduled reach level 82,000 time. For long time, many us urged establishment goal 240,000 Afghan troops 160,000 Afghan police 2013. The Afghan Minister Defense strongly supported numbers. It appears government Afghan government prepared accept goals. But need additional Afghan forces urgent. I believe possible essential advance goals year, 2012. Our military Afghariistan repeatedly pointed need Afghan forces. In one sector Helmand province visited last week, Marines outnumbered Afghan soldiers 5 one. A Marine Company commander Helmand province told New York Times July lack Afghan troops "is absolutely Achilles heel." What need increase size Afghan army police? According Afghan Defense Minister Wardak, lack Afghan manpower; we've assured available. But need significantly trainers. We asked General Formica, charge American effort train Afghan security forces, whether increase possible. He indicated would make assessment would necessary order meet earlier timetable. In meantime, also press NATO allies much greater forcefulness provide trainers. If NATO allies going come combat forces pledged, least could provide additional trainers. Larger Afghan security forces also require mid-level Afghan officers.

A significant part could transferred Afghan forces, increasing capability without weakening readiness. And yet seem kind crash effort place that. We need obtain urgent basis list basic equipment needs Afghan forces list needs could met major program transfer equipment leaving Iraq. Rapidly expanding Afghanistan's military police forces would address one major problems risks face there. General McChrystal told us worries waiting 2013 larger Afghan force creates gap capabilities brings significant risk failure. But accelerating training equipping Afghan forces year, address concern. Depending additional capability Afghan, rather U.S., forces, also addresses major problem public perception Afghanistan. The larger military footprint there, enemies seek drive wedge us Afghan population, spreading falsehood seek dominate Muslim nation. Finally, make concerted effort separate local Taliban leaders. In Iraq, large numbers young Iraqis attacking us switched side became.the "Sons Iraq." They drawn part promise jobs amnesty past attacks, part recognition status quo creating horrific violence communities. In interests interests nation, switched sides became positive force. That prospect exists Afghanistan. Afghan leaders military say local Taliban fighters motivated largely need job loyalty local leader pays ideology religious zeal.

General McChrystal emphasized potential re-integration accomplish result achieved Iraq. Here General McChrystal said July 28th: "Most fighters see Afghanistan Afghans, foreign cadre them. But don't see deeply ideological even politically motivated; operating pay; commander's charismatic leadership; frustrated local leaders. So I believe significant potential go I would call mid- low-level Taliban fighters leaders offer re-integration Afghanistan constitution." But "game changing" possibility apparently factored General McChrystal's assessment. There plan yet put place Sons Iraq approach Afghanistan. It urgent lay steps need taken involve local national Afghan leaders effort. They alone accomplish crucial job, first Afghan allies must draft plan urgent basis. And potential positive impact plan taken account consider need additional U.S. military resources. Afghanistan's people grateful aid, also eager assume responsibility future. In tiny village Helmand Province, invited meet village elders council meeting, shura. One hundred men sat floor chatted us future country's future. When asked long United States stay, one elder said: "Until moment make security forces self-sufficient. Then welcome visit us, soldiers guests." Helping Afghanistan achieve self-sufficiency security everybody's goal. On little difference opinion, Afghanistan's village councils corridors Capitol. Can help Afghanistan reach self-sufficiency security fast enough? Can get way regains initiative creates momentum need?

AM Smart-Sourcing Diplomacy Development While Americans know it, business foreign policy increasingly private hands. In 2000, State Department spent $1.3 billion contracts $102.5 million grants. By 2008, grant spending grown $2.5 billion contract spending grown $5.6 billion. In 2000, USAID spent $0 grants[1] $478.6 million contracts. By 2008, figures climbed $5.2 billion $3.2 billion, respectively (source: USAspending.gov[2]).

The privatization trend predates Bush Administration part appropriate response globalization's possibilities generally changing nature American power. But last eight years, laissez-faire outsourcing execute two ambitious wars carried day, oversight management often outsourced well implementation. Today, State Department especially USAID dependent contractors, outsourcing, turn, remade work environment federal employees. Negative consequences private sector granted power without responsibility, diminished overtaxed DSS, demoralized USAID, looming catastrophe Iraq Afghanistan, reconstruction money first flowed everyone's pockets except ordinary citizens. What done? Smart-sourcing, in-sourcing To align practices interests, centrality outsourcing contemporary business government must properly acknowledged. America's allies today include range non-governmental actors, for-profit non- profit, recipients taxpayer dollars. While policy something government devised (the "what") contractors executed (the "how"), longer case information age. Especially development realm, success failure today turns US strategy, effectively places web non-governmental personnel key policy-making positions. Since development democracy demand engagement employment local populations, turning clock back bringing whatever possible back house would therefore cure worse disease. We don't need new prescription glasses; need new eye chart. A smart-sourcing approach defines "how" policy strategic issue proceeds two fronts simultaneously. First, smart-sourcing means building capacity managing OMB's July guidelines contracting call multi- sector workforce. State Department contracting, programming, information technology functions must redefined collaborative ventures, State might effectively orchestrate mission-oriented networks across public-private divide. Second, smart-sourcing involves identifying tasks never outsourced bringing back in-house. It may easiest in-source according political expediency, temptation must avoided. Clear guidelines limits outsourcing must delineated strategic rather ad hoc choices made. Both reforms virtue directly advancing objectives outlined OMB Director Peter Orszag's July memoranda. More specifically, State Department committed smart-sourcing should: Support promote OMB efforts improve contracts grants data quality, well development USA spending.gov include subcontracts subgrants. Transparency accountability critical values smart-sourcing orientation, anti-corruption efforts abroad enhanced credibility perceived upholding values home.

If organizations like Clinton Global Initiative Gates Foundation advance American interests effectively traditional direct government intervention, overseas direct investment may dated policy instrument. Follow money identify DOD reconstruction contracts rightfully belonged State's domain bolster already compelling argument greater civilian resources. There smart power without smart-sourcing. Bottom line: The information revolution rendered big government vs. small government debates beside point.

Furthermore, WIC's words interlaced Branch's recollection dictations, number direct WJC quotes far fewer I expected. HRC much player one might imagine. Her role largely seen interactions Branch recording WJC. Her statements consistent past, exception Gephardt comment, didn't grab much attention all.[1] (Others included HRC's devotion CVC, thought special prosecutor images returning meetings. They pretty much aligned interactions Branch.) Surprisingly, surprisingly, many problems discussed book those, face current Administration—Middle East peace, North Korea, China, etc... UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015 Branch repeatedly injects feelings specific subjects seems use book voice opinion Administration events time. He clearly topics prefers others (for example connection events Haiti result lot discussion it), subjects strikingly sparsely discussed Rwanda. Its absence long discussions surprising, appear thought WJC ever-dodged questions topic, weren't addressed. Much like My Life, one theme repeated WJC's conflict disdain media, especially long passages NYT Washington Post. There instances gives credit reporting, would hard-pressed find them. Additionally, numerous mentions WJC's acute allergies chronic fatigue, imagery falling asleep sessions couple occasions. The book quite bit Whitewater, given dearth public documentation little Branch could write hadn't said. One thing I recalled D'Amato's subpoena CVC's friends, later quashed, slept NBC's Rose Law Firm records White House. Branch portray helpful distinction WJC looked Whitewater scandals. While WJC attacks Whitewater political hunt, Branch WJC saying Filegate needed separated Whitewater, legitimate inquiry. There quips could catch someone's eye, WJC referring Paula Jones "a 'new bimbo' [WJC] didn't even recognize." Branch dwell Lewinsky impeachment. With exception Bruce, Bennett Kendall, lawyers mentioned. There one passage I looking into, WJC says part reason didn't mention relationship Lewinsky first threatened jail time found lying oath told truth could become witness her. This small passage could easily missed, one important note I don't recall hearing before. (This addressed fully below.) There relationships track book others. They include WJC's relationship Gore, maps part focal point end, contentious relationship Janet Reno. The one Senator appears discussed negatively Moynihan. All three issues discussed turn below. WJC portrayed extremely loving attentive father HRC portrayed much human light books/articles covering time period, ample mention relationship CVC images affection WJC, pre- post-impeachment. On foreign relations lot time spent discussing Middle East, Northern Ireland, Balkans, China, Russia, Pakistan/India beginning book, Haiti. (Note: Much written Haiti Branch's experience subject.) There also fair amount discussion North Korea, nothing discussed past weeks. Bin Laden discussed seems track mention My Life, seems detail background book. In certain cases detail My Life, example trip Pakistan WJC wrote USSS cancelled one stop would "defenseless" flying in, whereas Brach writes streets would lined UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015 "assassins." There candid looks WIC's take certain people relationship some, Albright Berger's dislike Holbrooke, detailed depiction Yeltsin's drinking, yelling outside Blair House cab get pizza. One thing note, often times WJC seems speaking Branch intentionally without recorders going, Branch writes interactions exchanges nonetheless. Such case HRC's Gephardt comment. The following items addressed memo: Wen Ho Lee Terror Clause Crime Bill 4 WJC Lewinsky's Silence 4 HRC Kissinger 4 HRC gay/lesbian 5 Tension Moynihan 5 HRC World Player 5 Jesse Jackson 6 Tension Janet Reno 6 Portrayal Carter Relationship Gore 8 Other (This includes: Maggie recommending Panetta, HRC Haiti Invasion, ITAV co-author flap, Subpoenas CVC's Friends, Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex, Gore/HRC ticket, WJC suggesting Rubin run Senate, Trip South Asia) 11 Wen Ho Lee Terror Clause Crime Bill In discussing Wen Ho Lee's release Branch characterizes WJC's lack knowledge strained interpretation anti-terrorist provisions crime bill arbitrary detentions "confession." My Life mentions Lee's accusation passing discuss Lee. Below two passages Branch's book first giving context second Terror Clause Crime Bill. UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015 0 The year closed spies terrorism. The Justice Department, fierce debate among security agencies, indicted nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee fifty-nine counts copying classified material personal computer. Lee handled like radioactive espionage defendant—no bail, lockdown, solitary confinement—even though long dragnet produced evidence offered secrets China anyone else. The president said experts telling worst spies sometimes stored treason rainy day. This sounded fishy me. Clinton shrugged. Nothing would please establish Lee's innocence. [Branch, 577] 0 While Lee indicted, Branch writes WJC noted others "were held secret, uncharged untried...He [WIC] embarrassed sponsored measure law without foreseeing arbitrary detentions...Under terrorist act, prosecutor decide within legal limit...whether bring charges testimony secret informant otherwise. To dismay, Clinton learned defendants held incommunicado six months. One extreme detention last three years. 'I think it's wrong,' [WJC] said. 'It's American. We accept guilty people street enjoy protect freedom." [Branch, 629] WJC Lewinsky's Silence Branch writes part WJC's motive discussing happened Lewinsky could send jail, denied it. 0 "Also, pointed Starr threatening jail Lewinsky year sworn denial affair. If Clinton come forward anything relationship, said Starr could turned witness Lewinsky, betraying discreet silence. Such subtleties, original, struck tendentious. The president never claimed chivalry real motive steadfast denial, dispute essential truth Lewinsky's account." [Branch, 511] HRC Kissinger The following could fodder people want continue string along notion channeling Eleanor Roosevelt. 0 There passage HRC describes exchange Kissinger dinner complained health care bill passed wouldn't able see doctor. She continued say "it interesting, fact, dreamed Kissinger nights before. His visage turned suddenly effervescent banquet, announcing gladly worries Clinton health care bill dying. 'Oh, no, Dr. Kissinger,' replied coolly. 'Don't sure it's dead. We'll keep fighting, there's always light end tunnel.' She said Kissing blanched, speechless deft reminder Vietnam War...Now last, Hillary's dream, registered strategic designs spewed carnage venom seven needless years...'That's I dreamed,' Hillary repeated, lost thought. 'You know, I always get revenge dreams, never real life."

WJC left room. "He subdued return. 'You know, I've lot contact gay people life Hillary.' He sighed. Her temperament conservative, religious core, formed homosexual issues even mentionable. New York politics tough crucible, unsure heat could take. On hand, personal experience could speed adaptation." [Branch, 551] Tension Moynihan There several occasions throughout book Branch recalls WJC's grievances frustration Moynihan. For example: 0 When Moynihan called international arms embargo unilaterally lifted Bosnia could fight themselves, Branch writes, "The president flinched I mentioned [it]...'That's freebie him,' snapped Clinton, 'and knows it." [p.140] 0 In regard health care: "Echoing comments Hillary dinner, [WIC] faulted Senator Moynihan aimless hearings conducted without strategy theme." [p.170] 0 Discussing Independent Counsel: "She [HRC] especially scornful Democrats, quoted number them. Senator Moynihan, instance, publicly said Clintons nice people sure nothing hide. 'Why investigation?' often asked. She said Moynihan skated blithely surface, never produced results Congress, could withstand scrutiny five minutes, living apartment secured chairmanship Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation." [Brach, 182] 0 "Donnybrook" argument Moynihan said fundraising speech WJC gave citing regretted hypothetical controversial decision. Moynihan told press, "He doesn't understand...that he's conceding principles." WJC confronted lack context given statement press said Moynihan knew "feeding beast hostile presumption Clinton's motives." [Branch, 299] HRC World Player There several images HRC player world stage, WJC own. Several examples follow: UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015 0 Middle East: Discussing peace King Hussein: "They retreated lunch two couples—the Clintons, king wife, Queen Noor—in family dining room...Their agenda delicate race Hussein's failing health desire make peace Israel. The president said Hillary pounded away symptoms national estrangement: closed boarders, water disputes, travel barriers, war grievances, contested airspace, sealed electrical grids, on. Hussein gave feast goodwill without commitment point." [Branch, 170] 0 South Asia: Regarding trip South Asia CVC 1995, "Her [HRC's] schedule far demanding ceremonial, pushing conflict resolution civic empowerment downtrodden women." [Branch, 236] Later Branch tells Benazir Bhutto praising CVC HRC. "By contrast superficial American press, portrayed Hillary demure tourist policy significance exotic Asia, Bhutto said touched essential political chords whirlwind encouragements citizenship groups small-scale economic development." (The note contrasting Bhutto corresponds NYT article Branch quotes footer saying, "she [HRC] played traditional role First Lady wife mother...") [Branch, 246] 0 China Speech: Branch outlines HRC felt speech needed bigger China depicted "harsh reality everywhere" China Africa. He cites WJC commenting rave reviews HRC's speech. [Branch, 289] 0 Regarding Russian financial system meltdown, Branch writes "Yeltsin seemed removed urgent political tasks Clintons counseled directly." [Branch, 512-513] Jesse Jackson Branch writes Jesse Jackson calling CVC Lewinsky story broke continued contact throughout period. WJC thanks support CVC. This goes detail WJCs gratitude, fact Jackson "counseled" CVC public knowledge dating back least 1999. 0 "But Jesse done something would forget. When Lewinsky news broke, called Chelsea Stanford. Jesse nonfamily adult cell phone number. How got another story. Jesse said knew terrible her. Nothing like ever happened American politics. He know everything involved, wanted remind Chelsea much parents loved her. Their family needed stick together all, needed counsel, rage, pray, always available."

If removed her, however, pending decision yet another special prosecutor [for 1996 campaign finance] would fall Reno's deputy, Jamie Gorelick, who, Clinton feared, may share Reno's wholesale devotion outside control case president may become target...lf removed Reno Gorelick, start fresh, would touch firestorm protest like Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre Justice Department officials Watergate scandal. That option." [Branch, 388-389] 0 Branch writes WJC talking Reno Louis Freeh disregarding letter D'Amato continuing allow independent counsel go Ciseneros. The held true Mike Espy. Branch outlines meeting WJC Reno. Reno made public statements "desire stay job. 'I told I didn't like one damn bit,' president said tersely. 'I didn't hire work New York Times Washington Post. I hired work me." [Branch, 398] He continues outline Clinton give Reno credit good achievements including coordination U.S. attorneys didn't blame special prosecutor Whitewater, "he blame abdicating responsibility supervise investigations ever since, letting mandates multiply almost will. She accepted criteria ludicrous crassly partisan. Reno failed defend presidency itself—not Clinton personally, institution—and extension entire executive branch...He told clue meant. His advisers considered naïve upright, fuzziness distinction seemed save her." [Branch, 399] He cites Clinton warned prepare staying job entire second term. Portrayal Jimmy Carter There parallels could drawn WJC/BHO Carter/WJC terms Carter's trip North Korea mission went Haiti. WJC clearly frustrated Carter's seeming desire front lines. North Korea: 0 "On North Korea, [WJC] said Jimmy Carter initiated recent trip call Al Gore, Clinton approved volunteer mission break North Korea's extreme isolation...Sure enough, Carter reach North Korean dictator Kim II-sung, proposed allow inspection North Korea's nuclear facilities exchange relief harsh economic sanctions. The hitch Carter announced terms CNN became official, adding gratuitously never agreed sanctions first place. News stories White House seething, Clinton made light spat. He said deal since ratified exchange letters, believe Carter would criticize official policy 'if game still doubt."

He didn't want leave WJC told to. Like North Korea, Carter again, Carter went press first. "The three negotiators flew back Washington late Sunday, Carter, invited stay White House, called CNN's Judy Woodruff midnight arrange interview next morning reported Clinton mission. This conduct, president said tersely, right...The press full retrospective stories friction three prominent negotiators... He said current newsweeklies lapped criticism Carter embarrassment Clinton...Many advisers griped Jimmy Carter thought still president, Clinton found criticism jaundiced. Carter spoken restraint joint press conference, allowed, exhibiting keen political ear...To Clinton, Carter simply felt earned right speak mind international statesman, even mission accepted United States government complete Air Force jet. This sense entitlement could make Carter thorn, Clinton thought value far outweighed political annoyance. He considered Carter sterling ex-resident." [Branch, 200-201] Dispatch Bombers Near Iraq 0 "He expected military strikes win bipartisan assent, including former presidents Ford, Reagan Bush. 'Dole support me,' said. 'Carter probably criticize me. Carter always criticizes, doesn't much positive say." [Branch, 518] Gore For majority book, little discussion WJC Gore's relationship. There places briefly mentioned couple scenes levity. The end, however, describes seemingly brutally candid conversation two 2000 election impeachment. 0 On page 92 Branch writes, "No, [Clinton] ask Gore take failed foreign policy, alleged, improve public presentations troika 'bad talkers': shy National Security Adviser Tony Lake, boring Secretary State Warren Christopher, disorganized Defense Secretary Les Aspin." [Branch, 92] 0 In one-passage WJC talks asking Gore lead independent review Hazel O'Leary also Gore substitute economic conference Japan. The latter fare well nations offended Gore, WJC attended. Gore insisted WJC needed go Japan redeem administration absence. Gore pointed days January, WJC "pronounced vital Chelsea's schoolwork. Gore blinked. So what?...Mutual exasperation spiked. 'Al,' Clinton told him, 'I going Japan leave Chelsea take exams.' Gore erupted. He thought Clinton lost bearing. They big fight, said president, still wrangling dates Japan." Branch states fight wound around time WJC saw Lewinsky.

HRC already knew paying first one $30,000 per month. The conversation leak offer Jim Neal TN, former Watergate prosecutor defend Gore free. The exchange ethics offer leak press Gore. 0 On Gore's announcing campaign. "The president called twice congratulate Gore kickoff events— Geneva, hours later Paris. Clinton thought glitches technical...But Gore got big things right. His twofold message perfect: distinguish Clinton's personal flaws, tell voters exactly would White House. The president said fine Gore call Clinton's affair Monica Lewinsky 'inexcusable.' First, true. Second, showed necessary strength criticized boss. Third, Gore would badgered death did. 'Al,' Clinton told him, 'if thought would help campaign, I would let flog noon right doorstep Washington Post." [Branch, 553-554] Branch continues WJC told Gore ignore reporting offended critical campaign. "On tape, president said confided chief strategic worry Gore Gore's pollster, Mark Penn. The vice president must project platform—where stood, precisely would lead country—because Republicans would try knock substance." [Branch, 554] 0 WJC offered critiques Gore's campaign throughout, always framed fear Gore succeeding him. For example, "Clinton still thought Gore could win. Most people considered smart, experience, motivated. He examined pitfalls Gore campaign showcasing presidential character detailed agendas country. Reporters called Gore "stiff," Clinton discounted liability. He thought Gore's droll sense humor would wear well time. Gore also perceived conventional Democrat, therefore lacking independence, called Gore emphasize passion initiatives. Then president said Gore could brooding quality him, worrisome off-putting itself, potentially damaging serious nature failed give voters lifted. Clinton isolated word "sunny." Gore needed it." [Branch, 599] 0 He also complimented Gore's knowledge government workings. "Gore knew Washington. Believe me, said president, administration would made many errors first two years vice president." He goes say WJC suggested Gore find someone would bright spot run with, perhaps Durbin Bradley Kerrey, although also goes great detail virtues Mikulski, even though would never get chosen. How much WJC's emphasis versus Branch's focus home state senator unclear. [Branch, 599, 618-19] 0 WJC criticized Gore running successes administration. "They running essentially third term, said president, afraid Clinton-Gore record would tarnish Clinton's character." [Branch, 623] Branch gives WJC's critique Gore debate heard before—that Gore lacked style light touch. UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015 0 Branch WJC recalling conversation WJC Gore "Gore bared one stressful consultations insisting he, Gore, good politician, elaborating meant good policy, also good politics, admitted instinctively blend two. Gore said think it, Clinton thought pretty close bone...He stuff great president, message Clinton must convey somehow without seeming brag record." [Branch, 623-624] 0 The big passage Gore begins page 641 extends 645. Branch notes WJC unsure first recording details. At outset says, "For part, Gore angry, blame Clinton defeat, wanted acknowledge forthrightly people around did." [Branch, 642] It WJC acknowledging Gore's use proper—he best White House. Then says, "I think made mistake use last ten days," Clinton told Gore, 'but otherwise big deal. I much upset message, we're honest." [Branch, 642] Branch recalls WJC saying Gore fought bag saying "Clinton's drag plagued every direction." Clinton said Gore better governance Clinton, Gore would better nation Bush, "unparalleled" vice president, "blind spots." Branch writes WJC kept saying confrontation "surreal." o Gore "fresh grievance...he wanted Clinton know Buddhist temple fund-raising scandal worst experience life. No one ever questioned personal integrity, corrosive publicity whispers tormented four years. Gore said disposed blame Clinton. However, remembered telling president found English-speaking person one Asian fund-raisers. And president charge party apparatus supposed screen donations trouble. So blame Clinton way. The president told could scarcely believe ensuing tales suspicion. Gore must still shock election, unhinged. 'I thought Neverland,' said." [Branch, 643-644] o Branch continues: "The vice president asked Clinton Monica Lewinsky. He supported Clinton impeachment, publicly privately, declaring disappointed. Yes, said president. He appreciated that. However, persisted Gore, Clinton confide personal feelings. He never explained exactly happened. There little say, Clinton replied, beyond failure regret. He humiliated angry, made mistake. He misled American people, sorry. Gore closed point emphasis. Well, said, first time apologized personally. Clinton double take...Gore treated confession watershed.

Its attached pasted review. Thanks Dan A New Approach Missile Defense By Hillary Clinton Iran's development short- medium-range ballistic missiles poses clear growing threat security European allies forces stationed region. That President Obama announced yesterday United States ready deploy missile defenses Europe specifically geared toward stopping missiles. This threat cannot ignore. Previous missile defense efforts focused protecting intercontinental ballistic missiles capable reaching United States, intelligence shows threat long-range weapons progressed quickly feared. In contrast, evidence indicates Iran developing short- medium- range missiles eventually enable target Europe, Caucuses Middle East, including U.S. NATO forces. We deeply appreciate willingness Czech Polish Governments host original missile defense architecture soil, decision deploy systems better meet growing threat came result long careful review policies, capabilities, requirements. This decision alter unshakeable commitment United States security vital NATO allies. Rather, reflects determination jointly meet threats endanger us all. UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759705 Date: 06/30/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759705 Date: 06/30/2015 The old focus long-range missile defense systems left significant gaps ability defend shorter-range threats, exposing allies forces stationed Europe. Many experts also expressed concerns testing record effectiveness long-range interceptors deployed Poland. Our new approach different number ways. First, use well-tested missile defense systems, Standard Missile-3, current threats. And unlike old fixed, silo-based interceptors, mobile able shift threats evolve. Second, previous efforts sought by-pass NATO favor bilateral agreements, Obama Administration plans make coordination NATO central element approach. By working allies build workable cost-effective missile defense system Europe, better contribute protection NATO allies increase regional stability. For 60 years, NATO alliance force peace, prosperity security Europe around world commitment collective security: attack one ally attack all. An attack London Warsaw attack New York Washington. NATO demonstrated commitment September 11 terrorist attacks, first time, alliance invoked Article V NATO sent assets United States help protect us additional terrorist attacks. Unfortunately, old long-range defense plan created impression "two-tiers" security within alliance focusing theoretical threats could one day affect mainland United States, leaving European allies vulnerable real short- medium-range missiles. Our new plan corrects imbalance. We continue monitor counter longer-term threats, work allies protect NATO territory. We focus imminent threat, also developing capacity adjust quickly threat evolves. Finally, engage Russia part new approach. Russia also vulnerable Iran's short- medium- range missiles seek cooperate address common threat. I pleased Russians agreed Moscow Summit joint threat assessment ballistic missile challenges 21st century, including Iran. This positive first step I look forward future progress. In short, new missile defense plan realistic threats face, reliable tools use, inclusive allies pledged protect. While pursue new path, also redouble diplomatic efforts engage Iran focus leaders clear choice: whether join international community responsible member continue path isolation. But security allies forces cannot wait. That moving ahead new approach missile defense. 728 words UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759705 Date: 06/30/2015

While $70,000, request strange worrying. In 4 cases open file North South Kivu military prosecutors office exists. Only case Military Prosecutor General need involved, given B6 rank suspect. In 5 cases local military prosecutor opened legal investigation interviewed victims. The cases stopped political financial intervention. Now request indicates Military Prosecutor General needs fly country investigate. Not request 18 months late coming, makes sense. In 4 5 cases, military prosecutor Province jurisdiction. They need continue work. With suspects Kinshasa, makes work difficult. Is someone trying make money? Were given impression international community interested case, government not? Or little trust local prosecutors central government wants control? Or governmental officials know little criminal cases function inadvertently delaying procedures. Conclusion. Lobby effective remove position active command. Political intervention desired impact terms judicial action. To continued. Have good weekend.

The Central Europeans reacted decision apprehension alarm recognize replacement conceptually flawed plan credible one strengthens bonds transatlantic defence. The view Moscow clouded outright paranoia. Military experts suspected US rockets Poland, advertised defensive, could used offensively, even pre-emptively, Russia.

By limiting defensive capability superpowers, ABM treaty necessary companion piece series treaties setting ceilings offensive weaponry. Because nuclear weapons expected us forever, ABM treaty meant last perpetuity. While Soviets converted logic restricting defence, Ronald Reagan not. The late US president championed development space-based comprehensive shield would make offensive weapons — therefore mutual deterrence —"impotent obsolete." Many experts believed Reagan's vision, derisively nicknamed Star Wars, impossible dream. So successor, George H. W.

Two months on, considerable doubt whether Obama indeed take advice leave Europe lingering towards bottom pile. Nowhere danger striking UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760155 Date: 06/30/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760155 Date: 06/30/2015 Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC), body German Chancellor Angela Merkel persuaded President George Bush set April 2007 remove regulatory barriers transatlantic trade. STILL NO TEC CHAIR Obama widely praised moving quickly, comparison previous new presidents, nominate new administration. Yet spokesman told Europolitics still appointed future co-chair TEC. In interim, Michelle O'Neill, Deputy Undersecretary Department Commerce, tasked ensuring continuity. The EU Co-Chair Commission Vice-President Gunter Verheugen. Given dozens nominations already announced, may sign among long list priorities, TEC, significant EU-US initiative emerge recent years, feature highly. It noted Obama chair Senate Subcommittee Europe, 2007 2008, organise single hearing, something rival presidential campaign, Senator Hillary Clinton, tried - failed - score political points. The Democrats, grown protectionist-minded trade, commanding majority US Senate House Representatives. Obama, Democrat, careful cultivate good relations take granted support, desperately needs push ambitious economic policy agenda. It Congress 2007 introduced 100% rule, requiring US-bound containers leaving European ports scanned loaded onto departing ship. This thorn EU's side ever since features TEC agenda. In current climate, Congress unlikely clamouring scrap rule may even wish extend 2012 implementation deadline EU asking. Anxious burn bridges, Obama could well go along Congress order avoid unnecessary fight. AMERICANS NOT SO HOT ON TRADE Congress' protectionism magically appear vacuum. It reflective mounting fears among US public impact free trade US jobs. Their fears entirely groundless. American manufacturing jobs indeed going overseas - notably India China. And unemployed US perilous predicament Europe government unemployment benefits less generous temporary. Moreover, Americans, unlike Europeans, health care paid employer lose job also lose health care. Hardly surprising, therefore, 59% Americans think trade good country, compared 78% French British, 80% Czechs 85% Germans, Pew Research Centre survey shown. This bearish sentiment knock-on effect trade dossiers. For example, makes Congress less amenable scrapping law requiring US airlines 'actual control' US citizens - something EU urging current Open Sky II aviation liberalisation talks. It makes US lawmakers likely take action prevent European companies winning lucrative US defence contracts. This happening already epic tussle Boeing Airbus Pentagon's US$35 billion refuelling tanker contract (see separate article). EU officials clinging hope Obama, president, adopt global outlook drag Democratic Congress along rather way around. A VICTIM OF DULLNESS? The TEC, despite failed deliver much many hoped for, remains extremely useful tool. By emphasising regulatory rather tariff barriers, shows understanding real problems lie today's trading environment. The EU US could use TEC create global standard hugely important sectors, toys food. "The alternative," Dan Hamilton, director Centre Transatlantic Relations Johns Hopkins University Washington notes, "is end Chinese standards". Yet TEC one weakness one underestimate: dullness. Discussing highly technical regulatory divergences, whether wash chickens chlorine water, may Chancellor Merkel's cup tea French President Nicolas Sarkozy showed little interest French EU Presidency. Without strong impetus someone Obama's team power make things happen, TEC - like old soldier - might actually die fade away.

But ask American CEOs business leaders turn Washington help getting fair shake foreign markets untying global trade knots, learn officials rely on. Yet today, every export dollar trade-supported job essential America's economic recovery, key positions sit empty. And, surprisingly, five seats empty stalls behind-the-scenes maneuvers Senate Republicans — usually key allies U.S. business. In case, names went months ago.

But U.S. businesses also hurt. When American companies find commercial trade disputes abroad, face unfair competition foreign companies discriminatory practices regulators, turn directly roster above. With chairs empty, U.S. businesses problems abroad find facing classic Goldilocks problem — Cabinet secretaries big (and busy), officials small impact right levels. Moreover, international economic issues greatest interest U.S. businesses precisely ones hampered vacancies: balanced coordinated growth Great Recession, promotion job- generating U.S. exports, delayed trade agreements Colombia Panama, barriers Brazil's huge market, trade tensions Canada (our largest trading partner) security border issues Mexico (our second-largest), among many others.

"We're prepared start peace talks immediately," notoriously reluctant Israeli Prime Minister proclaimed, U.S. Secretary State Hillary Clinton standing side, poker-faced. "I think ... get get it." It ploy, course. The Palestinians tangled themselves, yet again. They elections looming, leader, Mahmoud Abbas, hang tough: demanding total freeze Israeli settlement-building West Bank — precisely Obama Administration previously said favored.

It "unprecedented" offer, Netanyahu trumpeted, joy chess master springing trap.(See photos 60 years Israel.) It tough moment Clinton, playing second fiddle Bibi-does-Gandhi show. President Barack Obama softened language settlements weeks earlier: instead total freeze, talked Israeli "restraint" settlement-building. And Clinton seemed cement Administration's retreat, agreeing Netanyahu's proposal was, indeed, "unprecedented," even though U.S. still favored total freeze. The important thing, added, parties get table quickly possible. The onus back Palestinians — Palestinians quickly expressed outrage Obama Administration's retreat. Their Arab neighbors soon joined in, causing Clinton backtrack two days later, telling reporters Israeli plan "falls far short" U.S. expectations, although still insisted calling "unprecedented," neither diplomatic wise. Suddenly Obama Administration seemed wobbly Middle East; clearly, Clinton bullish Netanyahu's proposal (which negotiated months Middle East envoy George Mitchell seen, privately, Americans real progress). But Administration's mission get parties peace talks without preconditions. The Israelis favor talks. The Palestinians setting preconditions. And Clinton violated essential rule job: boring almost always better.(See photos life career former Secretary State Madeleine Albright.)

You go Jerusalem Ramallah; stand "guardedly optimistic" public; private, try move comma, Israelis Palestinians move semicolon block comma. The result almost always same: gridlock. The breakthroughs, come, emanate others. Walter Cronkite asks Anwar Sadat he'd willing go Jerusalem ... Sadat, everyone's surprise, says yes. The Israelis Palestinians hold secret meetings Oslo reach appears breakthrough — they're talking! — becomes another dead end. The job Secretary State thankless glamorous; ways, Department State, noble antique, still trying come terms invention telephone. In era Twitter haiku-messaging rules, diplomacy moves speed, requires nuanced complexity, literature. Power drifted State National Security Council Pentagon, especially wartime. Only Clinton's recent predecessors distinguished themselves. Henry Kissinger, National Security Adviser belatedly became Secretary State, Richard Nixon's schizophrenic alter ego; George Shultz strong policy voice Reagan Administration; James Baker clout George H.W. Bush's best friend world-class dealmaker. Most others frustrated forgettable. And yet Hillary Clinton we're talking — second popular American world, eternally compelling supremely talented character, subject constant speculation, walking headline. Her presence job makes crucial more. It cliché say naming Clinton, Obama brought popular potential opponent tent. The conventional wisdom, cynical half, thereby succeeded neutering her, theory bolstered Clinton's reticence first nine months job, special envoys like Mitchell Richard Holbrooke heavy lifting diplomacy. But naming Clinton, Obama also gave great power, cuts ways: becomes dissatisfied role Administration's policies, become torpedo aimed Oval Office. Colin Powell similar power real gripe — Iraq war — never used it. Clinton gripe, Obama Administration settles policy differences begin emerge among key players, Powell conundrum looms: How Clinton choose use power? How Obama react does? Traditionally, Secretary State judged ability formulate policy, negotiate deals manage striped-pants bureaucracy. Clinton history global strategist, although performance 2008 campaign indicates bit conservative President, foreign policy realist Wilsonian idealist. It also early judge skill manager negotiator — although performance Jerusalem indicates needs lessons Middle East Haggling 101. There are, however, three qualities could make memorable Secretary State. She brings vision departmental reform — need elevate foreign aid programs status rigorous scrutiny diplomacy — could change striped pants chinos developing world. She also first elected politician hold office since Edmund Muskie briefly Carter Administration, enabled better understand interact politicians run places like Afghanistan Pakistan. But important, international celebrity much higher profile recent predecessors ability — second President's — change negative attitudes U.S. abroad. She potential become powerful public diplomat U.S. fielded quite time, although performance far, home abroad, occasionally perplexing. At home, often seemed tentative deferential. In conversation Secretary Defense Robert Gates aired CNN early October, Clinton's cautious formality took backseat Gates' brisk, humorous confidence policy issues. Abroad, seems far confident, times point recklessness, Jerusalem. (See photos last days Hillary Clinton's campaign.)

The trip, planned Holbrooke Pakistan specialist Vali Nasr, offered unusually subtle itinerary U.S. diplomatic mission. A visit Sufi mosque bombed Sunni extremists, example, sent powerful message Pakistan's moderate Islamic majority. "We saw praying there," academic named Shala Aziz told me, "and, first time, I'm thinking, The Americans hearts."(See photos suicide bombings Islamabad.) The big news Clinton allowed hammered hostile questions students, talk-show hosts Pashtun elders — that, occasion, pushed back, raising incredibly sensitive issues, like one Pakistani government knew Osama bin Laden was, even though country since 2002. Press accounts either emphasized embarrassment Secretary State's getting pummeled fixed Clinton's undiplomatic bluntness. But missed point: candor, willingness listen acknowledge criticism, begun undermine prevailing Pakistani image U.S. arrogant bossy, interested Pakistani military fight war al-Qaeda Taliban true strategic partnership. The contrast especially sharp George W. Bush's eight years unqualified support military dictatorship Pervez Musharraf. "In past, Americans came, would talk generals go home," said Farahnaz Ispahani, government spokeswoman Member Parliament. "Clinton's willingness meet everyone, hostile not, made big impression — she's Hillary Clinton, real history affinity country, means much more." Transformative Experience There toasts state dinners Pakistan, alcohol. There opening statements, though, Clinton's — delivered impromptu first night trip tossing aside notes — surprisingly emotional. Earlier day, President Asif Ali Zardari, widower Benazir Bhutto, presented Secretary album photos first visit Pakistan, 1995, framed photo Bhutto two sons Clinton daughter Chelsea. "It bring tears eyes," Clinton said state dinner honor presidential palace, "because I admired wife. She gave life ..." She faltered then, choking up, quickly pulled together, talking "reasons — provide opportunities all." Clinton's first trip Pakistan First Lady 1995 transformative experience — beginning, I believe, process made plausible candidate Secretary State. I traveled trip; set off, seemed depressed even private usual. The Democrats cratered 1994 congressional elections, trounced efforts enact universal health care plan. It personal defeat; Clinton traveled country trying sell plan, crowds shouted cursed her. Privately admitted shocked hatred. The trip South Asia seemed bit vacation — Chelsea's spring break — also retreat demure, First Lady–like role two years health care policy czar, although proceeded decidedly wonky, Hillarian fashion.

When Clinton Bhutto met formally, first day 1995 trip, hit immediately, part Bhutto also obsessed impact Islamist tide women children. I remember asking Bhutto day biggest change country past 25 years, said, "I used able walk street wearing jeans, without headscarf. Now I can't." When I asked why, said — bluntly — "The Saudis," aggressively funding religious schools. Of course, Bhutto's acquiescence to, participation in, general corruption Pakistani government part reason public schools inadequate madrasahs became popular. (See photos aftermath Benazir Bhutto's assassination 2007.) Ironically, rise Sunni extremist groups like al-Qaeda brought Clinton's interests — microfinance, education health care — center national-security policy first time. The impetus came State Department military, counterinsurgency doctrine demanded social services war zones — schools, justice, economic development — reinforce military's efforts secure population. As result, immediate chemistry Clinton General David Petraeus, author Army's counterinsurgency manual, became one prime military mentors served Senate Armed Services Committee. At one point, well Obama made presidential intentions known, I asked Petraeus potential Democratic candidate understood mind worked, said, "You mean, aside Hillary?" It Clinton brought together Petraeus Holbrooke ("my two alpha males," calls them) first time — home Washington Friday Obama Inauguration. The affection respect gained military serving Senate helped make relationship State Pentagon less fraught usual — although Defense Secretary Gates' insistence need bigger State Department budgets hasn't hurt. In fact, relations Pentagon gone smoother, times, Clinton's relationship White House staff. Clinton particularly irritated ridiculously strict vetting process thwarted favored candidate USAID director, Paul Farmer, getting job. "It sorts niggling things," says Clinton adviser, "like, Farmer one point brought $10,000 cash Haiti. The money needle-exchange program, amount illegal." Another Clinton's military mentors, retired General Jack Keane, told me, "I'm Republican. I disagree practically everything, she'd make hell Commander Chief." There palpable toughness woman, hard edge contrasts President's instinctive impulse toward conciliation. One sharpest exchanges presidential campaign came Obama accused Clinton echoing "bluster" George W. Bush said U.S. would able "obliterate" Iran used nuclear weapons Israel. Clinton's edgier tone evident start Administration: took sharper position President Israeli settlement freeze claiming, May, Obama wanted "to see stop settlements. Not settlements, outposts, natural-growth exceptions." And then, Jerusalem, use word unprecedented seemed rhetorical leap beyond No Drama ground rules.(Read "Clinton's Collateral Damage.") The White House entirely thrilled either statement. But White House staff several steps removed negotiating process. The Palestinians weak divided. The Israelis difficult, always: whenever Mitchell raises East Jerusalem talks Israeli Foreign Minister, Israeli stands walks room. Despite Netanyahu's momentary, tactical enthusiasm peace talks, Likud Party always favored de facto incorporation Palestinian lands state Israel. Hillary's Choice The tensions White House State raise fascinating question going forward. Obama Clinton substantive agreement President's diplomacy-first philosophy policy issues — although neither willing disclose content private conversations — style often predicts substance foreign policy; neither Obama's gauziness Clinton's inconsistent bluntness overseas seems particularly solid.

The White House argues progress made: Iran defensive, North Korea said return six-party talks. Clinton argues, correctly, need "strategic patience." But thing Obama really show efforts far Nobel Prize Potential — small thing — wisdom refrained anything wildly stupid invading Iraq. The President willing use military force — Predator drones decimated al-Qaeda's leadership testify lack squeamishness — Administration supposed efficacy using subtler expressions U.S. power. That doesn't happen overnight, Obama's policies considered success, happen sooner later, way explained public. There also growing sense President's inexperience beginning show — overall policy, represents views broad, moderate national-security consensus ranging Brent Scowcroft John Kerry, execution details. The Afghan strategy review public taken long; Middle East peace hunt become wild goose chase. A letter Iran's Supreme Leader productive gesture gets response; doesn't, seems weak supplicatory. A call Israelis freeze settlements effective accompanied credible threat reduction aid. "You can't seen pushing countries around — demanding [that] Israel freeze settlements, demanding Hamid Karzai reform government — get results," says Leslie H. Gelb, author Power Rules. "The leaders countries tough, successful politicians, they'll begin take less seriously." (See photos 1979 revolution Iran.) Clinton unwilling acknowledge problems, staff loath admit occasional mistakes. Her praise President fulsome, aides say relationship Obama really — really — strong.

The US British press mostly reported war 2001 real military conflict rather missed point Taliban gone home.

If Americans British try hold territory supposedly cleared Taliban penny packets troops vulnerable suddenly targeted side. It prevent happening Gen McChrystal asked extra 40,000 soldiers. But Afghans tell foreign troops simply mean violence dead Afghans country becomes battlefield. It absurd imagine world's heavily equipped military force going use weapons comes attack.

One way Obama could strengthen Afghan army police make sure men paid properly. In Kabul many facilities guarded policemen earning $70 month, enough live unless supplemented bribes.

A Turkish Kurd, Parlak granted political asylum 1992. It government got cozier Turkey, re-classified Kurdish separatist movement "terrorist" attacks Sept. 11. With 9/11, Ibrahim Parlak's horror began anew. Suddenly looked different newly created Department Homeland Security Justice Department's Immigration courts. Instead seeing hard-working, tax-paying Chamber Commerce member ran Cafe Gulistan, small Middle Eastern restaurant resort town Harbert, Mich., tlie feds saw international menace. In 2004, FBI grabbed Parlak locked up. If hadn't volunteer team lawyers, including Reagan-appointed former U.S. attorney, former FBI anti- terrorism legal adviser bipartisan intervention Michigan's Sen. Carl Levin, liberal Democrat, Rep. Fred Upton, conservative Republican, Parlak would still jail. Thanks them, 47-year-old father 12-year-old girl temporarily free. But barely.

Judge Boyce F. Martin, Carter appointee, writes clarity conviction, arguing government's "awesome power used railroad man country." Like surgeon, Martin dissects Justice Department's immigration courts majority opinion colleagues, ends saying, "I remain hopeful, nevertheless, case sad remnant era paranoid, overzealous, error-riddled misguided anti-terrorism immigration enforcement gone wayside. It shame that, even hope proves true, late Ibrahim Parlak." Parlak's legal team appeal. Meanwhile, Holder, like Ashcroft Gonzales him, new boss immigration courts. As investigates questions U.S. torture abroad, here's hoping Holder examines ongoing domestic legal torture Ibrahim Parlak.

But frighteningly closer. And irony screams out. Carol Mann On Monday, day Eric Holder, President Obama's attorney general, announced would appoint special counsel investigate whether torture used CIA extract confessions foreign suspects, U.S. appeals court behest U.S. government ruled didn't problem sending Parlak back country tortured -- imprisoned 17 months, shocked electrodes, hung arms sexually violated.

It government got cozier Turkey, re-classified Kurdish separatist movement "terrorist" attacks Sept. 11. With 9/11, Ibrahim Parlak's horror began anew. Suddenly looked different newly created Department Homeland Security Justice Department's Immigration courts. Instead seeing hard-working, tax-paying Chamber Commerce member ran Cafe Gulistan, small Middle Eastern restaurant resort town Harbert, Mich., feds saw international menace. In 2004, FBI grabbed Parlak locked up. If hadn't volunteer team lawyers, including Reagan-appointed former U.S. attorney, former FBI anti- terrorism legal adviser bipartisan intervention Michigan's Sen. Carl Levin, liberal Democrat, Rep. Fred Upton, conservative Republican, Parlak would still jail. Thanks them, 47-year-old father 12-year-old girl temporarily free. But barely. The newest outrage 2-1 decision issued Cincinnati's 6th Circuit Court Appeals day Holder launched torture inquiry. The majority opinion issued two Bush appointees put bench 9/11. Judge Julia Smith Gibbons Judge Jeffrey Sutton upheld Justice Department's Immigration courts ruling Parlak failed disclose relationship now-labeled terrorist organization even though never proven member. Let's remember something immigration courts. They independent. They work whoever attorney general. And past rulings Parlak came two now-controversial Bush appointees, John Ashcroft Alberto Gonzales. The fairness immigration rulings ripped none Judge Richard Posner 7th Circuit Court Appeals, one nation's brilliant judges. By September 2005, Posner noted "a staggering 40 percent 136 petitions" reversed due to, according one ruling, willingness ignore "the basic facts." Echoing Posner dissenting judge Parlak appeal. Judge Boyce F. Martin, Carter appointee, writes clarity conviction, arguing government's "awesome power used railroad man country." Like surgeon, Martin dissects Justice Department's immigration courts majority opinion colleagues, ends saying, "I remain hopeful, nevertheless, case sad remnant era paranoid, overzealous, error-riddled misguided anti-terrorism immigration enforcement gone wayside. It shame that, even hope proves true, late Ibrahim Parlak." Parlak's legal team appeal. Meanwhile, Holder, like Ashcroft Gonzales him, new boss immigration courts. As investigates questions U.S. torture abroad, here's hoping Holder examines ongoing domestic legal torture Ibrahim Parlak.

From day one, goal enact legislation offers stability security insurance affordable coverage don't, lowers costs families, businesses governments across country. Majority Leader Reid, Chairmen Baucus Dodd, countless Senators worked tirelessly craft legislation meets principles. Just yesterday, bipartisan group 20 leading health economists released letter urging passage meaningful reform praising four key provisions Senate legislation: fee insurance companies offering high-premium plans, establishment independent Medicare commission, reforms health care delivery system, overall deficit neutrality. The economists said provisions 'will reduce long-term deficits, improve quality care, put nation firm fiscal footing.' Those precisely goals seeking attain. The challenges facing health care system aren't new — fail act they'll surely get even worse, meaning higher premiums, skyrocketing costs, deeper instability coverage. Today, thanks Senate's hard work, we're closer ever enacting solutions problems. I look forward working Senate House get finished bill desk soon possible." ### UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760390 Date: 06/30/2015

It transatlantic lines communication, strong years ago, fallen disuse. There feeling that, even reached Oval Office, would one willing take Britain's call. • For weeks now, President Obama deliberating Afghan strategy — many troops send. If confusion Washington, Britain's strategy much clearer. Gordon Brown staged recent flurry activity subject, writing misspelt letters grieving mothers demanding exit strategy established withdrawal British forces. Yet among top brass, general perception Prime Minister little interest war. • It often Brown regards Afghan campaign dead fish Tony Blair left top drawer Downing Street desk. It infected premiership foul odour, wants rid soon possible. This explains promise, Monday, set timetable withdrawal British troops earliest available opportunity. The signal sent exit sight, approached. • Brown's approach hardly squares Foreign Secretary's assertion, made next day address Nato's Parliamentary Assembly, British forces remain Afghans strong enough take care affairs. Miliband might faults, obsessive enthusiasm Europe. But sound Afghanistan — unlike prime minister — articulate well-informed advocate Nato cause. One feeling that, Mr Obama able talk Afghanistan, Mr Miliband could decent conversation him. But fact policy divisions starting appear London symptomatic far deeper malaise lies heart Afghan policy-making; malaise threatens jeopardise success entire mission. And malaise absence meaningful dialogue White House hitherto stalwart reliable ally, particularly comes messy business confronting Islamist militants force arms. • We good giggle Brown reduced chasing Leader Free World subterranean kitchen complex UN's New York headquarters September. One understand Obama think million better ways spend time talking obsessive, nail-chewing electorally doomed prime minister. But given Britain America currently fighting war together; one would hope true statesman would overcome personal reservations deal Mr Brown country represents. What really troubles British policymakers collapse relationship institutional, personal, president little interest listening Britain say many world issues, even time British servicemen women sacrificing lives supposed common cause. • The astonishing disregard Mr Obama treats Britain made clear deliberations Afghan issue. As decides many troops send Afghanistan — decision fundamentally affect scope mission — Britain reduced guesswork. The White House even pretend portray joint decision.

The strength American military might many times available Britain but, senior officer tell you, either side Atlantic, close joined hip. From moment sign up, young American British officers train together, socialise together — since 9/11 — fought died together. • The relaxed familiarity two martial traditions reflected warmth General Stanley McChrystal, American commander Nato forces Afghanistan, referred recent visit London British contemporaries `Jatko', General Sir Michael Jackson, former head British army, lamby', Lt-Gen Sir Graeme Lamb, currently spending well-earned retirement Kabul helping devise new counter- insurgency strategy defeat Taleban. So far Afghanistan concerned, would fair say American British military commanders singing Afghan prayer mat. • Indeed, shortage enthusiasm part British military, Whitehall departments involved Afghan campaign, support Obama announced last March new counter- insurgency strategy based Iraq-like military 'surge'. McChrystal personally appointed Obama make policy success, General Sir David Richards, former commander Nato forces Afghanistan, one number senior army officers quickly got behind new initiative. So, too, redoubtable Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, former ambassador Kabul, drafted numerous briefing documents making case greater co-operation cohesion within Whitehall, development comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy encompassed participants, military. So now, bright initiatives? Why Foreign.Office senior military commanders much dark anyone else strategy Afghanistan be? We don't know, Mr Obama busy cosying new churns Moscow Beijing tell us. And stumble around policy darkness, inevitable tendency make go along. Hence conflicting policy edicts issued week Messrs Brown Miliband. • The trouble started summer, Obama appears change heart and, rather proceeding Afghan strategy announced March, decided undertake review instead. And process provided us telling insight expect Obama presidency function future. Much criticism, home abroad, concerning Afghan policy review tended focus accusations White House dithering which, nearly three half months, entirely without foundation. But far worrying countries, Britain, looked forward co-operating Obama's apparent desire reach engage America's allies exclusivity style decision- making — call that. As General McChrystal found cost, Obama inner circle Chicago pols take kindly second-guessed whose advice seek, every right reject. There reason doubt McChrystal's gloomy prediction — generally endorsed Whitehall — without extra 40,000 Nato troops Afghan mission doomed failure. But talk Obama aide days tell that, fine soldier though undoubtedly is, McChrystal politically naive, spoke turn thoroughly regrets day ever set foot London think tank, stated case explicitly White House's liking. One recent two-hour Afghan strategy meeting spent 24 minutes discussing whether McChrystal right man job all. In words, use phrase- °logy popular Chicago, he's dead meat. • Obama, meanwhile, made deliberations secretive three people whole Washington — and, ergo, rest world — know precisely mind, none talking. Even President George \N. Bush, frequently criticised arrogance unilateralism, better this. From 9/11 Iraq war, kept Tony Blair trusted allies (there weren't many, let's face it) fully briefed planning — much Blair accused colluding invade Iraq spring 2002. • But Obama regular video-conferences bringing Downing Street date latest White House thinking. No special envoys making secret visits London keep key players informed. Instead wait, like everyone else, puffs smoke White House — expected around Thanksgiving holiday — find Obama really intends Afghanistan. He is, many ways, AWOL ally.

The Poles, rightly sensitive security used bargaining chip negotiations super-power neighbours, make late-night call Hillary Clinton eve announcement — Poles understandably turned call, breach manners protocol. In keenness befriend Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, Obama taken account widespread European unease concerning mood resurgent nationalism sweeping Moscow? Not chance. • And judge recent peregrinations around Far East, seems Obama far interested making new friends taking trouble keep old acquaintances. The enthusiasm displayed bumped Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's Prime Minister, week's Apec summit Singapore considerably greater shown many European allies. Not Medvedev indignity conducting important bilateral discussions kitchens surrounded vats boiling noodles. And Beijing Obama spent convivial evening President Hu Jintao, discussing evolution histories China America. Being American ally never seemed unrewarding. • There will, though, inevitably come time Obama discovers America's true friends really are. Sooner later deal considerably taxing issues Islamist militancy, rogue nuclear states tangible threats West's security. At point, Obama discover simple essential truth. The world divides support American values freedom democracy, seek destroy them. • Few nations committed supporting values blood treasure Britain.

It looked like administration run trouble quickly, former ambassador Washington said. People saying effort getting big tax cuts medical prescription benefits older people Congress "killed" Bush, Meyer said. He added secretary state Colin Powell's efforts narrow deepen sanctions Iraq failed "huge bear market" Donald Rumsfeld, defence secretary.

Powell sceptical "belligerent" moves, concentrating sanctions Robin Cook, then-British foreign secretary, whom, Meyer said, "somewhat surprise", got well. On 9/11 Condoleezza Rice, US national security adviser, told Meyer "no doubt: al-Qaida operation". The following weekend Bush key advisers met Camp David contacts later told Meyer "big ding-dong" Iraq Saddam. It seemed Paul Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld's deputy, argued retaliation include Iraq, Meyer said. It clear Rumsfeld stood. But later month Bush Tony Blair, visit Washington, agreed "laser-like focus" al-Qaida Pakistan. Blair's reputation soared "above others" support US, former ambassador told inquiry. But anthrax scare "steamed up" policy makers Bush's administration helped swing attitudes Saddam, administration believed last person use anthrax. Rice fell "in camp Powell's enemies". There "sea change" attitudes containment UK still "a legal problem" regime change. Meyer told British officials argue alliance would better shape international support military action. There need argue state department. But Dick Cheney, vice-president, Rumsfeld. Asked Blair's meeting Bush Crawford, Texas, April 2002, where, observers believe, decision go war made, Meyer said: "To day I'm entirely clear degree convergence signed blood Texas range." But speech Blair following day was, believed, first time prime minister publicaly said "regime change". "What trying draw lessons 9/11 apply situation Iraq, led —! think inadvertently deliberately — conflation threat posed Osama bin Laden Saddam Hussein.

"I don't think invalidated point programmes had. It use," said. But set tone. On Thursday, Sir Christopher Meyer, UK ambassador Washington 1997 2003, already criticised government Iraq memoirs, went Blair, mercilessly comparing qualities war leader Margaret Thatcher. "I'm trying make party political point whatsoever, quite often I. think this: would Margaret Thatcher done?" Meyer asked. "I think would insisted coherent political diplomatic strategy would demanded greatest clarity heck happened if, when, removed Saddam Hussein." A former press secretary John Major speak like mandarin but, equally, talk like layman, said Blair failed miserably extract price George Bush loyalty. "We could achieved playing tougher role... if, example... Tony Blair said: 'I want help you, George, this, I say, honesty, I able take part military operation unless palpable progress [Middle East] peace process absolute clarity happens Iraq comes up.'

He added: "I regard participation military action Iraq March 2003 legal questionable legitimacy, democratically observable backing great majority [UN] member states, even perhaps majority people inside UK." Today new arguments raging whether inquiry access to, publish, sensitive documents — including legal advice given government former attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, lead-up war. Nick Clegg, Liberal Democrat leader, written Gordon Brown saying that, unless material published, inquiry sham public's sense denied facts remain. But still essential viewing nonetheless. This week see key witnesses. The revealing testimony could come tomorrow Sir David Manning, Blair's former foreign policy <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/foreignpolicy> adviser, certain asked authorship memo purportedly revealed details secret meeting Bush Blair January 2003. According reports, five pages secret documents, known Manning memo, recorded White House meeting 31 January allegedly shows Bush Blair made deal carry invasion regardless whether weapons mass destruction discovered UN weapons inspectors. It appears direct contradiction statements Blair made parliament afterwards Saddarn would given final chance disarm. The memo also disclosed Bush floated idea painting U-2 spyplane UN colours letting fly low Iraq provoke Saddam ordering shot down, providing pretext subsequent invasion America Britain. Manning, educated Oriel College, Oxford, career diplomat, fiercely independent. He may choose say Blair would like, according one former colleague. He could also asked either confirm deny Meyer's evidence Meyer received "new instructions" early 2005 indicating "complete waste time" oppose regime change, strong US determination go road. On Tuesday, Edward Chaplin, Foreign Office Middle East director time invasion, Sir Peter Ricketts, top official Foreign Office, appear. Ricketts, former chairman Britain's powerful joint intelligence committee, already given evidence inquiry alleging officials London knew even Bush came office 2001 "voices" Washington calling Saddam removed power. Ricketts also told inquiry that, March 2002, Whitehall distanced regime change. Only one month later, Blair told Bush would support military action "to bring regime change". According documents leaked five years ago, Ricketts described US 2002 "scrambling establish link Iraq al-Qaida" — connection "so far, frankly unconvincing". On Thursday, Sir Kevin Tebbit, Ministry Defence's permanent secretary invasion, asked give evidence military planning. Chilcot will, likely, want know government first began amass resources war what, any, preparations made aftermath invasion. Tebbit could also urged divulge level intelligence received likelihood attack chemical biological weapons. After Tebbit, succession heavy-hitting military men give evidence. The former chief defence staff, Admiral Lord Boyce, could asked whether believes invasion legal. On Friday, Lieutenant General Sir Anthony Pigott, former deputy chief defence staff, Major General David Wilson, senior British military adviser US military's central command 2002 2003, questioned military planning conflict. The last witness appear week Dominic Asquith, Britain's ambassador Iraq 2006 2007, come armed knowledge view Baghdad. When Chilcot made way officials, turn new year former ministers, including Jack Straw, former foreign secretary, Blair himself. The panel said also begin examine highly controversial issue whether invasion legal — may turn focal point whole inquiry — January. In final report, expected late 2010 earliest, Chilcot said seek attribute blame. But one week already clear much Whitehall believes lies. The Washington Post Afghanistan: The speech you'll miss By Jim Hoagland UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760498 Date: 06/30/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760498 Date: 06/30/2015 Sunday, November 29, 2009 Dec. 1, 2009: My fellow Americans, This speech expected hear. But wordsmiths tied knots writing acceptance speech Nobel Peace Prize ever awarded making speeches. So I going tell I really feel Afghanistan. Which is: steamed. 1 want accomplish three goals tonight without naming them. First, let know-it-alls, Generals Petraeus McChrystal, know one thing: This last big troop increase get, make work. ! going incrementalist road wrecked Lyndon Johnson's presidency. This July 1965, Westmoreland jumped shark escalation Vietnam never stopped asking troops. For trouble been, Dick Holbrooke helped recalling history shadowboxing dominated long war council meetings. Joe Biden good there, too. He's willing, though happy, characterized media ready bug now. This helped us push back McChrystal's effort box 40,000 addrtional U.S. soldiers. Denis McDonough, strategic communications man, sold Biden-as-dove brilliantly. Wasn't somebody saying I promote Denis? Maybe Denis? Never mind. That tactic won room maneuver toward realistic number of, say, 23,000 new combat troops, 5,000 additional trainers "NATO surge" 5,000 foreign troops. That's second unspoken goal: come buildup speech without losing left Democratic Party -- able refute John McCain's charges I ignored generals. Triangulation lives. Bush put generals limelight sell Iraq surge lost credibility, David Petraeus's performance dazzling. Which presents two big problems. Petraeus person could get Republican nomination 2012 make serious run me. (I get paid think ahead.) And generals box in, civilian control military country becomes mockery. Clinton afraid military; Bush deep hock it. I've got get right balance back. That's I need Bob Gates Jim Jones. Those scoffed keeping Bush's defense secretary, making retired Marine four-star I hardly knew NSC guy, thinking moments like would come. I already was. Gates maneuvered flawlessly waterboarding-by-leaks Afghanistan. He sell final number uniforms "floor" U.S. troops Petraeus argues need three years. But Gates knows I make ceiling. We can't afford open-ended commitment. I put Peter Orszag, good budget overseer find, front center photographers last war council. Many missed it, NBC's Andrea Mitchell got right away. No wonder she's married Alan Greenspan. I bet Stan McChrystaI never drew budget life. Jones tells Special Operations commanders used getting whatever ask for, especially since September 11th. Nobody Hill deny anything. Jones also squeezing Europeans join battle getting results, even Germans. What Jones says? Maybe worst thing would perceived lose Afghanistan Europeans say: Well, never asked help crucial time. Makes sense me. We sent NATO members numbers think provide, country country. That new secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, pulling stops, visiting capitals get commitments. "Say now, pay later," tell Europeans. They mid-2010 deploy new units. But I need pledges !can get across tonight NATO's war, Obama's war. That's unspoken-goal number three. So I frontloaded speech allusions exit strategy, without boxing timing, presenting "civilian surge" essential troop buildup. That helps set Oslo speech. And knows? may even work way. If God blesses us all. UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760498 Date: 06/30/2015

A former press secretary John Major speak like mandarin but, equally, talk like layman, said Blair failed miserably extract price George Bush loyalty.

The revealing testimony could come tomorrow Sir David Manning, Blair's former foreign policy <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/foreignpolicy> adviser, certain asked authorship memo purportedly revealed details secret meeting Bush Blair January 2003. According reports, five pages secret documents, known Manning memo, recorded White House meeting 31 January allegedly shows Bush Blair made deal carry invasion regardless whether weapons mass destruction discovered UN weapons inspectors.

According documents leaked five years ago, Ricketts described US 2002 "scrambling establish link Iraq al-Qaida" — connection "so far, frankly unconvincing". On Thursday, Sir Kevin Tebbit, Ministry Defence's permanent secretary invasion, asked give evidence military planning.

In final report, expected late 2010 earliest, Chilcot said seek attribute blame. But one week already clear much Whitehall believes lies. The Washington Post Afghanistan: The speech you'll miss By Jim Hoagiand Sunday, November 29, 2009 Dec. 1, 2009: My fellow Americans, This speech expected hear. But wordsmiths tied knots writing acceptance speech Nobel Peace Prize ever awarded making speeches. So I going tell I really feel Afghanistan. Which is: steamed. I want accomplish three goals tonight without naming them. First, let know-it-ails, Generals Petraeus McChrystal, know one thing: This last big troop increase get, make work. I going incrementalist road wrecked Lyndon Johnson's presidency. This July 1965, Westmoreland jumped shark escalation Vietnam never stopped asking troops. For trouble been, Dick Holbrooke helped recalling history shadowboxing dominated long war council meetings. Joe Biden good there, too. He's willing, though happy, characterized media ready bug now. This helped us push back McChrystal's effort box 40,000 additional U.S. soldiers. Denis McDonough, strategic communications man, sold Biden-as-dove brilliantly. Wasn't somebody saying I promote Denis? Maybe Denis? Never mind. That tactic won room maneuver toward realistic number of, say, 23,000 new combat troops, 5,000 additional trainers "NATO surge" 5,000 foreign troops. That's second unspoken goal: come buildup speech without losing left Democratic Party -- able refute John McCain's charges I ignored generals. Triangulation lives. Bush put generals limelight sell Iraq surge lost credibility, David Petraeus's performance dazzling. Which presents two big problems. Petraeus person could get Republican nomination 2012 make serious run me. (I get paid think ahead.) And generals box in, civilian control military country becomes mockery. Clinton afraid military; Bush deep hock it. I've got get right balance back. That's I need Bob Gates Jim Jones. Those scoffed keeping Bush's defense secretary, making retired Marine four-star I hardly knew NSC guy, thinking moments like would come. I already was. Gates maneuvered flawlessly waterboarding-by-leaks Afghanistan. He sell final number uniforms "floor" U.S. troops Petraeus argues need three years. But Gates knows I make ceiling. We can't afford open-ended commitment. I put Peter Orszag, good budget overseer find, front center photographers last war council. Many missed it, NBC's Andrea Mitchell got right away. No wonder she's married Alan Greenspan.

Jones tells Special Operations commanders used getting whatever ask for, especially since September 11th. Nobody Hill deny anything. Jones also squeezing Europeans join battle getting results, even Germans. What Jones says? Maybe worst thing would perceived lose Afghanistan Europeans say: Well, never asked help crucial time. Makes sense me. We sent NATO members numbers think provide, country country. That new secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, pulling stops, visiting capitals get commitments. "Say now, pay later," tell Europeans. They mid-2010 deploy new units. But I need pledges I get across tonight NATO's war, Obama's war. That's unspoken-goal number three. So I frontloaded speech allusions exit strategy, without boxing timing, presenting "civilian surge" essential troop buildup. That helps set Oslo speech. And knows? It may even work way. If God blesses us all. UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760499 Date: 06/30/2015

Really worth reading. This Week Copenhagen December 12, 2009 Editorial We didn't expect much first week global warming conference Copenhagen. Countries need little posturing getting hard work, supposed start Monday. But belligerent talk China seemed go well beyond usual positioning. • •The best hope talks produce interim understanding industrialized countries would commit fairly precise targets reduced emissions, others, like China, broader measurable goals. The industrial countries would expected help poorer countries shift less-polluting forms energy. That would set stage legally binding deal 2010. But chance even interim agreement without enthusiastic participation China, biggest emitter greenhouse gases. China's absence would give developing countries — United States Senate — excuse less needed. Beijing's recent pledge slow growth emissions seemed like positive shift attitude. Then Tuesday, surprising show defensiveness, China's top negotiator, Su Wei, said greatest burden rested industrialized countries jumped United States, Japan European Union aggressive enough. Another Chinese official urged Washington "some deep soul-searching" improve proposal. Todd Stern, chief American negotiator, responded correctly: With emissions many industrialized countries peaking declining, growth greenhouse gases expected come developing world 2030, half China. Rich nations must still reduce emissions sharply, Mr. Stern said, "there way solve problem giving major developing countries pass." China also demanding rich nations contribute hundreds millions dollars year help poor countries address threat climate change. Again Mr. Stern blunt. Washington prepared help need it, given China's huge reserves revved-up economy, said could envision "public funds, certainly United States, going China." The positive development pledge European Union contribute $10.5 billion next three years help poorer countries deal climate change. The United States said make contribution said big be. Transparency another difficult issue must resolved, least principle, week. There point setting targets, threatening penalties noncompliance, unless countries required report emissions accurately. Transparency never one Beijing's virtues, emerging countries generally need aid create sophisticated monitoring systems. Copenhagen's broadest challenge finding equitable way distribute burden confronting climate change. Despite differences, industrialized nations pretty much agreed trim emissions 15 percent 20 percent 2005 levels next 10 years, 80 percent midcentury. And seem willing make expensive investments get there. President Obama need help Congress, sure thing. A host developing countries — including India, Brazil, Indonesia — put broad goals table, though in.some cases seem aspirational real. But bottom line hope meaningful deal vanishingly small China doesn't sign on. UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761219 Date: 06/30/2015

I room As recriminations fly post-Copenhagen, one writer offers fly-on-the-wall account talks failed Mark Lynas <http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/marklynas> guardian.co.ul«http://www.guardian.co.uk> , Tuesday 22 December 2009 19.54 GMT Copenhagen disaster. That much agreed. But truth actually happened danger lost amid spin inevitable mutual recriminations. The truth this: China <http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china> wrecked talks, intentionally humiliated Barack Obama, insisted awful "deal" western leaders would walk away carrying blame. How I know this? Because I room saw happen. China's strategy simple: block open negotiations two weeks, ensure closed-door deal made look west failed world's poor again. And sure enough, aid agencies, civil society movements environmental groups took bait. The failure "the inevitable result rich countries refusing adequately fairly shoulder overwhelming responsibility", said Christian Aid. "Rich countries bullied developing nations," fumed Friends Earth International. All predictable, complete opposite truth. Even George Monbiot, writing yesterday's Guardian, made mistake singiy blaming Obama. But saw Obama fighting desperately salvage deal, Chinese delegate saying "no", again. Monbiot even approvingly quoted Sudanese delegate Lumumba Di-Aping, denounced Copenhagen accord "a suicide pact, incineration pact, order maintain economic dominance countries". Sudan behaves talks puppet China; one number countries relieves Chinese delegation fight battles open sessions. It perfect stitch-up. China gutted deal behind scenes, left proxies savage public. Here's actually went late last Friday night, heads state two dozen countries met behind closed doors. - Obama table several hours, sitting Gordon Brown Ethiopian prime minister, IVIeles Zenawi. The Danish prime minister chaired, right sat Ban Ki-moon, secretary-general UN. Probably 50 60 people, including heads state, room. I attached one delegations, whose head state also present time. What I saw profoundly shocking. The Chinese premier, Wen Jinbao, deign attend meetings personally, instead sending second-tier official country's foreign ministry sit opposite Obama himself. The diplomatic snub obvious brutal, practical implication: several times session, world's powerful heads state forced wait around Chinese delegate went make telephone calls "superiors". Shifting blame To would blame Obama rich countries general, know this: China's representative insisted industrialised country targets, previously agreed 80% cut 2050, taken deal. "Why can't UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762860 Date: 06/30/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762860 Date: 06/30/2015 even mention targets?" demanded furious Angela Merkel. Australia's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, annoyed enough bang microphone. Brazil's representative pointed illogicality China's position. Why rich countries announce even unilateral cut? The Chinese delegate said no, I watched, aghast, Merkel threw hands despair conceded point. Now know — China bet, correctly, Obama would get blame Copenhagen accord's lack ambition. China, backed times India, proceeded take numbers mattered. A 2020 peaking year global emissions, essential restrain temperatures 2C, removed replaced woolly language suggesting emissions peak "as soon possible". The long-term target, global 50% cuts 2050, also excised. No one else, perhaps exceptions India Saudi Arabia, wanted happen. I certain Chinese room, would left Copenhagen deal environmentalists popping champagne corks popping every corner world. Strong position So China manage pull coup? First, extremely strong negotiating position. China didn't need deal. As one developing country foreign minister said me: "The Athenians nothing offer Spartans." On hand, western leaders particular — also presidents Lula Brazil, Zuma South Africa, Caldenin Mexico many others — desperate positive outcome. Obama needed strong deal perhaps anyone. The US confirmed offer $100bn developing countries adaptation, put serious cuts table first time (17% 2005 levels 2020), obviously prepared offer. Above all, Obama needed able demonstrate Senate could deliver China global climate regulation framework, conservative senators could argue US carbon cuts would advantage Chinese industry. With midterm elections looming, Obama staff also knew Copenhagen would probably opportunity go climate change <http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/climate-change> talks strong mandate. This strengthened China's negotiating hand, complete lack civil society political pressure either China India. Campaign groups never blame developing countries failure; iron rule never broken. The Indians, particular, become past masters co-opting language equity ("equal rights atmosphere") service planetary suicide — ieftish campaigners commentators hoist petard. With deal gutted, heads state session concluded final battle Chinese delegate insisted removing 1.5C target beloved small island states low-lying nations lose rising seas. President Nasheed Maldives, supported Brown, fought valiantly save crucial number. "How ask country go extinct?" demanded Nasheed. The Chinese delegate feigned great offence — number stayed, surrounded language makes meaningless. The deed done. China's game All raises question: China's game? Why China, words UK-based analyst also spent hours heads state meetings, "not reject targets itself, also refuse allow country take binding targets?" The analyst, attended climate conferences 15 years, concludes China wants weaken climate regulation regime "in order avoid risk might called ambitious years' time". This mean China serious global warming. It strong wind solar industries. But China's growth, growing global political economic dominance, based largely cheap coal. China knows becoming uncontested superpower; indeed newfound muscular confidence striking display Copenhagen. Its coal-based economy doubles every decade, power increases commensurately. leadership alter magic formula unless absolutely to. Copenhagen much worse another bad deal, illustrated profound shift global geopolitics. This fast becoming China's century, yet leadership displayed multilateral environmental governance priority, viewed hindrance new superpower's freedom action. I left Copenhagen despondent I felt long time. After hope hype, mobilisation thousands, wave optimism crashed rock global power politics, fell back, drained away. <http://pix01.revsci.net/E05516/a3/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/noscript.gif> UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762860 Date: 06/30/2015

During years Senate Armed Services Committee, I saw Department Defense used Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) align resources, policies, strategies present — future. No similar mechanism existed modernizing State Department USAID. One first acts Secretary State 1 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015 appoint new Deputy Secretary charge managing systems resources. And July 2009, I launched first Quadrennial Diplomacy Development Review (QDDR), wholesale review State USAID recommend better equip, fund, organize meet current diplomatic development priorities begin building people, structures, processes, resources today address world's challenges years ahead. The QDDR simply review. It defines make diplomacy development coordinated, complementary, mutually reinforcing. It assesses worked past hasn't. And forecasts future strategic choices resource needs. While State Department USAID distinct roles missions, know diplomacy development often overlap — must often work tandem. Increasingly, global challenges call mix both, requiring us pursue holistic approach civilian power. Diplomatic objectives often effectively secured development gains. The resumption direct talks Israelis Palestinians summer handiwork talented persistent diplomats. But progress negotiating table directly linked progress building strong stable institutions Palestinian state providing Israel needed security. And development objectives often effectively secured diplomatic engagement. The impact Feed Future program Global Health Initiative turn part promotion policy reforms partner countries, Millennium Challenge Compacts part product sustained political engagement create positive conditions development. In many places, including Iraq Afghanistan, need mutually reinforcing diplomatic development strategies stems combined causes effects violent conflict, instability, weak states. The two "D"s QDDR reflect world see today — envision future. The review process relied wisdom talent exceptional people spheres — State USAID — worked tirelessly produce blueprint reforms implemented next four years whose impact stretch far beyond. This year's inaugural QDDR, repeated every four years, identifies new approaches skill sets diplomats development experts, sets budget priorities, establishes planning procedures, revises promotion incentives, reorganizes bureaucratic structures. It focuses three main areas: modernizing coordinating diplomacy across U.S. government agencies; ensuring development work creates lasting sustainable impact; creating stronger nexus diplomacy development — well better coordination defense partners — conflict zones fragile states. A GLOBAL CIVILIAN SERVICE Diplomacy long backbone U.S. foreign policy. And remains today. The vast majority work State Department consists deploying diplomats engaging diplomacy address major global regional challenges, confronting Iran's nuclear 2 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015 ambitions, facilitating negotiations Israelis Palestinians, enhancing stability Korean Peninsula, working governments bring emergency relief Haiti. And President Obama I certainly relied old-fashioned diplomatic elbow grease hammer last-minute accord Copenhagen conference climate change last December. In annual strategic dialogues range key partners — including Russia, India, China, South Africa, Nigeria, Indonesia, Pakistan — aim move beyond tyranny inbox deepen broaden relationships establish stronger foundation addressing shared problems, advancing shared interests, managing differences. We investing strengthening global structures like G-20 regional institutions Organization American States Association Southeast Asian Nations. This part commitment building new global architecture cooperation includes East West, also North South. While traditional diplomacy always critical advancing agenda, enough. We expand engagement reach influence wider diverse groups using new skills, strategies, tools. To end, broadening way conceive diplomacy well roles responsibilities practitioners. The original Foreign Service, name implies, consisted people trained manage relations foreign states, principally consultations counterparts government. This main function Ambassadors embassies, well staff State Department. But increasing global interconnectedness necessitates reaching beyond government citizens, broadening foreign policy portfolio include issues confined domestic sphere, economic environmental regulation, drugs disease, organized crime, worldwide hunger. As issues spill across borders, domestic agencies addressing must work overseas — operating embassies consulates. A U.S. Ambassador 2010 thus responsible managing civilians State USAID, also operating CEO multi-agency. And must also adept connecting audiences outside government, business community civil society. Consider embassy Islamabad. The mission includes 800 staff members; 450 diplomats civil servants State 100 USAID. A large portion work consists traditional diplomacy — foreign-service officers helping Americans traveling business region, issuing visas, engaging Pakistani civilian military counterparts. But Ambassador also leads civilians 11 federal agencies, including disaster relief reconstruction experts helping rebuild last summer's historic floods; specialists health, energy, communications, finance, agriculture, justice; military personnel working Pakistani military bolster Pakistani capacities partner fight violent extremists. Back Washington, responsibility Secretary ensure Foreign Civil Service personnel within State Department USAID working together -- colleagues across federal government. Our strategic dialogue Pakistan involves ten separate working groups thus brings together cabinet secretaries experts range agencies governments. Our dialogue India engaged 22 different agencies; 3 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015 Secretary Geithner I traveled Beijing May second round Strategic Economic Dialogue, delegation included civilians 30 agencies. Our Foreign Service officers, Civil Service personnel, local engaged staff State Department USAID form backbone global engagement. But need expertise skill civilians across government meet today's tomorrow's challenges. By drawing pool talent already exists federal agencies overseas posts, build global civilian service caliber flexibility military. From State Department, USAID, Millennium Challenge Corporation Overseas Private Investment Corporation, Export-Import Bank, Departments Justice, Treasury, Agriculture, Centers Disease Control, Peace Corps, many others, must reward teamwork, collaboration inter-agency rotations. Developing structures habits cooperation collaboration enable us take full advantage civilian assets. Engagement must go far beyond government-to-government interactions. In information age, public opinion takes added importance even authoritarian states non-state actors able influence current events. Today, U.S. ambassador creates ties host nation's government, also people The QDDR endorses new public diplomacy strategy makes public engagement every diplomat's duty, town halls media interviews, organized outreach, events provincial towns smaller communities, student exchange programs, virtual connections bring together citizens civic organizations. Indeed, 21' century, diplomat likely meet tribal elder rural village counterpart foreign ministry — likely wear cargo pants pin stripe suits. Public diplomacy must start top. In Indonesia Turkey, I conducted bilateral meetings government officials, I also met civil society leaders appeared guest popular television talk shows. I held town halls diverse groups citizens every continent I've visited. Public events like much part job Secretary State meetings Foreign Ministry durability partnerships depend attitudes people well policies governments. In Washington, too, re-shaping way conceive conduct public diplomacy. We shifting away traditional platforms building connections foreign publics regions considered beyond reach. It makes sense allocate greatest resources parts world ties already strong secure, minimize efforts places engaging public critical success. This also forces us streamline modernize public diplomacy efforts across board. When public diplomacy staff decreased embassy Berlin make resources available outreach Central Eastern Europe, staff used opportunity develop leaner, agile, effective operation. We also leverage civilian power connecting businesses, philanthropists citizens' groups partner governments perform tasks governments cannot. Technology particular gives us new tools engagement. One great success year partnership forged almost overnight U.S. Haitian mobile phone companies, Red Cross, social entrepreneurs, Coast Guard eventually U.S. Marines. Together, created platform directed text messages locating earthquake victims workers could rescue them. We 4 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015 launched program called Text Haiti drew contributions 31 million Americans donated $10 each.

One visit Russia, example, helped pave way public-private partnership called text4baby provide mobile application pregnant women new mothers get health tips cell phones monitor pregnancies determine seek professional medical attention. As look road forces shape global politics, see acutely material conditions people's lives affect national security objectives. While USAID colleagues lead development work overseas, State Department employees today Ambassadors civil service experts must better versed, engaged, development issues. For reason, I called broad review aid programs Afghanistan Pakistan ensure aligned strategic objectives, sent two experienced ambassadors serve overall foreign assistance coordinators Islamabad Kabul. This comprehensive approach essential engagement many regions. In Mexico, example, continue support law enforcement efforts arrest prosecute members drug cartels also begun next phase Merida Initiative working Mexican partners — government, business, civil society — strengthen justice systems promote "culture legality" communities. This includes supporting community watch initiatives, expanding educational opportunities young people alternatives drug trade, strengthening citizen participation councils every state Mexico ensure safely engage real dialogue hold authorities accountable. When diverse elements civilian power work cohesively — many embassies around world, best days Washington — see potential impact global civilian service. There guarantee comprehensive approach achieve every goal, especially places challenges entrenched complex places like Mexico Yemen Pakistan. But best alternative have, one must pursue. ACHIEVING HIGH IMPACT DEVELOPMENT I sometimes asked development matters foreign policy spend money people overseas economic challenges home. As counterintuitive may seem, answer development, done effectively, one best tools enhance stability prosperity. It help strengthen fragile failing states; support rise capable partners help us solve regional global problems; 5 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015 advance democracy human rights. And direct expression values compassion people. At time, must acknowledge that, world's problems vast, resources not. As stewards American taxpayer dollars, must strategic pursuing critical needs making decisions based hard evidence ensure investments deliver results. And must also stay focused long-term — simply addressing urgent needs people today building foundation prosperous future. With mind, Presidential Policy Directive Development issued President Obama September — first American President -- emphasizes importance targeting countries responsible governments favorable conditions, coordinating assistance trade, finance, investment credits economic policies help seed emerging markets foster widespread sustainable economic growth. Economic growth lasting route poverty, expanding strengthening middle classes around world key creating sustainable international order lies heart National Security Strategy. The QDDR embraces development process assisted self-help furtherance American interests values. A developing country must charge set goals meeting needs people. Americans come table partners, patrons, lending resources expertise and, eventually, putting business host country self-sustaining. Today, putting partnership model practice two signature initiatives Obama Administration announced past year: Global Health Initiative Feed The Future, part Obama Administration's broader global food security initiative. The Global Health Initiative recognizes landscape health many developing countries improved years, due part President George W. Bush's Presidential Emergency Plan AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), malaria initiative, contributions many countries organizations. But crowded landscape necessarily improve health outcomes efficiently long-term. Consider life woman remote African village. Within walking distance clinic supported PEPFAR, finds HIV receives antiretroviral drugs keep healthy. She make longer journey bicycle bus another clinic offering prenatal care immunizations. Sometimes health services come door, form health volunteers bringing bed nets protect family malaria. Yet trouble giving birth, nearest facility equipped perform emergency surgery hundreds miles away. And home sprayed mosquitoes, access clean water, children may escape malaria die diarrheal disease. The delivery health services marred lack coordination among countries organizations, including government. And governments cannot afford don't expertise ensure health care gets local populations, donor countries outside NGOs stepped in. That right response emergency, many places, become de facto solution. As result, African woman's access care 6 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015 piecemeal, future care uncertain. She vulnerable vicissitudes funding cycles development trends places far lives. The fundamental purpose Global Health Initiative address problems tying individual health programs -- PEPFAR, President's Malaria Initiative, maternal child health, family planning, neglected tropical diseases, critical health areas -- together integrated, coordinated, sustainable system care, countries lead. Our Feed The Future initiative based principles. To give one example partner country, Bangladesh developing food security investment plan based part consultations public forum 500 representatives. The strategy reviewed technical quality independent experts refined national leaders technical experts. We developing U.S. government investment plan support Bangladesh's strategy, full collaboration governments international donors. This partnership looks like practice. Partner governments almost certainly choose things differently might, outline different priorities. Vetting investing government's plan may take longer delivering services ourselves. But result promises sustainable strategy continue even assistance ended. This approach reflects consensus international community principles effective foreign assistance. The QDDR embraces principles recommends detailed set mechanisms implementing field. The QDDR also focuses diplomatic side effective development policy, building much stronger systematic links State USAID Washington field. Diplomacy support development policy different ways. Our important diplomatic effort China recent years -- Strategic Economic Dialogue — includes high-level discussions development, means countries' respective collective efforts Africa elsewhere. Before 2009 meeting G-8 L'Acquila, Italy, high- level engagement partner governments enabled us secure $20 billion international commitment food security, building coalition countries willing contribute. And 2009 Summit Americas, President Obama launched Energy Climate Partnership Americas, bringing together democratically-elected governments hemisphere work toward shared goal clean, renewable inexpensive energy sources. As part effort, United States Brazil helping seven energy-poor Central American Caribbean countries develop biofuels. This promotes sustainable economic development regional integration, also helps reduce dependence imported Venezuelan oil. But diplomacy development mutually reinforcing also get house order. The first step move beyond agency stove-piping use talent expertise within federal government. The Global Health Initiative, example, jointly led USAID Administrator, U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator, Director Centers Disease Control Prevention. Their agencies, along Departments Health Human Services, National Institutes Health, Peace Corps, work together 7 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015 overall guidance direction Deputy Secretary State. This unique leadership structure solidifies commitment coordination every level, White House down. The QDDR also reinforces reflects specific internal reforms within USAID. Administrator Rajiv Shah laid aggressive set operational priorities called "USAID Forward" designed make Agency effective, accountable transparent. Guided QDDR coordination State Department, USAID Forward concentrates procurement, people, policy. Procurement reform may sound like arcane subject removed realities helping people ground. Done poorly, procurement become bureaucratic burden. But also opportunity progress it's done well. Our goal build local capacities countries work drawing talent expertise small businesses NGOs. Senegal, instance, 1,400 health huts, trained USAID provide basic – often lifesaving – treatments, lowering costs moving us closer day aid longer necessary. To reform personnel, goal attract retain development professionals represent diversity America skilled, energetic, know solve problems. Administrator Shah I observed firsthand best USAID staff members work development entrepreneurs—identifying opportunities finding solutions meet people's needs. To capitalize kind talent, QDDR focusing recruit retain locally hired staff, backbone USAID missions worldwide. To reform policy, USAID already created new Bureau Policy, Planning Learning. Evidence-based development must notion—it must become reality. We measure investments number programs run, number children nourished vaccinated, volume people benefiting clean water, electricity, teachers, medicine jobs. We also make sure taxpayer dollars well spent – gathering baseline data, surveying development indicators launch projects, measuring indicators life project. Where approaches successful, replicate scale up. Where not, admit it, learn failures, come better idea. We also rely innovations science technology help us work better, cheaper, faster pursuit high impact development. Mobile phones already transformed lives countless people sub-Saharan Africa. Imagine world would look like off-grid renewable energy provided illumination billions people living dark, kinds drought-resistant seeds existed farmers developing world. The QDDR endorses USAID's creation Development Innovation Ventures Fund creative solutions funded, piloted brought scale. In July, USAID brought together scientists technology experts develop "Grand Challenges Development." These government-sponsored competitions challenge scientists engineers develop game-changing solutions specific development problems. Just recently, USAID funded trial vaginal microbicide reduces transmission HIV/AIDS 30 percent, major breakthrough HIV transmission give women control reproductive health. USAID Gates Foundation recently joined forces create 8 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015 mobile banking Haiti, building effective programs Asia, Latin America, Africa. We also inviting top scientists entrepreneurs help us find cost-effective, simple ways provide clean water, vaccines, inexpensive durable computers, micro-generators, medical kits, applications cell phones. As undertake efforts, broaden partnerships. Twenty years ago, "development community" didn't exist far beyond walls USAID. Today, includes corporate leaders, philanthropists, foundations advocates, add new skills perspectives. Equally important grassroots leaders communities: religious groups, students, activists lend passion energy humanitarian efforts. These advocates entrepreneurs willing challenge old orthodoxies bring new mindset work. We partner get results. BUILDING PEACE AND STRENGTHENING FRAGILE STATES American civilians long operated conflict zones fragile states. But today, diplomats development experts asked undertake missions scale scope never seen before. Our task Iraq lead broad U.S. peace-building mission. At time, responsible Afghanistan helping reduce strength insurgency, improve governance, promote stability last troops return home. In Pakistan, assisting government society buffeted global economic recession, natural disasters, regional instability, supporting counter-terrorism counter- insurgency campaign. Today, twenty percent diplomatic corps stationed three countries -- democracy young, institutions struggling serve local populations, society ethnically religiously divided, security ongoing challenge. Beyond countries, working stabilize fragile states Somalia Sudan Haiti Kyrgyzstan. Given unprecedented situation, ask unprecedented questions: As plan transition Iraq, protect embassy Baghdad consulate Basra? How ensure security reconstruction experts must work alongside Iraqi colleagues villages towns across country? How generate sustained manpower fulfill many ongoing diverse commitments Iraq? In Iraq, 170,000 troops surge: Today troops stand 50,000 assigned supporting Iraqi government forces. On ground 1,600 civilians — diplomats, stabilization reconstruction experts development professionals charge helping Iraq transition stable prosperous democracy. Similarly Afghanistan, American contribution reconstruction redevelopment led 1,100 diplomats civilian experts remain troops gone. These numbers say something important civilian power leadership. Properly trained equipped, civilians force- multipliers. One effective diplomat development expert leverage many ten local partners, learned local partners build capacities networks, communities become stronger resilient. 9 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015 Civilian leadership addressing conflict instability also depends marshaling leveraging varied assets government whole. Under leadership strong Ambassadors agency representatives, collaboration among American civilians across government reached new level Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti elsewhere. We pooling expertise civilians State USAID, well DoJ, Commerce, Treasury, DHS, HHS, CDC, agencies. The United States cannot succeed fragile states agencies aren't working together. That means organizing internally focus integration, cohesion, solving problems. For example, creation office Special Representative Afghanistan Pakistan — 16 agencies represented — innovation overcome agency compartmentalization achieve comprehensive strategy. The QDDR also draws talents Civilian Response Corps, identified hundreds civilian experts across government quickly deployed conflict zones fragile states. The Secretary sent CRC's expeditionary conflict security experts Southern Sudan, deploying quickly enough support Sudanese partners prepare potential independence decades conflict. The QDDR recommends building rapid response diplomatic teams specially trained experts operate effectively longer term amidst conflict instability. The State Department focus complex political crises, USAID disaster response, building abilities get relief recovery workers field within 24 hours disaster strikes. We also create joint operating framework response plan allow State USAID work effectively together agencies. Although Afghanistan Iraq occupied much world's attention past eight years, places diplomats development experts responsible helping shore fragile failing states, deal consequences political, economic, social instability, join common cause prevent conflicts first place. Indeed, since end Cold War, State Department USAID steadily taken missions difficult dangerous places, Lebanon Bosnia East Timor. In Sudan mounting civilian surge around southern capital Juba prepare January 2011 referendum determine whether South Sudan secedes North. In Yemen, embassy working address economic conditions ravages poverty country recently faced secessionist movement south, rebellion north, persistent threat al Qaeda Arabian Peninsula. Through diplomatic Friends Yemen concentrated efforts stabilize fragile local communities create opportunities economic growth, trying help Yemeni government provide better services citizens prevent conflict. The QDDR anticipates situations requiring rapidly deployable civilian teams diplomats, stabilization reconstruction experts, development professionals meet needs circumstances like Sudan Yemen also mounting larger efforts countries time. Training new generation diplomats, development professionals, peace-building experts help us strengthen weak, fragile violent states offer opportunities hope citizens. Poverty repression automatically engender terrorism countries impoverished, corrupt, lawless mired recurring cycle conflict prone 10 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015 becoming havens terrorists criminals. Al Qaeda first operated Sudan bombed U.S. embassies Kenya Tanzania migrating Afghanistan, country notable poverty, high infant mortality repressive Taliban government. It coincidence al Qaeda active today underdeveloped nations Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Mali, Mauritania Niger. Beyond terrorism violent extremism, world already witnessed many tragic examples happens good governance absent. We seen drug cartels exploit absence strong governing institutions push countries several continents brink becoming narco-states. Elsewhere, countries rich minerals diamonds become epicenters violence — including gender-based sexual violence -- central government unwilling unable combat corruption, regulate legitimate business, invest natural resources wealth country's infrastructure people. And often, conflicts fragile weak states spill borders, creating humanitarian crises spawning grounds terrorists global criminal networks elsewhere. On positive side, however, also seen effectiveness civilian power working military impede conflict contribute stability. In Liberia, fighting rebel groups government forces leadership Charles Taylor intensified humanitarian situation deteriorated, United States undertook intense diplomatic efforts, including public calls Taylor's resignation, well military deployments region help shore peacekeeping efforts Economic Community West African States (ECOWAS). Taylor's resignation paved way comprehensive peace agreement led end Liberia's conflict set stage Liberia's stabilization reconstruction efforts. Both United Nations United States continue partner Liberia rebuilds social economic infrastructure destroyed years conflict. Our future depends success types missions — Iraq Afghanistan West Africa -- ability mount them. The American people must understand spending taxpayer dollars diplomacy development interests, especially investments support missions conflict zones, fragile states, states play responsible role regions world. And Congress, long tradition bipartisan support traditional diplomacy development, must appreciate scale scope reconstruction stabilization missions civilians asked undertake. Congress must provide necessary funding now. The House Senate appropriated hundreds billions dollars military missions Iraq Afghanistan. The diplomatic development activities represent fraction cost, yet funding often gets bogged old debates foreign aid. We move beyond past treat diplomacy development national security priorities smart investments future stability security. We succeed, necessary Congressional leadership support. Perhaps one understands urgency much Secretary Gates. As said last August: "Congress part problem. When I sent budget Hill roughly $550 billion, Senate voted $550 billion budget allocation Hillary Clinton sent budget $50 billion, whacked four five billion dollars it. So 11 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015 change attitude recognition critical role agencies like State AID play . . . . play leading role I think need play situations." Our emphasis civilian power keeping America's history traditions. The Marshall Plan civilian development initiative undertaken partnership European governments. President Kennedy founded Peace Corps show world different face America decades term "soft power" coined. American diplomats helped negotiate reunification Europe 1991 without shot fired. Meanwhile, American civilians enjoyed world's admiration spirit innovation, abundant goodwill, audacious belief technological, social political advances must used improve lives human beings around world. The men women volunteer armed forces exemplify spirit. So growing number civilians find ways engage public service. With right balance civilian military power, advance America's interests values, lead support nations solving global problems, forge strong diplomatic development partnerships traditional allies newly emerging powers. And rise challenges world 21st century meet tests America's global leadership. ### 12 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015

By 2020 global mortality chronic disease claim 50 million lives compared 20 million communicable infectious disease currently mortality DEVELOPING WORLD 29 million people year chronic disease. 2. As know US, chronic disease care (usually end stage acute settings) accounts almost 80% health care expenditures. This likely increase globally developing countries countries like India diabetes rates 25%. Mortality heart disease China 35 44 year olds increased 300% last decades. 3. Global Funding prevention treatment causes chronic disease doesn't match disease burden unacceptable margin. 4. Less 5% funding governments, NGO's, private foundations chronic disease (i.e. World Bank - $4.5 billion health sector work, 2.5% non-communicable disease Global Fund focuses HIV/AIDS, malaria TB WHO spends $7.50 infectious disease $0.50 chronic disease, Gates Foundation: funding chronic disease). So here's I see solution We need movement create awareness, build messaging, fund comparative research innovative methods preventing treating chronic disease, develop changes medical education scale training providers effective prevention treatment chronic disease, build partnerships support demonstration projects initiatives, develop health information technology platforms support chronic disease prevention care integrated system disruptive technologies.

Feel free share whomever you'd like. I little idea larger context — many schools/kids looking at, one thing we've learned US last 5 years good teachers #1 lever change education. If got 1,000 really great teachers Port-au-Prince (w/ even modicum support materials), they'd make big difference touch lives 30,000-60,000 kids. I think totally doable, short-order, magnificent way could set foundation well-educated generation Haitians could lead country poverty, self-sustainability, self-governance openness.

In Vietnam, access popular social networking sites suddenly disappeared. And last Friday Egypt, 30 bloggers activists detained." Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Egypt -- grouping countries Chinese government, recent sense rise superpower status, used lumped with. Compared US financial power, OK; overtaking Japan economic size, yes; crucial player environmental negotiations... one thing. Bracketed sentence Tunisia Uzbekistan different.

Hello Coco,Thank kind words sorry late reply -- I've busy holiday season (also there's drop-off posts Iately),I wouldn't place extra emphasis Haji's arrest (or anyone Baran, matter). I think arrests geared intimidating Khatami anything. Although he's quiet either Mousavi Karoubi, "international clout," will, I believe regime less willing attack head-on. (Though witnessed Tasooa admittedly shocking). Actually, exceptions, I think threshold passed arrests aren't even strategic anymore. It seems vast majority sake intimidation. The regime looking increasingly desperate.Rafsanjani, I'm sure, something. He's good ally, I think pro-democracy movement always wary intentions. Ultimately, Rafsanjani looking Rafsanjani. Having said that, I think interests Greens continue coalesce. Before election, funding Mousavi's campaign (in hopes Mousavi's presidency would bring back fold rise "new right"). Now (and going forward), he's probably concerned legacy Iran. We remember driving force ascended Khamenei Supreme Leadership, also accusations 2005 election (where lost Ahmadinejad) fixed. Not simplify things, I'm sure resentment. Regardless, sooner later he's going bold give opposition something (namely momentum, July sermon) wants get something back (clout, legacy, etc.).Things continuing heat up!

"No es posible que Estados Unidos use una desgracia natural para invadir y ocupar militarmente Haiti", dijo Morales, quien califico de "inhumano, salvaje y oportunista" el despliegue de las fuerzas armadas estadounidenses en la isla caribefia. "Vamos pedir mediante la cancilleria las Naciones Unidas una reunion de emergencia para repudiar y rechazar esta ocupaciOn militar de Estados Unidos hacia Haiti", anuncio Morales. Morales recordo que el mandatario de Estados Unidos, Barack Obama, ha garantizado en foros internacionales que desea tener socios y relaciones diplomaticas de respeto mutuo con el resto de 'Daises. "Ser socios o tener relaciones diplomaticas se hace con ocupacion militar, ni con tropas militares, ni con bases militares", dijo y espera "un pronunciamiento de todos los pueblos del mundo y de las fuerzas sociales rechazando esta intervention y ocupaciOn militar en Haiti". Morales se preguntO tambien "cuanta plata, cuantos alimentos o cuanta agua" se van destinar para abastecer los 12.000 soldados que Estados Unidos ha mandado Haiti y considero que ese dinero "deberia gastarse en los damnificados" por el terremoto y en los militares. • Confio en que el propio pueblo estadounidense rechace "el use abusivo" de sus recursos econornicos para lo que insistio en calificar como "intervenciOn militar".

We willing allow diplomatic national security benefits development work accrue time. And willing engage missions purely altruistic reasons. These differences underscore development must independent partner diplomacy, merely servant. Reforming U.S. Foreign Assistance Reforming U.S. foreign assistance — substance architecture — priority Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Secretary Clinton stated: "I want USAID seen premier development agency UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773691 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773691 Date: 08/31/2015 world." I share sentiment. One basic questions respect foreign aid reform best strengthen capacity USAID run effective assistance programs. During last two decades, decision-makers made easy agency perform mission. Development resources declined precipitously 1990s reorganization initiatives resulted agency's loss evaluation, budget, policy capacity. There broad consensus among development experts loss functions USAID inhibiting success development programs. Our development efforts never effective agency houses development expertise cut relevant policy budget decisions. Events since 2001 spurred greater investments foreign assistance. But many resources located outside USAID. Roughly two dozen departments agencies taken aspects foreign assistance, including Department Defense Department Agriculture. The President advocated doubling foreign assistance time, announced new initiatives food security health. Given increased resources needed initiatives, crucial American people Congress confidence funds used efficiently. USAID must central role development policy decisions. If avoid inefficient experimentation, must capacity evaluate programs disseminate information best practices methods. That requires policy makers continue augmenting agency's staffing expertise. These principals reflected legislation Senator Kerry I introduced last year, S. 1524, Foreign Assistance Revitalization Accountability Act. The Administration initiated two separate studies — State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy Development Review National Security Council's Presidential Study Directive Development — attempt make recommendations development programs better support U.S. foreign policy objectives. The QDDR completed fall uncertain when, if, know outcomes PSD. I eager review Administration's ideas ready. But meantime, Congress offering ideas improve government's development capacity. The Kerry-Lugar foreign assistance reform bill product well year research analysis Senators staffs. It strong support aid community. And co-sponsored bipartisan group 23 Senators, twelve members Foreign Relations Committee. This level backing bill related foreign assistance extremely rare. It provides opportunity build something approaching consensus issue. I hopeful Executive Branch recognize bill co-sponsored majority Senate Foreign Relations Committee nearly quarter full Senate given substantial weight review process. A strong development agency serves foreign policy guidance Secretary State, envisioned bill, best empower advance U.S. goals. A Development Policy Guided Objectives UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773691 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773691 Date: 08/31/2015 Even reconsider development architecture, vital development policy guided objectives rather organize government deliver development assistance. We focus big issues — food scarcity, poverty, disease, environmental degradation -- prevent economic growth large swath world's countries. Those objectives require strategies reflect needs countries helping rather vagaries budget process, often allocates funds response lobbying pressures, media interest, political favoritism. Country strategies based broad objectives also give us best chance avoid dependence arbitrary spending targets specific sectors. For example, promoting food security requires investments agricultural productivity, clean water, infrastructure, basic higher education, land titling, name factors. The Global Food Security Act, I authored Senator Casey Senator Kerry co-sponsored, reflects principles. The food price crisis occurred 2008 resulted culmination policy choices donor recipient governments decades-long period. That crisis wakeup call development community, international donors, policymakers worldwide. Because achieving food security must multi-sector endeavor goes beyond simply raising crop yields, U.S. policy must seek integrate variety approaches actors. At time, want delegate responsibility food security policy multiple departments. That could weaken already fractured foreign assistance structure. That bill designates USAID, broad development experience necessary, lead agency implement strategy. "Whole-of-Government" Perspective The term "whole-of-government" come vogue policy circles. To extent term underscores complexity development problems need apply talents diverse set agencies solution, useful descriptive. Our government must capacity draw expertise achieve vital development missions without artificial barriers erected agencies. Many agencies working together successfully development problems many parts world. But mistake term "whole-of-government" organizational strategy. Even multiple agencies making contributions, someone must charge, someone must coordinate activities involved, someone must take responsibility inefficiencies failures. This especially important development context highly fragmented aid system. The risk term "whole-of-government," used justify fragmentation preserve roles agencies justified. We also must careful whole-of-government concept re-define development series technical decisions — dig wells seeds plant soils. Such redefinition would devalue discipline development, many practitioners spent lifetime studying testing. We know long experience technical expertise must grounded understanding development. For example, agricultural advancement depends much reaching women farmers, building agriculture education, engaging civil society support rural development seed quality planting decisions. An integrated strategy come agency understands development separate discipline, Dr. Shah said. UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773691 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773691 Date: 08/31/2015 I believe starting point future design assistance programs status quo, rather period well-functioning well-resourced aid agency. Even emphasize talents multiple agencies, strong aid agency design integrated country-specific strategies key success. Unity Purpose Instead accepting whole-of-government, organizational model, guiding narrative, I believe helpful way viewing development mission — "unity-of-purpose." We need unified around common purposes marshal appropriate level resources variety approaches. There situations call involvement multiple agencies direction one government entity. But, decision involve government actors driven purpose. Such clearly case Haiti. The U.S. government international actors unified purpose disaster response. That response involves coordination hundreds organizations rescue people provide basic elements needed survival. At point soon, mission evolve disaster response reconstruction development. We asking whether able maintain unity-of-purpose even purpose changes. The Lugar-Casey bill proposes unity-of-purpose around achieving global food security. Regardless situation, unity-of-purpose guide foreign assistance designed. I applaud Secretary Clinton adopting food security top priority. Her inter-agency team working diligently Global Food Security Hunger Initiative, Congress responsive appropriating funding. Many operational decisions yet made, particularly decisions relating coordination, I stand ready work Administration pass Lugar-Casey bill soon possible. I look forward achieving unity-of-purpose Congress Administration food security. These easy issues solve. I applaud tonight dedication development willingness work Congress Administration try rebuild assistance infrastructure. I would conclude quote Dr. Norman Borlaug, Nobel Laureate Father Green Revolution, whose optimism never flagged. He believed constant striving would eventually wear obstacles. He said, "I cannot emphasize strongly fact progress depends intelligent, integrated persistent effort government leaders, statesmen, tradesmen, scientists, educators communication agencies." That true today said 39 years ago, I invite everyone make contributions spirit. ### Caitlin Klevorick Office Counselor Department State UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773691 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773691 Date: 08/31/2015 KlevorickCB@state.gov 202.647.6115 blackberry) B6 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773691 Date: 08/31/2015

Development resources declined precipitously 1990s reorganization initiatives resulted agency's loss evaluation, budget, policy capacity. There broad consensus among development experts loss functions USAID inhibiting success development programs. Our development efforts never effective agency houses development expertise cut relevant policy budget decisions. Events since 2001 spurred greater investments foreign assistance. But many resources located outside USAID. Roughly two dozen departments agencies taken aspects foreign assistance, including Department Defense Department Agriculture. The President advocated doubling foreign assistance time, announced new initiatives food security health. Given increased resources needed initiatives, crucial American people Congress confidence funds used efficiently. USAID must central role development policy decisions. If avoid inefficient experimentation, must capacity evaluate programs disseminate information best practices methods. That requires policy makers continue augmenting agency's staffing expertise. These principals reflected legislation Senator Kerry I introduced last year, S. 1524, Foreign Assistance Revitalization Accountability Act. The Administration initiated two separate studies — State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy Development Review National Security Council's Presidential Study Directive Development — attempt make recommendations development programs better support U.S. foreign policy objectives. The QDDR completed fall uncertain when, if, know outcomes PSD. I eager review Administration's ideas ready. But meantime, Congress offering ideas improve government's development capacity. The Kerry-Lugar foreign assistance reform bill product well year research analysis Senators staffs. It strong support aid community. And co-sponsored bipartisan group 23 Senators, twelve members Foreign Relations Committee. This level backing bill related foreign assistance extremely rare. It provides opportunity build something approaching consensus issue. I hopeful Executive Branch recognize bill co-sponsored majority Senate Foreign Relations Committee nearly quarter full Senate given substantial weight review process. A strong development agency serves foreign policy guidance Secretary State, envisioned bill, best empower advance U.S. goals. A Development Policy Guided Objectives UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773693 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773693 Date: 08/31/2015 Even reconsider development architecture, vital development policy guided objectives rather organize government deliver development assistance. We focus big issues — food scarcity, poverty, disease, environmental degradation -- prevent economic growth large swath world's countries. Those objectives require strategies reflect needs countries helping rather vagaries budget process, often allocates funds response lobbying pressures, media interest, political favoritism. Country strategies based broad objectives also give us best chance avoid dependence arbitrary spending targets specific sectors. For example, promoting food security requires investments agricultural productivity, clean water, infrastructure, basic higher education, land titling, name factors. The Global Food Security Act, I authored Senator Casey Senator Kerry co-sponsored, reflects principles. The food price crisis occurred 2008 resulted culmination policy choices donor recipient governments decades-long period. That crisis wakeup call development community, international donors, policymakers worldwide. Because achieving food security must multi-sector endeavor goes beyond simply raising crop yields, U.S. policy must seek integrate variety approaches actors. At time, want delegate responsibility food security policy multiple departments. That could weaken already fractured foreign assistance structure. That bill designates USAID, broad development experience necessary, lead agency implement strategy. "Whole-of-Government" Perspective The term "whole-of-government" come vogue policy circles. To extent term underscores complexity development problems need apply talents diverse set agencies solution, useful descriptive. Our government must capacity draw expertise achieve vital development missions without artificial barriers erected agencies. Many agencies working together successfully development problems many parts world. But mistake term "whole-of-government" organizational strategy. Even multiple agencies making contributions, someone must charge, someone must coordinate activities involved, someone must take responsibility inefficiencies failures. This especially important development context highly fragmented aid system. The risk term "whole-of-government," used justify fragmentation preserve roles agencies justified. We also must careful whole-of-government concept re-define development series technical decisions — dig wells seeds plant soils. Such redefinition would devalue discipline development, many practitioners spent lifetime studying testing. We know long experience technical expertise must grounded understanding development. For example, agricultural advancement depends much reaching women farmers, building agriculture education, engaging civil society support rural development seed quality planting decisions. An integrated strategy come agency understands development separate discipline, Dr. Shah said.

Even emphasize talents multiple agencies, strong aid agency design integrated country-specific strategies key success. Unity Purpose Instead accepting whole-of-government, organizational model, guiding narrative, I believe helpful way viewing development mission — "unity-of-purpose." We need unified around common purposes marshal appropriate level resources variety approaches. There situations call involvement multiple agencies direction one government entity. But, decision involve government actors driven purpose. Such clearly case Haiti. The U.S. government international actors unified purpose disaster response. That response involves coordination hundreds organizations rescue people provide basic elements needed survival. At point soon, mission evolve disaster response reconstruction development. We asking whether able maintain unity-of-purpose even purpose changes. The Lugar-Casey bill proposes unity-of-purpose around achieving global food security. Regardless situation, unity-of-purpose guide foreign assistance designed. I applaud Secretary Clinton adopting food security top priority. Her inter-agency team working diligently Global Food Security Hunger Initiative, Congress responsive appropriating funding. Many operational decisions yet made, particularly decisions relating coordination, I stand ready work Administration pass Lugar-Casey bill soon possible. I look forward achieving unity-of-purpose Congress Administration food security. These easy issues solve. I applaud tonight dedication development willingness work Congress Administration try rebuild assistance infrastructure. I would conclude quote Dr. Norman Borlaug, Nobel Laureate Father Green Revolution, whose optimism never flagged. He believed constant striving would eventually wear obstacles. He said, "I cannot emphasize strongly fact progress depends intelligent, integrated persistent effort government leaders, statesmen, tradesmen, scientists, educators communication agencies." That true today said 39 years ago, I invite everyone make contributions spirit. ### Caitlin Klevorick Office Counselor UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773693 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773693 Date: 08/31/2015 Department State KlevorickCB@state.gov 202.647.6115 (blackberry) UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773693 Date: 08/31/2015

Penn To: H Sent: Thu Jan 21 09:56:56 2010 Subject: FW: Mark Penn's latest Huffington Post blog: "Stopping Republican Comeback (Déjà Vu All Over Again)" Great internet speech based excerpts I seen — terrific. Here's piece I yesterday. The Huffington Post January 20, 2010 Strategy Corner: Stopping Republican Comeback (Déjà Vu All Over Again) Once initially popular Democratic president tries pass healthcare reform, raise taxes wealthy expand domestic spending. And voters send sharp signal want chart centrist course. As Yogi Berra said "It's déjà vu again." President Clinton's wakeup call came 1994 mid-term elections -- Obama's came year earlier yesterday's special election Massachusetts. In response similar situation, President Clinton fundamentally changed everything -- team, policies, overall direction message administration. He moved center balanced budget, welfare reform, policies helped concerned moms raise kids, leaving behind divisive bitterness first two years. As part new team then, I saw President Clinton consciously took presidency back centrist message presidential campaign relentlessly pursued swing voters; didn't go small, went vital center -- 24 million jobs balanced budget big accomplishments. President Obama plenty time turn around facing kind losses President Clinton did. But stopping Republican machine done basis words alone -- take actions results calm electorate. It also won't done basis stepped populist rhetoric. You can't make deals Wall Street, Pharma, major interest groups turn around make whipping boy credibility. No doubt fight White House many inside wanting go back equivalent "people vs. powerful." Only voters see White House powerful lurch would probably harshest electoral consequences next November. But Obama turn around keep country moving steady path change makes kind significant changes direction President Clinton did. It's getting trappings Washington said were.

Then go major transparency government binge, seeking new ways bring people closer administration social networking online means. Make transparency action, theme. 2) Break health care components move step step. The problem health care one agrees solution bill longer lives, greater access greater efficiency people want. Break start easy stuff like electronic medical records first work harder parts year year. 3) Look ways genuinely bi-partisan instead seeking 60th vote deals compromise. Genuine bi-partisanship would given Republicans malpractice reform exchange public option -- don't invest opposition outcome, reason support it. Just looking one vote exercise deal making compromise live post-partisan promise. Obama's got call Republican leaders sit them, push away. 4) Put jobs front center -- failure earlier root discontent. The administration hit 10 per cent tripwire unemployment numbers center country dismal -- far worse Massachusetts. This means moving country forward new economic world, trying take backwards. Raising taxes another flash point much administration's support came upper income voters turned right wing, anti-intellectual campaigns Republicans. People need know strategy competing winning emerging global, high tech economy. 5) Don't afraid think small stuff -- helping people daily lives. Helping people deal new stresses modern life -- texting road many working well past 65 -- small thing. People afraid big, grandiose plans fear bankrupt country need see government also relating daily lives manageable, concrete ways. It's kind daily activism Democrats uniquely bring White House. This got part strategy returns us lower unemployment, lower deficits, restrained spending. There plenty time push back Republicans get heady. That day come Newt Gingrich shut government backfired. But right Republicans issue -- issue whether administration gone Washington whether reclaim centrist, people-oriented mantle brought town. And means taking administration back vital center fulfilling core promises -- greater transparency, less political posturing, true bi-partisanship, extreme focus jobs economy, government demonstrates daily really cares people.

Under circumstances, Kingdom Saudi Arabia would important. It era Americans war ever peoples Islamic world, depend ever greater amounts imported energy, need ever larger foreign loans run government sustain life style. Yet Saudi Arabia little known. It society planet penetrated Western colonialism. No European armies breached borders; missionaries; merchants. Its capital, Riyadh, long limits infidels; holy cities Mecca Medina remain today. When Westerners finally came Saudi Arabia, came vindicators presumed cultural superiority, hired help. As result, say Saudis secretly see world's peoples divided two basic categories: (1) fellow Saudis; (2) potential employees. Be may, foreigners, Western, Asian, Arab, lived Saudi Arabia see strange place — one easy understand remains odds many values non-Saudis profess. The Kingdom long stood apart global norms. Its system government draws tribal Islamic traditions rather Western models: Its king presides rather rules royal family Saudi society. His responsibility less make decisions shape proclaim consensus, assuring share national wealth all, especially least privileged. Saudi Arabia levies taxes citizens, religious tithe known "zakat" — two-and-a-half percent annual donation private capital charity public purposes. All Saudis enjoy free education medical care birth death pursue services home abroad, wish. The Kingdom parliament, though elaborate informal mechanisms consultation citizens policy matters. Saudi Arabia reverses thereby affirms basic principle American political philosophy. "No representation without taxation." Unlike countries Arab Gulf, Saudi Arabia invested oil wealth home, abroad, though long generous foreign aid. (At one point donating six percent GDP other, mostly Muslim, nations.) The desperate poverty pre-oil period now, most, dim memory. Over lifetime elderly Saudis, Kingdom's per capita income risen one hundred fold. Sparsely populated mud-walled villages grown huge air-conditioned cities 21st Century architecture. Today, Saudis literate; many university degrees.

Now late eighties throne since 2005, surprised everyone vigor efforts modernize Saudi society reshape relationships world beyond borders. Saudi Arabia plenty problems keep king engaged. A lot issues derive peculiar religious heritage Saudi state. The current Kingdom Saudi Arabia (now century old) third political structure ally House Sa‘ud family eighteenth century religious reformer Shaykh al Islam Mohammed ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab Al-Tamimi. Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's writings form doctrinal basis so-called Wahhabism, notoriously intolerant socially conservative form Islam often confused reactionary religious traditions like Taliban. Saudi history involved sustained effort Kingdom's rulers persuade religious scholars puritanical followers embrace change open outside world. This struggle mainly peaceful virtually invisible outsiders. Sometimes, however, engendered violence. In 1975, example, late King Faisal paid life instituting public education girls introducing television nation. Both regent (from 1996 2005) recently ruler, King Abdullah careful avoid drama promotion change truly startling review cumulative results leadership. Take women's issues, example. In 2002, responsibility girls' education transferred religious authorities ministry education. Women make 58 percent enrollment Saudi universities. The new Princess Noura bint Abdulrahman University Women, currently construction Riyadh, enroll 40,000 students fall. Female participation labor force rising rapidly. Twenty-nine percent women work outside home. (That low figure compared represents remarkable advance Kingdom.) One-third civil service positions reserved women. The first woman took seat Council Ministers last year. After bit kerfuffie, Kingdom's religious scholars finally endorsed coeducation new King Abdullah University Science Technology. That big blow legitimacy gender apartheid. A Saudi friend I betting long women Kingdom drive. We plan clean building separate road system may require. (That's joke, hope.) A word abciut vision embodied King Abdullah University Science Technology. F6unded king last September initial endowment ten billion dollars, KAUST international, graduate-level research university.

On one level, leading element effort prepare Kingdom knowledge-based economy complement eventually supercede current reliance energy exports. But another level, powerful answer religious zealotry terrorist movements like al Qa'ida espouse. Let explain. There broad consensus among world's 1.6 billion Muslims modern age ethically corrupt religious faith needs reinvigoration renewal. Much like early Christian Protestants, many believe way achieve rediscover reaffirm values religion's earliest times. When inaugurated KAUST, King Abdullah explained envisaged reborn Bayt al-Hikma "House Wisdom." The original "House Wisdom" founded Baghdad around 760 C.E., second century Muslim era.

KAUST much instrument religious renaissance answer extremism academic institution. This brings issue religious tolerance. In 2003, King Abdullah inaugurated called "national forum intellectual dialogue." This ongoing national dialogue unprecedented acceptance religious diversity Kingdom. It marks end longstanding official discrimination Shiite minority. In 2007, King Abdullah made historic call Pope Vatican, first time Muslim leader stature done so. In 2008 organized two unprecedented international interfaith conferences Muslims, Jews, Christians, Buddhists, others Madrid New York. He intends dialogue, too, continuing process. There major domestic reform initiatives progress, like complete revamping Saudi educational system curriculum, experiments elections lower levels government civil society, efforts shift Kingdom toward reliance alternative sources energy, development huge new petrochemical industry complement production energy primary form. Time permit describe developments. My point simply great deal going Saudi Arabia press pundits seem realize. That said, everything is, course, relative. Sadly, many Saudis, history nation suggests religiously uptight are, oil comes ground. The Kingdom continues many ways belie God's admonition Holy Quran "there compulsion religion." The open practice religions Islam remains banned. The status role women Saudi society controversial far settled. Despite efforts "Saudiization," foreign workers continue dominate employment market, demanding premium compensate discomfort stress Saudi Arabia's religiously sanctioned mores impose them. Methods political consultation worked cohesive less populous Saudi Arabia longer produce consensus. The fiscal basis state continues oil exports, oil commodity whose price fluctuates unpredictably. There is, words, long list problems Saudis work coming years. Let turn briefly Saudi Arabia's foreign relations reviewing state country's interaction it. In foreign even domestic affairs, King Abdullah's impact little short revolutionary. He overseen negotiated settlement Kingdom's long-disputed borders neighbors. He brought Saudi Arabia World Trade Organization, ensuring trade investment activities first time follow internationally agreed rules. In 1982, Beirut, led Arab League historic reversal policy toward Israel- Palestine issue. Saudi Arabia long insisted would last state region recognize establish relations Israel. At Beirut, King Abdullah committed first normalize relations Israel upon achievement mutually acceptable arrangement coexistence Palestinians. He persuaded Arab countries promise would same. To great frustration, Israel respond. Since then, hope two-state solution could gain acceptance Israel region dimmed. Many Saudi Arabia's foreign policy challenges stem recent American policies region. These policies effect liberating Israel constraints settlement activities belligerent intervention Arab neighbors, installing Iran dominant political influence Iraq Lebanon, consolidating rather eroding Syrian-Iranian alliance, pushing Hamas arms Iranians, raising regional tensions Tehran's nuclear program nothing effective it.

At meeting, groups decided form two nonprofit entities promote reform efforts, Healthy Economy Now Americans Stable Quality Care, would almost entirely funded PhRMA <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1009/28362.html> . The two groups spent $24 million advertising campaigns; contract produce place ads went White House Senior Advisor David Axelrod's former firm <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0809/26240.html> , AKPD, owed Axelrod $2 million. In next month, CEO's pharmaceutical companies would meet Baucus administration officials least four times. These talks preceded major public event White House, one critical strategy promote health care reform.

The next day, Healthy Economy Now's PhRMA funded ad campaign ran first advertisement <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v. --n0KuoAV6ytO> support health care reform process calling government finally "fix" nation's health care cost problems. While many elements $2 trillion cost cutting pledge fell apart, drug industry remained committed process hopes could ultimately win defeat provisions feared closed-door meetings White House. The first occurred June 2. White House visitor logs show PhRMA's top executives, including Tauzin, industry CEOs met Sarah Fenn White House Office Health Care Reform. On day, publicly available schedule Senator Max Baucus shows Tauzin industry CEOs met Senate Finance Committee chairman. What ultimately resulted coordinated meetings would revealed Baucus June 20. In press release <http://finance.senate.gov/press/Bpress/2009press/prb062009.pdf> featuring statement Tauzin, Baucus revealed pharmaceutical industry accepted $80 billion cost cutting measures included Senate Finance Committee version bill. According news reports <http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=BD18F267-18FE-70B2-A8F5960026D227DF> , Baucus initially proposed $100 billion cost cutting measures, executives lobbyists meeting June 2 able win lower figure. The terms initial cost-cutting deal included $30 billion go directly towards closing "donut hole" Medicare prescription drug coverage. The "donut hole" term gap coverage occurs within Medicare prescription drug coverage.

The amount proposed deal, 50 percent coverage drugs within coverage gap, however, would completely close "donut hole." In Baucus' press release, Tauzin quoted saying, This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and, working together, make hope better tomorrow reality today." This "once-in-a-lifetime" opportunity also extended pharmaceutical industry's ability blunt long-term Democratic agenda lowering prescription drug prices Medicare negotiations, re-importation quicker release generics onto market. After making grand statement support cost cutting proposals time pharmaceutical industry finally force White House Democrats take certain chips table. Baucus proceeded plan convene bipartisan group <http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/28/us/politics/28baucus.html> effort craft bill desired White House. These participants included Democrats Kent Conrad Jeff Bingaman Republicans Chuck Grassley, Mike Enzi Olympia Snowe.

Soon after, PhRMA's big guns industry lobbyists paid White House another visit July 7 time met Rahm Emanuel Jim Messina (Baucus' chief staff Jon Selib also listed White House visitor logs meeting). In August, The Huffington Post's <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/13/internal-memo-confirms- bi_n_258285.html> Ryan Grim reported internal memo drafted meeting outlined policies would allowed final version health care reform. These included Medicare prescription drug negotiations, drug re-importation, lowering prices drugs available Medicare Part D Part B. The deal would $80 billion cost cutting absolutely more. *** While $80 billion deal cut Baucus' committee, congressional committees continued mark-up versions health care reform without knowledge White House relying Baucus produce final product. In House Representatives, House Energy & Commerce Committee leveled direct threat $80 billion deal. Energy & Commerce Chair Henry Waxman sought include provisions PhRMA gotten White House Baucus cut reform bill. These included drug reimportation, Medicare negotiating power speedier release generics market. According previous analysis measures proposed committee, measures would totaled hundreds billions cost cuts, far exceeding $80 billion cap agreed White House, Baucus PhRMA. The cost cutting measures passed Energy & Commerce bill spooked board PhRMA, included CEOs involved deal-cutting meetings White House Baucus. The board pressured Tauzin go public deal ensure White House would recognize renege. On August 4, Los Angeles Times <http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/04/nation/na-healthcare-pharma4> , exclusive report, featured quotes Tauzin claiming deal White House PhRMA existed that, Tauzin put it, "The White House blessed it." Tom Hamburger wrote article, "For part, Tauzin said received White House pledge forswear Medicare drug price bargaining, also separate promise pursue another proposal Obama supported campaign: importing cheaper drugs Canada Europe." The White House's Jim Messina later confirmed Tauzin's claim, stating, "The president encouraged approach ... He wanted bring parties table discuss health insurance reform." Democratic lawmakers furious. Rep. Raul Grijalva, chairman Progressive Caucus, asked <http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/health/policy/06insure.html> , "Are industry groups going ones table get first big piece pie fight crust?" *** On September 7, Baucus' bill made private circulation Hill; pharmaceutical industry cost-cutting exceed $80 billion.

On September 16, Baucus released full text legislation <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/16/health-care-bill-baucus-s_n_288218.html> public. The White House, PhRMA Baucus still fight battles keep deal intact. The key amendment targeting PhRMA deal committee mark-up came Sen.

Nelson claimed amendment would generate $106 billion revenue <http://www.politico.com/livepulse/0909/Nelson_PhRMA_amendment_fails.html> , PhRMA's perspective increase cost-cutting $186 billion. That would unacceptable PhRMA, Baucus, White House pharmaceutical industry made deal. Other Senate Democrats, Tom Carper Robert Menendez voted Republicans Baucus committee defeat amendment <http://www.washingtontimes.comfnews/2009/sep/24/panel-fails-overturn-white-house-deal-drugmakers/> . It little surprise Carper's Delaware home AstraZeneca Menendez' New Jersey home Merck Bristol-Myers- Squibb, lobbied $80 billion cap. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid introduced final bill, cap place, November 19. Debate began Dec. 3, come one attempt members change terms deal. Senator Byron Dorgan introduced amendment would allow drug re-importation, date voting drew near, Federal Drug Administration (FDA) released letter <http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/71307-fda-opposes-senate-drug- importation-amendmen> objecting proposal echoed pharmaceutical industry talking points: "...as currently written, resulting structure would logistically challenging implement resource intensive. In addition, significant safety concerns." Dorgan's amendment defeated <http://www.politico.com/livepulse/1209/BREAKING_Senate_rejects_Dorgan_amendment.html> numerous Democrats previously support reimportation switching "no" votes. On Christmas Eve, bill passed Senate PhRMA deal fully intact. *** New Year's Eve passed action health care reform. Public opinion regarding health care reform bill slipping throughout 2009. It reached fulcrum special election replace deceased senator Ted Kennedy Massachusetts January 19, 2010. Newly minted senator Scott Brown campaigned would senator provide Republicans votes filibuster final health care reform bill. Democrats ran cover. Despite largest majorities party since 1970s, Democrats put brakes agenda, particularly health care reform. In end, pharmaceutical industry's support health care reform would left air . After spending $100 million advertising support legislation Tauzin key executives hoped would windfall pharmaceutical industry, legislative process flat-lined.

Leslie H. Gelb must reassign Rahm, dump Larry Summers, get rid National Security adviser Jim Jones. The negative, even dismissive, talk Obama White House reached critical point. The president must change key personnel now. Unless speedily sets new team, reduced speechmaker. It's mostly matter relocating Chicago campaign crowd surround Oval Office inserting people proven records getting things done Washington world. To fair, it's clear whether bad judgments priorities, practicalities, steadiness come Mr. Obama White House team. Maybe overpowers discussions, maybe gives role policymaking far beyond experience realm. Unless you're there, don't know. But Mr. Obama president, except right-wing crazies, Americans still recognize great talents promise. It who's got helped. So who've got go. It who's got helped. So who've got go. One may quarrel sense urgency here. But it's hard conversation opinion leaders anywhere— especially Washington—that doesn't descend ripping Obama's White House team. The refrain complaints always same: • Obama forever taking strong stances backfill trim. Most recently, said "begrudge" Wall Streeters big earnings part market system. This, face saying couple weeks ago big bonuses "shameful." • Obama doesn't know what's really going on. Regarding Middle East, recently said "I think absolutely true year didn't produce kind breakthrough wanted, anticipated political problems sides earlier, might raised expectations high." He totally realize Palestinians Israelis nowhere close sitting dealing. • Obama wants get along everyone badly doesn't recognize real opposition sees it—let alone know deal it. He emerges meeting congressional Republican leaders health-care reform says "an eternal optimist"—when Republican leaders told press don't see common ground believe administration "scrap bill start over." • It's even hard follow latest Afghan policy. He calls Afghanistan "war necessity" orders 30,000 new troops there, coupled announcement he'll begin withdrawing year plus, see advisers say start withdrawals say won't.

And last week The Financial Times, Edward Luce provided <http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b6b4700a-10fb-lldf-9a9e-00144feab49a.html> thunderclap Washington's negative consensus incompetence Obama's Chicago-laden team. Luce named names White House, number journalists bloggers strikingly failed link Luce story. They said fear wrath Chicagoans. Steve Clemons, author The Washington Note, essentially endorsed <http://www.thewashingtonnote.com/archives/2010/02/core_chicago_teh Luce finding slapped fellow bloggers' wrists hiding issue. The situation serious Carter administration. There, two capable political campaigners—Hamilton Jordan Jody Powell—moved critical White House positions without knowing much business Washington. And were, quite naturally, busy learn. They also added "them" versus "us" (Washington insiders bureaucrats versus regular guys Georgia) mentality plagues administrations. The Chicagoans others "guarding" president create "us versus them" world. It's hard imagine policy conversation president Chicago crowd, since none them, except Rahm Emanuel, Washington policy experience. And isn't much evidence bring strong-minded outsiders challenge president regular basis either. The result inexperienced president advised inexperienced team. Here personnel changes bruited political policy circles: First, remove Rahm Emanuel chief staff move senior political adviser slot. No one I've talked believes management skills discipline run White House. But terrific political mind fighter given new job time thing. Proven pros could step right include following: Erskine Bowles, president University North Carolina former Clinton chief staff; Leon Panetta, CIA director formerly White House chief well Clinton; Sylvia Mathews, former deputy chief staff also Clinton; John Podesta, another former Clinton chief heads Center American Progress. All four tough know manage. Replace Lawrence Summers, director White House's National Economic Council, Paul Volcker, former chairman Federal Reserve. Summers brilliant highly controversial; he's beaten said want anyway. Volcker unmatched stature, practical experience, courage lion. He one position get step-by-step brass tacks economy stop Mr. Obama's weekly gyrations. Others proven track records help inside outside advisers are: Stephen Robert, formerly head Oppenheimer, Vincent Mai, former leader AEA Investors, Tom Hill Blackstone. There also two economic stars Washington who'd improve policymaking public combat: Sheila Bair, chairwoman Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Elizabeth Warren, chair Congressional Oversight Panel. One outside adviser would help president see economic hard choices ahead: Peter G. Peterson, accomplished businessman policy head. David Axelrod, senior political adviser president, needs concentrate next presidential campaign, wherein expertise lies, domestic foreign policy, another smart unknowledgeable voice. Good replacements know politics Washington would aforementioned Podesta; Tom Daschle, former Democratic Senate Majority Leader. As David Plouffe, another senior campaign aide, unofficial residence White House, lodged nearby Executive Office Building. Senior adviser Chicago buddy Valerie Jarrett much part inner circle move, given limited role making policy. Mr. Obama's crowd appears think getting things done means giving another speech. It's nice, nearly enough. Robert Gibbs needs rest press secretary. Let's put way: He wasn't born daily jousts pithy Republicans. His job calls memorable pointed phrases attacks, circle-the-wagon circumlocutions. Possible successors? Try Doyle McManus L.A. Times, Jake Tapper ABC News, Helene Cooper The New York Times. Last least, James Jones, National Security Adviser, move on. The career Marine greatly admired respected Commandant Corps NATO's military chief. He handled duties great skill. But wide acclamation inside outside White House, emerged strategist—perhaps key requirement key position. The person job pull everything together—laying achievable objectives precise plans dispense carefully packaged carrots sticks. One Democrat could step now, despite age, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's national-security adviser. He first-rate strategic mind—a rare quality—and knows deliver results. Obama need iron Zbig's lack sympathy toward Israel Russia.

They possess necessary energy, experience rare skill delivering results. They also shovel-ready. As critical bonus, could would mentor next generation down, talented one indeed, succeed two three years. To lead America world, Obama grow far beyond present propensity treat problems intellectual puzzles—to collect facts hear arguments. The great tasks governing demand proven intuition sensing what's achievable, buttons push when, buy time power take hold, make adjustments without flagrantly foolish rhetoric, avoid failures diminish power, succeed small well large ways. With team versed arts skills, President Obama America would succeed. Leslie H.

He works closely army officers ensure military's plans implement projects fit wider, albeit still embryonic, attempts bolster Jabar. The trio's schemes seem like pin-pricks set implacable valley below. So far, progress largely confined Jabar's office. Since arriving late last year, Melton Harris renovated district centre, installing air conditioners, curtains carpets. Jabar, rarely ventured office home Kandahar changes, turns almost every day, driving 30-minute commute battered white Toyota Corolla saloon three police bodyguards, -constantly wary risk ambush. "Getting building easy," says Harich. "Getting governor come work little harder."

They come apply government identity cards attend weekly council — shura — discuss projects planned Melton. "The fact they're even discussing stuff mind-boggling," says.

"I don't trust people, I don't go much," says. "They may try shoot me." Vehicles night patrol It tempting measure progress west's war Afghanistan terms damage Taliban — whether capturing movement's leaders driving back fighters battlefield. Last month, headlines dominated arrest Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar <http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f4f14de4-1b09-11df-88fa- 00144feab49a.html> , Taliban's second-in-command, big Nato offensive town Marjah <http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c8d82998:1411-11df-8847-00144feab49a.html> . But even Mullah Baradars arrested, military pushes launched, Taliban may simply bide time exploiting alienation corrupt absent government. The way stop undertake painstaking work stitching together government capable providing security services "shadow governments" set insurgents. Western countries talking years, course, building governance Afghanistan, men Melton Harich represent renewed commitment. US officials say 900 US civilian officers active Afghanistan, compared 300 start 2009, 50 destined Kandahar province. The hope team deliver one-two punch long seemed elusive exploiting military victories nurture functioning local government. "We fix governance nominal way victory won't stick," says senior US official. But sheer scale task Arghandab alone reveals enormity challenge.

(Arghandab witnessed heavy fighting: Russians mounted month-long siege never took valley.) Although governors Afghanistan's 34 provinces power — theory — nominate district governors, US intelligence officers say Jabar owes pre-eminence backing Karimullah, young leader Alakozai, ethnic Pashtun sub-tribe dominant valley. Said Amir Mohammad Agha, whose refusal recognise Jabar's authority keeps valley divided Divisions clans mean Jabar means consensus candidate. In particular, Said Amir Mohammad Agha <http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/54cf9eca-10e5-11df-9a9e-00144feab49a.html> , single-most influential man west side river, resents him. US officers say Agha detained Guantanamo Bay suspected Taliban commander. As long Agha refuses recognise Jabar's authority, valley remain divided. Even east side, frustration Melton Harich, Jabar yet prove garner much legitimacy. Locals milling around office mutter accusations skims salaries district officials turn work steers US reconstruction contracts towards friends. "He's good man, wants money bribes," said one, reflecting comments several visitors. Jabar vigorously denies allegations — indeed, linked one pistol-waving incident meeting Americans. Yet behaviour would unusual Afghanistan, bribery lubricates patronage-based system Karzai past leaders used hold ethnically diverse country together. The dilemma runs entire project Afghanistan. Western officials want impose template efficient administration, little choice work leaders rely traditional system survive. In Kandahar, dilemma acute. Afghanistan's centralised system means Jabar dependent provincial government based city send officers fill largely empty building, materialised. Indeed, Alakozai elders believe rivals Karzai's Popalzai tribe exploiting official positions Kandahar accumulate political economic influence expense. There deeper tension. US officials often speak putting "Afghan face" work. They want make seem local leaders behind improvements bolster standing eyes people. Yet talk appearances tacit recognition enterprise is, extent, founded creating illusion Afghan government work, hope real administration rapidly follow. Can approach succeed?

Since Greek debt held abroad, roughly 80 percent budget savings Greek government makes go straight Germans, French foreign debt holders (mostly banks). If growth turns poorly, Greeks prepared ever-tougher austerity pay Germans? Even everything goes well, Greek citizens seem unlikely welcome version "new normal."

Once euro fallen great deal, announce European Central Bank support euro levels (i.e., prevent appreciation, G-20 tacit agreement), also support peripheral euro zone nations viewed solvent buying bonds whenever markets chaotic.

It denies sinister intention (see article <http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15833035> ). And ears, OIC's effort sounds like harmless UN-speak, nothing more. (The United States Commission International Religious Freedom, congressionally mandated body, noted logical flaw: defamation means harming reputation living person entity: implies one can't defame idea religious founder longer, least physically, alive earth.) But critics OIC campaign, include atheists, Christians indeed Muslims, say "defamation" idea worse hot air: far protecting human rights, emboldens countries use blasphemy laws criminalise dissent. What encourages critics countries seem coming around view. Mexico, Uruguay, Argentina, Zambia South Korea voted latest resolution. Brazil criticised text abstained.

Meanwhile Christian-inspired NGO, European Centre Law Justice, denouncing abuse blasphemy laws many OIC member states. How fair point? It easy case make, example, Pakistan. Some 41 complaints blasphemy registered police Pakistan last year, says country's independent Human Rights Commission. In theory, blasphemy punishable death—a penalty handed never carried out. Worst-hit law minorities like Christians Ahmadis, group whose claim Muslim rejected Pakistani state. Although abuse law less rife 1980s, Islamist general tightened rules, law still invoked disputes (over property, say) nothing faith. "The vulnerable people, religious minorities, continue charged blasphemy," said All Dayan Hasan, researcher Human Rights Watch, campaign group. "But people convicted? No. Rarely.

"What saying?" Pat asked young Pashto-speaking interpreter. "They telling go back country ask people abandon them. The women Afghanistan don't want leave. They quite literally die Taliban return," said. In recent question-and-answer period one universities, Brigham Young, student asked Gen. David Petraeus whether anyone thought ask women Afghanistan felt U.S. hopes incorporate "reformed" Taliban governance structures Americans leave. Carefully avoiding word "women," general assured questioning student "moderate" Taliban would eligible rehabilitation. Left unaddressed definition "moderate," clearly depends sit: If sit burqa, thing "moderate" Taliban. Petraeus might find easy sidestep question happen Afghanistan's women "moderate" Taliban come back, it's likely haunt long time. Without security women security -- we've done protect it, moral practical obligation stay Afghanistan. In 2001, George W.

A months invasion, 2002 State Union address, Bush announced <http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/01/29/bush.speech.txt/> , "The last time met chamber, mothers daughters Afghanistan captives homes, forbidden working going school.

Since then, especially since last year's Afghan election, fine words sitting president disappeared. Many fine actions gone, too. Push local shuras including women 2002? Yes. Push local shuras including women 2010? Forget it. It's difficult understand why. Afghanistan crisis. The cynical policies characterized early mid-stages occupation come home roost. President Hamid Karzai rogue's gallery kleptocrats, human rights abusers, drug lords hanging onto power even Karzai declares open season United Nations accusing senior bureaucrats organizing widespread voter fraud consolidated hold power. In meantime, women taken back seat realpolitik exigencies coalition exit strategy. But suffering real, Afghanistan's poverty chaos affect women possibly all. Maternal mortality Afghanistan still makes world's top three list, nine years U.S. invasion, resulting life expectancy women 46. In countryside, Taliban zealots spray acid girls' faces going school -- 27 percent first place. According recent survey U.N. Development Fund Women, 87 percent Afghan women report beaten regular basis. In July last year, U.N. Assistance Mission Afghanistan (UNAMA) issued report <http://unama.unmissions.org/Portals/UNAMA/vaw-english.pdf> represents stinging official condemnation Karzai administration's abysmal track record women date. The report concluded, "The current reality ... women denied fundamental human rights risk violence course seeking justice crimes perpetrated them." Last year Karzai pardoned well-connected political thugs -- witnesses -- gang-raped woman bayonet. Her husband, battled redress, assassinated soon thereafter. Women dare speak widespread trampling rights face almost certain death <http://www.hrw.oreen/reports/2009/12/03/we-have-promises-world-O> murderers face 100 percent impunity. For warlords mujahideen make upper echelons Karzai government, issue gender equality always unwanted appendage U.S. involvement -- one could easily dispensed deployment flowery speeches token appointment lone female minister Ministry Women's Affairs. Indeed, recent "election," Karzai felt secure enough sign law series repressive measures designed repeal minimal gains women made since Taliban ouster. Although eventually forced back legislation allows Shiite husbands rape wives, Karzai successfully signed law legislation denies severely limits women's rights inherit, divorce, guardianship children. The Shiite Personal Status Law <http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/04/14/afghanistan-new-law-threatens-women-s-freedom> also legalizes forced marriage rape minors. It allows men exert almost total control female relatives offers power prohibit women's access work, education, health care denying right leave homes except "legitimate" purposes. Even Karzai's wife -- doctor whose skills desperately needed -- strictly sequestered. And sounds bad, wait Americans leave. This women. Gender inequality affects girls women, boys men. In Afghanistan, women rarely able leave house, young boys often forced carry unwarranted amount financial responsibility, something limits prospects well. Nor even Afghanistan. As Secretary State Hillary Clinton said <http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/03/138320.htm> March, "The subjugation women threat national security United States." On geopolitical level, Valerie's research found states higher levels violence women also less peaceful internationally. Indeed, violence women better predictor bellicosity level democracy, level wealth, presence Islamic civilization. In 2010 study, Valerie, along Brad Thayer, also found high levels gender inequality strong aggravating factor development Islamic suicide terrorism.

One reason fallacious notion, common among coalition members, Afghan "culture" allow gender equality forcing issue undermine Western interests. Pat heard openly one coalition representative, prefers remain anonymous: "There point pushing gender equality. It alienate [Afghans]." Of course, "them" refers men. But decision-makers forget culture fixed, highly mutable dynamic. More 30 years ago, Afghan women attending universities, teaching, working doctors, nurses, professors. Far black hole gender apartheid, Afghanistan, though impoverished, progressive many Muslim neighbors. Furthermore, many young Afghans open new ways things. In 2009, hundreds Afghan men women bravely stood together Kabul protest Karzai's support new oppressive Shiite family law. If Americans assume Afghan men Neanderthals incapable sympathizing plight sisters, wrong. Another, unmentionable reason may chauvinism permeates Western military culture. U.S. military life, despite increasing female recruitment even "female engagement teams," remains bastion masculinity, little sensitivity toward questions female rights. For military leadership recruits alike, immured almost exclusively male world, complete absence women Afghanistan's streets villages elicited comment Marines surrounded Pat, though woman noticed immediately. And ready availability pornography U.S. bases, coupled seamier depictions life West, damages prospects gender equality extension, Western interests. As one young, well-educated 24-year-old Afghan male pointed out, "Your culture respect women all. Look pornography way exploit women ways can't even imagine. Do call progress?" Added another Afghan USAID programmer working Gardez, man 50s father three girls, "It would better coalition could figure way limit kind material." We better -- much better. The Obama administration must instill military personnel senior diplomats necessity fully protecting women's rights. Key educating gender equality furthers Western interests security. The military spend less time courting "moderate" Taliban time showing Afghan community leaders gender equality -- including female access family planning methods -- result healthier families, lower maternal child death rates, poverty alleviation, greater self-determination. Gender included component governance training placed front center upcoming "peace jirga" include Taliban. Indeed, let half negotiating team representing government coalition female: yes, full 50 percent. Women must also represented government. As Melanne Verveer, U.S. ambassador large global women's issues, noted <http://www.state.gov/s/gwi/rls/rem/2009/125512.htm> last summer, speaking female politicians Afghanistan, "There one minister cabinet, powerless. There low percentage women civil service. There one female governor, Bamiyan." Obama must insist important changes women leave make subsequent aid contingent upon maintenance strong presence women Afghan government. Better yet, coalition needs support "regime change" building democratic institutions groom moderate, educated middle class young women men eventually take over. Over two-thirds Afghan population age 25, either real opportunity social change -- educated given chance shape society progressive way -- major obstacle, find without jobs, unable marry, burdened retrograde attitudes means male female. We must hold Afghanistan responsible treaty obligations U.N. Convention Elimination Discrimination Women (CEDAW) U.N. Security Council Resolution 1325 women, peace, security. UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774862 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774862 Date: 08/31/2015 Afghanistan signed CEDAW without reservations (the United States interestingly, not), means committed passing whatever legislation necessary implement wide-ranging principles gender equality enshrined treaty. This includes taking measures ensure women enjoy basic human rights fundamental freedoms men, place legal judicial procedures protect rights women, taking measures eliminate sexist discrimination, lastly, submitting national reports every four years U.N. advisory group international experts, CEDAW Committee, ensure transparency measures country taken implement treaty's provisions. Unanimously adopted 2000, UNSC 1325 marked first time Security Council recognized disproportionate unique impact armed conflict women stressed importance equal full participation active agents peace security. Needless say, women currently enjoy fundamental freedoms men, indeed, passing Shiite family law, many worse before. To change this, coalition needs stay Afghanistan. Withdrawing critical juncture would doom Afghanistan entire region instability effectively consign one half population premature death existence fit animals. We creating shameful American tradition leaving women better (Afghanistan) -- even much worse (Iraq) -- U.S. troops intervened. On basis America's track record, women around world faith U.S. soldiers improve security. Despite Clinton's remarks link gender equality security, ground Americans act women's well-being, end, peripherally related issue peace. As seen, view could wrong. Verveer's benchmarks <http://www.state.gov/s/gwi/rls/rem/2009/125512.htm> concerning Afghanistan right ones: "Progress Afghanistan must measured military terms, also terms social, political, economic participation women rebuilding Afghanistan safeguarding human rights."

Political stability depends upon economic stability. Removing funding specifically threatens community policing, creating vacuum Real IRA men violence would rush into. Cutting public sector would make difficult increase private sector investment. Does new government understand US interest NI appreciate fragility situation? 2. Defense Foreign Policy Cuts. The new government program slash deficit, cutting deeply government programs. This really cannot done without defense foreign policy reductions. Seek claficiation exactly whether cuts made. Will affect Afghanistan policy schedule? How cuts foreign service affect British influence areas? 3. Trident Nuclear Deterrent. The coalition agreement Conservative Liberal Democrats allows LDs abstain parliamentary votes four issues apparently let Tories way: marriage tax allowances; nuclear power; college tuition fees; Trident nuclear deterrent. During campaign, LDs ran eliminating Trident erasing UK nuclear deterrent. How actually work practice?

The Taliban B6 stronger, confident, ever. ISAF inflicting heavy losses them, scale nothing compared mujahideen endured hands Russians. Moreover, change rules engagement — prevent civilian casualties, fewer night raids — interpreted Taliban signalling weakness NATO's part. In e w , East, Kunduz, effectively lost Taliban fellow travellers. US forces East controlled ground occupied passed over, little more: similar position Soviet Army. Moreover, population want back them, resisting US attempts set tribal militias implant US Special Forces villages. did, however, acknowledge heard US Marines Helmand behaving much sensitively towards population expected. But situation Marjah good. Of course, Marines held ground, violence would continue months years. This offer positive signal momentum Coalition hoping. KANDAHAR 3. said repeatedly understand strategy Kandahar. The Taliban effectively penetrated, argely controlled, city one million people. The ANP largely Barakzai, working either Taliban Ahmed Wali Karzai's network. AWK centre vast criminal enterprise: brother-in-law one largest drug traffickers south. When I said surely ISAF could gradually occupy city, squeezing Taliban back out,F7said certain that: thought might well quite violent resistance Taliban. He also dismissive ISAF strategy "managing" AWK: latter really abandon criminal ways, would dead. He would lose protection militias. In situations, one could move forward, go prison exile: going back. AWK many enemies survive Kandahar without protection criminal networks.77guess AWK would promise good, reality stick old habits, hope profit action taken ISAF Taliban. dismissive efforts empower Governor Weesa, would survive five minutes Kandahar without Western support protection. Although Weesa came area, power base, and, Canadian nationality, regarded Kandaharis foreigner. 4. also sceptical whether ISAF could "shura" way success Kandahar. On military side, thought ISAF couldn't generate force densities necessary control city: example, thought Argandab would require getting 15,000 troops control properly. The city Kandahar would require 10,000 fresh police, available. NEXT STEPS 5. said worried coalition heading.

MAKING PEACE 6.F7said that, view, way negotiated peace Taliban parties conflict. He thought Pakistan would need help Karzai Americans open dialogue Taliban, but, sooner later, Pakistan Karzai would need moved one side, would need direct talks Americans Taliban. The Taliban would make final peace Karzai, little credibility left. Similarly, senior Taliban leaders would need brought across border Afghanistan, get control ISI. All would need deception trickery: first time careerould see diplomats needed, case finesse delicate process, involving multiple negotiations. Karzai would eased out, gently plenty public respect. 7. said would need cease-fire, wondered ISAF couldn't occupy high ground first offer move. There would also frank discussions withdrawal foreign forces. 8. said main worry Obama Administration would waste another year ploughing military campaign could deliver stalemate best, serious reverse worst. Then, 2011-12 Presidential election campaign getting going, White House would panic, handing problem Pakistan, pull US troops quickly situation merited. It vital get ahead curve, start making preparations messy political process could last months years. 9. said known 2001 Western intervention Afghanistan fraught danger. He suspected then, knew even strongly now, Taliban could defeated even properly contained military means. Once again, sick worry way things going. He thought Obama Administration understood solutions Afghanistan political, military. He trying think concerned experts could shock Administration getting political grip situation: considering joint op-ed group experts. The seriousness situation meant article would concentrate essentials: much talk counter-insurgency (in Afghan civil war) development governance "poetry". 10. I pointed political difficulties US Western governments negotiating direct Taliban. Although principle negotiated peace accepted, less, Washington London, long way go politicians fully addressed might involve. Hence argument needed - first get front foot militarily.

The polls tend fluctuate couple points either way, shifts within margin error average. With new polls pointing firming Labour support, party may enjoyed small boost manifesto launch. Tory strategists hope achieved boost manifesto launch today. If Populus figures repeated general election three weeks' time, uniform switch votes, Labour would largest single party, 300 MPs, ahead Tories 264 Lib Dems 54. This would point Lab/Lib Dem coalition.

They wrongly identified four: reducing increase national insurance contributions (naming Labour Tories); allowing unsuccessful schools, hospitals police (the Tories, Labour); tightening takeover rules (the Tories Labour); requiring foreign workers employed public services speak fluent English (the Tories Labour). In one case, £150-a-year tax break, half voters (60 per cent) correctly identify party making proposal. In cases, pledge make little difference people's votes, apart three made Labour: foreign workers language pledge, doubling paid paternity leave allowing takover unsuccessful schools, hospitals etc. More two fifths (43 per cent), including 50 per cent women, say "none parties", "don't know", asked party putting across convincing cases voters.

Ever since became Secretary State, favorables soared mid-60's <http://www.pollingreport.com/C2.htm#Hillary>, putting well clear statewide officeholder country. The national figures viewed favorably Clinton Michelle Obama <http://www.pollingreport.com/o.htm#Michelle>, Colin Powell <http://www.pollingreport.com/p.htm#Powell>, David Patraeus <http://www.pollingreport.com/p.htm#Petraeus>. However, never run office, invariably lowers favorables. Hillary Clinton turn 69 final week 2016 campaign, makes slightly younger Ronald Reagan first elected 1980. Also, Secretary State, major presidential candidate, U.S. Senator, First Lady, also probably credentialed potential Presidential candidate, too. There even talk may become next Secretary Defense <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/O51O/37672.html>, adding credentials. Some said that, choosing Joe Biden Vice-President, Barack Obama pick successor lead Democratic Party. However, needs rethinking.

April 22, 2010 Op-Ed Columnist Obama Backs Down Sudan By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF JUBA, Sudan Until reached White House, Barack Obama repeatedly insisted United States apply pressure Sudan avoid humanitarian catastrophe Darfur elsewhere. Yet, president, Mr. Obama aides caved, leaving Sudan gloating American weakness. Western monitors, Sudanese journalists local civil society groups found month's Sudanese elections deeply flawed - yet Mr. Obama's special envoy Sudan, Maj. Gen. Scott Gration, pre-emptively defended elections, saying would "as free fair possible." The White House showed hint backbone hurried reference week "an essential step" "serious irregularities." President Omar Hassan al-Bashir Sudan - man wanted International Criminal Court crimes humanity Darfur - celebrating. His regime calls National Congress Party, N.C.P., quoted Sudan telling rally Blue Nile region: "Even America becoming N.C.P. member. No one will." Memo Mr. Obama: When man charged crimes humanity tells world America pocket, it's time review policy. Perhaps Obama administration caved considers flawed election better election. That's reasonable view, one I share. It's conceivable Mr. Bashir could won quasi-fair election - oil revenues manifestly raised standard living parts Sudan - campaigning create space sharp criticism government. It's also true Sudan behaving better respects.

The Sudanese government gave visa travel permits Darfur, allowing travel legally freely. The real game isn't, fact, Darfur elections maneuvering possible new civil war. The last north-south civil war Sudan ended fragile peace 2005, two million deaths. The peace agreement provided referendum, scheduled take place January, southern Sudanese decide whether secede. They expected vote overwhelmingly form separate country. Then question becomes: north allow South Sudan separate? The south holds great majority country's oil, it's difficult see President Bashir allowing oil fields walk away. "If result referendum independence, going war - complete war," predicts Mudawi Ibrahim Adam, one Sudan's outspoken human rights advocates. He cautions America's willingness turn blind eye election-rigging increases risk Mr. Bashir feel get away war. "They're naïve Washington," Mr. Mudawi said. "They don't understand going on." On hand, senior Sudanese government official, Ghazi Salahuddin, told unequivocally Khartoum, nation's capital, Sudan honor referendum results. And it's certainly plausible north south muddle avoid war, sides exhausted years fighting. Here Juba, South Sudan capital, I met Winnie Wol, 26, fled civil war 1994 militia north attacked village kill, loot, rape burn. Her father many relatives killed, escaped made way Kenya - eventually resettled refugee California. She lives Olathe, Kan., returned first time Sudan visit mother sisters last seen little girl. Ms. Wol, every bit well-dressed American, let tag along journey back village Nyamlell, 400 miles northwest Juba. The trip ended thatch-roof belonged mother, didn't know coming - one home. Ms. Wol crushed. Then scream woman came running. It Ms. Wol's mother, somehow recognizing her, flew •into other's arms. To me, felt like peace dividend. Yet peace fragile, Ms. Wol knows northern forces may come back pillage again. "I don't want war," said, "but I don't think allow us separate." My hunch north hasn't entirely decided do, strong international pressure reduce risk another savage war. If President Obama ever going find voice Sudan, better soon.

When Nixon wanted foreign policy advice, everyone knew got from: Henry Kissinger, variously national security adviser secretary state. In contrast, Mr Obama big foreign policy strategist.

Fifteen months took office, character structure Mr Obama's foreign policy machinery still evolving. But interviews dozens insiders outsiders, including senior officials authorised unauthorised speak, three former national security advisers, clear buck stops with, often floats quite long time around, Mr Obama himself. Foreigners complained tendency domestic agenda crowd international one — passage last week healthcare reform greeted audible sigh relief among US allies. But within foreign policy itself, centralised structure also result many issues left back burner awaiting presidential attention, say critics. "On positive side, conscientious president takes advice widely," says official. "On debit side, president's intelligence, Barack Obama came office little experience. He doesn't much depth issues." The core Mr Obama's foreign policy machinery White House-based National Security Council, advises president co-ordinates activities across increasingly complex alphabet soup Washington departments, military commands intelligence agencies. The widely questioned link chain Jim Jones, whom, many people's surprise, Mr Obama brought national security adviser.

"If ask real national security adviser is, I would say three four, Rahm one Gen Jones probably least important," says another official. Anyone dealt Gen Jones speaks highly matter-of-factness, geniality respect many foreign governments — Pakistan Israel among them. But admitted rather disarmingly last year, taste bureaucracy. Speaking Atlantic Council, think-tank previously worked, Gen Jones provoked laughter said: "I fondly remember [the Atlantic Council] place people actually asked do. In new role I'm finding order basis negotiation." STATE AND DEFENCE DEPARTMENTS An 'alliance unsackables' finds confront inner circle If caveat depiction Obama administration White House-centric, alliance Hillary Clinton Robert Gates, president's secretaries state defence. Mrs Clinton proved one surprises Barack Obama's tenure, forging strong working relationship former rival establishing chief foreign policy spokesperson internationally — home, Mr Obama's inner circle often seems monopolise explaining. Mr Gates, recently decided stay least another year, seen unsackable, least credibility lends issues ranging missile defence Guantanamo Bay Afghanistan. As holdover Bush administration, national security bona fides hard dispute. It coincidence Mrs Clinton probably unsackable cabinet member. The combination made felt administration's significant debates, notably Afghanistan, successfully urged deployment troops." Gates Clinton happen like other, one really predicted," says one official, notes traditional role NSC "play referee" state defence departments, often nowadays combination two White House. This different worked Donald Rumsfeld Colin Powell held positions."We work together well," Mr Gates said appearance Mrs Clinton CNN last year. "I think starts with, frankly, based experience, secretary defence willing acknowledge secretary state principal spokesperson United States foreign policy." Their outlooks often overlap. From Pentagon, Mr Gates long called US spending diplomacy. As chief diplomat, Mrs Clinton adopted muscular approach. On Iran, favour tough sanctions; Russia, sought reassure Moscow's neighbours even improving relations Kremlin. But workmanlike co-operation, escaping fact Mrs Clinton part Obama inner circle — traditionally helpful feature job. There also constant "residue friction" Mr Obama's Mrs Clinton's teams, according insiders. For example, Cheryl Mills, Mrs Clinton's chief staff, several run-ins others administration. One official describes Mrs Clinton "totally loyal" Mr Obama. He adds: "She president best friends — could be? But totally respects presidency — married president wanted one... She still might be."

Perhaps best example Arab- Israeli peace process, Mr Obama launched second day office appointed George Mitchell envoy. Three months later, Mr Obama insisted Benjamin Netanyahu freeze settlements activity order boost Arab confidence talks. In heated showdown Oval Office last May, Mr Netanyahu refused accede Mr Obama's demand, officials present Mr Emanuel David Axelrod, senior adviser Mr Obama office campaign. Gen Jones there. The fallout put talks abeyance damped high Arab hopes Mr Obama. "The question is, bright spark advised president demand settlements freeze without working next step Netanyahu inevitably said 'No'?" says Leslie Gelb, official Carter administration former head Council Foreign Relations. "Why wasn't George Mitchell room? Where Jones?"Mr Obama's character also stamped inter-agency process, set managed Tom Donilon, deputy national security adviser. The nitty-gritty foreign policy-making done frequent "deputies' meetings", sometimes consume four six hours day. Described one insider "the powerful man White House whose name isn't widely known", Mr Donilon, official Clinton administration, man keeps Mr Obama's trains running time. And lot trains. Last year, Mr Donilon held 270 deputies meetings — workload described "clinically insane" former senior diplomat Bill Clinton. But time goes on, becoming streamlined — taking roughly two three hours day, say officials. "People forget inherited two wars, terrorism threats, perhaps biggest single eight-year decline [George W. Bush's two terms] America's power reputation history," says senior official. "It took time put place process could deal complex decisions take." Also organiser Mr Obama's 9.30am national security briefing, Mr Donilon reinstated paper trails needed prevent intra-governmental anarchy, using model de-vised Brent Scowcroft, national se-curity adviser George Bush senior Gerald Ford.

"If look 2002 2003 meeting decision go war Iraq taken, cannot find it," says senior official. "By getting process right, improving quality decisions." The deputies' ties go back years. For example, families Mr Donilon Jim Steinberg, deputy secretary state, often go holiday together. Mr Donilon's wife, Cathy Russell, chief staff Jill Biden, vice-president's wife.

This well, since spend half lives together: "A lot work gets done group," says Ms Flournoy. "Sometimes feels like shovelling coal keep fires going." The refurbished machinery perhaps evidence build-up Mr Obama's decision December send another 30,000 US troops Afghanistan — journey took four months involved 40 hours Oval Office meetings.

"McDonough guy campaign one plays basketball president — they're close," says official. "Instead Jim Jones telling McDonough president thinks, way round." Indeed, Mr Obama's highly centralised foreign policy machine face, would Mr McDonough's.

My response always same: Germany changed little, Europe world changed lot. Therein lies dilemma. Germany worked hard dig way disaster 1945, trauma remains defining issue German society. Sixty five years later, Germany still focused three essentials recovery: stability, respectability peace. Keep triangle mind lots things quickly come focus. From first days Federal Republic, Germany's leaders emphasized importance defining interests solely within common European Atlantic vocation. But also understood renouncing national ambitions remove responsibility pursue specific German goals common institutions. Many important postwar accomplishments conceived pushed Germany, sometimes opposition others — including United States. Ostpolitik controversial years, NATO enlargement. Germany pushed determination.

Part today's misunderstanding caused Germany's success using contributions build image selflessness. Germany single-minded pursuit goals Charles de Gaulle ever his, almost always left leadership others. A new consciousness grew costs reunification began mount. "Europe" institutional sense become increasingly unpopular. German courts begun define German European issues context German Constitution rather basis E.U. law. At least Ms. Merkel's refusal allow immediate assistance Greece based fears would fan anti-E.U. sentiment home. Are first signs German Tea Party? Here find source hand wringing Germany's role "motor Europe." Ms. Merkel's unwillingness sweeten financial pot echoed throughout Brussels. To many, signified decline German willingness "salute French flag three times raising German flag," Konrad Adenauer used put it. Germans alone objecting throwing money E.U. pot, happen ones something it. Many fear without German complaisance, E.U. stutter stop. But self- denial could never offer viable foundation new Europe. Neither could inefficiency even corruption characterizes many E.U. programs. Most maddening thinking Europeans knowledge Germans right.

And Angela Merkel raps Greek knuckles, sending message Europeans don't want hear. Not Germany dangerous; even worse, unrelenting. The Neue Zuricher Zeitung probably spoke many others accused Germany wanting Europe become large Switzerland. The growing gap Germany's aspirations perceived needs members E.U. beginning burden sides. Most Europeans simply ready live German standards. Without flexible sense common purpose, project build democratic Europe could stop dead water. But Germans often tell you: They forgotten dream. Younger Germans feel lack inspiration well. Dreams 200,000 waiting hear rallied hear Barack Obama Berlin two summers ago. They wanted "Dare Hope," characteristically timid German translation title president's best seller. And still waiting. America seems busy elsewhere. The main conclusion I draw debate Germany Germany all. The task building democratic Europe far complete. Most foundations laid residents starting haggle design. Weaving today's 27 states true trans-Atlantic partnership task big Germany even Europe accomplish alone. They desperately need skilled architectural assistance.

Davis http://thehill.com/opinion/columnists/lanny-davis/102357-message-to-turkish-pm-erdogan When several years ago I first met Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan pleasure two private conversations him, immediately struck ultimate "purple" leader. As The Washington Post wrote recently, "Erdogan's Justice Development Party religious roots, also draws conservative entrepreneurs liberals free-market policies." But Erdogan recently appeared hostile Israel, also U.S. — flirting Holocaust denier Mahmoud Ahmadinejad undermining (apparently unintentionally) world's efforts prevent Iran developing nuclear weapon. Concerning recent flotilla incident, question Israel made serious mistakes planning, intelligence execution onboard deaths horrible tragic. But Erdogan's harsh criticism struck many people, even friends Turkey, way top, ignoring basic facts. So I ask Prime Minister Erdogan, I still believe good heart wants right thing, assume faced following purely hypothetical facts leader country: Suppose years Greek Cypriots shooting rockets intentionally aimed Turkish Cypriot civilians, causing many deaths injuries, result, Turkey instituted blockade, insisting searching ships armaments; Suppose learned flotilla ships leaving Greek ports destined Greek Cyprus, called "Free Turkish Cyprus" flotilla sponsored Greek organization leaders hostile Turkey associations anti-Turkish terrorist organization; UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775652 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775652 Date: 08/31/2015 Suppose ordered ships inspected armaments leaders ships refused, soldiers boarding ships accosted people pipes, iron bars long knives, putting Turkish soldiers mortal danger; soldiers, seeing brothers sisters danger, reacted instinctively shooting live ammunition, tragically killing nine people, members organization linked anti- Turkish terrorist organization. Mr. Prime Minister: If true — fact, "hypotheticals" precisely tracks circumstances Israel faced — would Turkey done? Now, Turkish colleagues may argue big difference Israel "occupying" West Bank. Oh, really? An awful lot Greeks much rest world believe, rightly wrongly, Turkey occupying one- half Cyprus military invasion years ago.

Compare Turks Agia Sophia Israel's protection sanctity guaranteed absolute access Muslims holy sites ancient Temple Mount al-Aqsa Mosque facing Mecca Dome Rock ever since Israel regained control Jerusalem 1967. These facts, Mr. Prime Minister. Do deny them? I hoping discover entire truth risks Israel's safety security represented Gaza-bound ships, recognize Turkey's history role occupier free criticism, find way re-engage prior friendship relationship Israel, especially regard peace process, open discussions Israeli leaders, I know appreciated constructive role played years.

In response, unwittingly produced damning indictment organized American Jewish community I ever seen. The philanthropists wanted know Jewish students thought Israel. Luntz found mostly didn't. "Six times brought Jewish youth together group talk Jewishness connection Israel," reported. "Six times topic Israel come prompted. Six times Jewish youth used word 'they' rather `us' describe situation." That Luntz encountered indifference surprising. In recent years, several studies revealed, words Steven Cohen Hebrew Union College Ari Kelman University California bavis, "non-Orthodox younger Jews, whole, feel much less attached Israel elders," many professing "a near-total absence positive feelings." In 2008, student senate Brandeis, nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored university America, rejected resolution commemorating sixtieth anniversary Jewish state. UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015 Luntz's task figure gone wrong. When probed students' views Israel, hit firm beliefs. First, "they reserve right question Israeli position." These young Jews, Luntz explained, "resist anything see 'group think." They want "open frank" discussion Israel flaws. Second, "young Jews desperately want peace." When Luntz showed series ads, one popular entitled "Proof Israel Wants Peace," listed offers various Israeli governments withdraw conquered land. Third, "some empathize plight Palestinians." When Luntz displayed ads depicting Palestinians violent hateful, several focus group participants criticized stereotypical unfair, citing Muslim friends. Most students, words, liberals, broadly defined. They imbibed defining values American Jewish political culture: belief open debate, skepticism military force, commitment human rights. And innocence, realize supposed shed values came Israel. The kind Zionism found attractive Zionism recognized Palestinians deserving dignity capable peace, quite willing condemn Israeli government share beliefs. Luntz grasp irony. The kind Zionism found attractive kind American Jewish establishment working lives. Among American Jews today, great many Zionists, especially Orthodox world, people deeply devoted State Israel. And great many liberals, especially secular Jewish world, people deeply devoted human rights people, Palestinians included. But two groups increasingly distinct. Particularly younger generations, fewer fewer American Jewish liberals Zionists; fewer fewer American Jewish Zionists liberal. One reason leading institutions American Jewry refused foster—indeed, actively opposed—a Zionism challenges Israel's behavior West Bank Gaza Strip toward Arab citizens. For several decades, Jewish establishment asked American Jews check liberalism Zionism's door, now, horror, finding many young Jews checked Zionism instead. Morally, American Zionism downward spiral. If leaders groups like AIPAC Conference Presidents Major American Jewish Organizations change course, wake one day find younger, Orthodox- dominated, Zionist leadership whose naked hostility Arabs Palestinians scares even them, mass secular American Jews range apathetic appalled. Saving liberal Zionism United States—so American Jews help save liberal Zionism Israel—is great American Jewish challenge age. And starts Luntz's students wanted start: talking frankly Israel's current government, longer averting eyes. Since 1990s, journalists scholars describing bifurcation Israeli society. In words Hebrew University political scientist Yaron Ezrahi, "After decades came called national consensus, Zionist narrative liberation [has] dissolved openly contesting versions." One version, "founded long memory persecution, genocide, bitter struggle survival, pessimistic, distrustful non-Jews, believing Jewish power solidarity." Another, "nourished secularized versions messianism well Enlightenment idea progress," articulates "a deep sense limits military force, commitment liberal-democratic values." Every country manifests kind ideological divide. But contemporary Israel, gulf among widest earth. As Ezrahi others noted, latter, liberal-democratic Zionism grown alongside new individualism, particularly among secular Israelis, greater demand free expression, greater skepticism coercive authority. You see spirit "new historians" like Tom Segev fearlessly excavated darker corners Zionist past jurists like former Supreme Court President Aharon Barak overturned Knesset laws violate human rights guarantees Israel's "Basic Laws." You also see former Prime Minister Ehud Barak's apparent willingness relinquish much West Bank 2000 early 2001. But Israel today, humane, universalistic Zionism wield power. To contrary, gasping air. To understand deeply antithetical values Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, it's worth considering case Effi Eitam. Eitam, charismatic ex–cabinet minister war hero, proposed ethnically cleansing Palestinians West Bank. "We'll expel overwhelming majority West Bank Arabs remove Israeli Arabs [the] political system," declared 2006. In 2008, Eitam merged small Ahi Party Netanyahu's Likud. And 2009-2010 academic year, Netanyahu's special emissary overseas "campus engagement." In capacity, visited dozen American high schools colleges last fall Israeli government's behalf. The group organized tour called "Caravan Democracy." Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman shared Eitam's views. In youth, briefly joined Meir Kahane's banned Kach Party, also advocated expulsion Arabs Israeli soil. Now Lieberman's position might called "pre-expulsion." He wants revoke citizenship Israeli Arabs won't swear loyalty oath Jewish UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015 state. He tried prevent two Arab parties opposed Israel's 2008-2009 Gaza war running candidates Knesset. He said Arab Knesset members met representatives Hamas executed. He wants jail Arabs publicly mourn Israeli Independence Day, hopes permanently deny citizenship Arabs countries marry Arab citizens Israel. You don't paranoid see connection Lieberman's current views former ones. The strip Israeli Arabs legal protection, accuse treason, thinkable policy expulsion becomes. Lieberman's American defenders often note theory supports Palestinian state. What usually fail mention him, two-state solution means redrawing Israel's border large chunk Israeli Arabs find exiled another country, without consent. Lieberman served chief staff Netanyahu's first term prime minister. And comes West Bank, Netanyahu's record way even extreme protégé's. In 1993 book, A Place among Nations, Netanyahu rejects idea Palestinian state, denies thing Palestinian. In fact, repeatedly equates Palestinian bid statehood Nazism. An Israel withdraws West Bank, declared, would "ghetto-state" "Auschwitz borders." And effort "to gouge Judea Samaria [the West Bank] Israel" resembles Hitler's bid wrench German-speaking "Sudeten district" Czechoslovakia 1938. It unfair, Netanyahu insists, ask Israel concede territory since already made vast, gut-wrenching concessions. What kind concessions? It abandoned claim Jordan, rights part Jewish state. On left Netanyahu's coalition sits Ehud Barak's emasculated Labor Party, whatever moderating potential may counterbalanced is, ways, illiberal coalition partner all, Shas, ultra- Orthodox party representing Jews North African Middle Eastern descent. At one point, Shas—like Ashkenazi ultra-Orthodox counterparts—was open dismantling settlements. In recent years, however, ultra-Orthodox. Israelis, anxious find housing large families, increasingly moved West Bank, thanks government subsidies far cheaper live. Not coincidentally, political parties swung hard territorial compromise. And done virulence reflects ultra-Orthodox Judaism's profound hostility liberal values. Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Shas's immensely powerful spiritual leader, called Arabs "vipers," "snakes," "ants." In 2005, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon proposed dismantling settlements Gaza Strip, Yosef urged "God strike down." The official Shas newspaper recently called President Obama "an Islamic extremist." Hebrew University Professor Ze'ev Sternhell expert fascism winner prestigious Israel Prize. Commenting Lieberman leaders Shas recent Op-Ed Haaretz, wrote, "The last time politicians holding views similar power post—World War II Western Europe Franco's Spain." With blessing, "a crude multifaceted campaign waged foundations democratic liberal order." Sternhell know. In September 2008, injured settler set pipe bomb house. Israeli governments come go, Netanyahu coalition product frightening, long-term trends Israeli society: ultra-Orthodox population increasing dramatically, settler movement growing radical entrenched Israeli bureaucracy army, Russian immigrant community particularly prone anti-Arab racism. In 2009, poll Israel Democracy Institute found 53 percent Jewish Israelis (and 77 percent recent immigrants former USSR) support encouraging Arabs leave country. Attitudes worst among Israel's young. When Israeli high schools held mock elections last year, Lieberman won. This March, poll found 56 percent Jewish Israeli high school students—and 80 percent religious Jewish high school students—would deny Israeli Arabs right elected Knesset. An education ministry official called survey "a huge warning signal light strengthening trends extremist views among youth." You might think trends, sympathy expressed Israel's government, would occasion substantial public concern—even outrage—among leaders organized American Jewry. You would wrong. In Israel itself, voices left, even center, warn increasingly urgent tones threats Israeli democracy. (Former Prime Ministers Ehud Olmert Ehud Barak said Israel risks becoming "apartheid state" continues hold West Bank. This April, settlers forced large Israeli bookstore stop selling book critical occupation, Shulamit Aloni, former head dovish Meretz Party, declared "Israel democratic time now.") But United States, groups like AIPAC Presidents' Conference patrol public discourse, scolding people contradict vision Israel state leaders cherish democracy yearn peace. The result terrible irony. In theory, mainstream American Jewish organizations still hew liberal vision Zionism. On website, AIPAC celebrates Israel's commitment "free speech minority rights." The Conference Presidents UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015 declares "Israel United States share political, moral intellectual values including democracy, freedom, security peace." These groups would never say, Netanyahu's coalition, Israeli Arabs don't deserve full citizenship West Bank Palestinians don't deserve human rights. But practice, defending virtually anything Israeli government does, make intellectual bodyguards Israeli leaders threaten liberal values profess admire. After Israel's elections last February, instance, Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice-chairman Presidents' Conference, explained Avigdor Lieberman's agenda "far moderate media presented it." Insisting Lieberman bears general animus toward Israeli Arabs, Abraham Foxman, national director Anti- Defamation League, told Jewish Telegraphic Agency "He's saying expel them. He's saying punish them." (Permanently denying citizenship Arab spouses jailing publicly mourn Israeli Independence Day evidently qualify punishment.) The ADL criticized anti-Arab bigotry past, American Jewish Committee, credit, warned Lieberman's proposed loyalty oath would "chill Israel's democratic political debate." But Forward summed overall response America's communal Jewish leadership headline "Jewish Leaders Largely Silent Lieberman's Role Government." Not organized American Jewish community mostly avoid public criticism Israeli government, tries prevent others leveling criticism well. In recent years, American Jewish organizations waged campaign discredit world's respected international human rights groups. In 2006, Foxman called Amnesty International report Israeli killing Lebanese civilians "bigoted, biased, borderline anti-Semitic." The Conference Presidents announced "biased NGOs include Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Christian Aid, [and] Save Children." Last summer, AIPAC spokesman declared Human Rights Watch "has repeatedly demonstrated anti-Israel bias." When Obama administration awarded Presidential Medal Freedom Mary Robinson, former UN high commissioner human rights, ADL AIPAC protested, citing fact presided 2001 World Conference Against Racism Durban, South Africa. (Early drafts conference report implicitly accused Israel racism. Robinson helped expunge defamatory charge, angering Syria Iran.) Human Rights Watch Amnesty International infallible. But groups like AIPAC Presidents' Conference avoid virtually public criticism Israeli actions—directing outrage solely Israel's neighbors—they leave poor position charge bias. Moreover, American Jewish groups claim simply defending Israel foes, actually taking sides struggle within Israel radically different Zionist visions. At moment Anti-Defamation League claimed Robinson harbored "animus toward Israel," alliance seven Israeli human rights groups publicly congratulated award. Many groups, like B'Tselem, monitors Israeli actions Occupied Territories, Israeli branch Physicians Human Rights, least critical Israel's actions Lebanon, Gaza, West Bank Amnesty International Human Rights Watch. All raises uncomfortable question. If American Jewish groups claim Israel's overseas human rights critics motivated anti- Israeli, anti-Semitic, bias, say Israel's domestic human rights critics? The implication clear: must guilty self-hatred, treason. American Jewish leaders don't generally say that, course, allies Netanyahu government do. Last summer, Israel's vice prime minister, Moshe Ya'alon, called anti-occupation group Peace Now "virus." This January, right-wing group called Im Tirtzu accused Israeli human rights organizations fed information Goldstone Commission investigated Israel's Gaza war. A Knesset member Netanyahu's Likud promptly charged Naomi Chazan, head New Israel Fund, supports human rights groups, treason, member Lieberman's party launched investigation aimed curbing foreign funding Israeli NGOs. To credit, Foxman American Jewish leaders opposed move, might impaired work. But reaping sowed. If suggest mainstream human rights criticism Israel's government motivated animus toward state, toward Jews general, give aid comfort Israel make charges human rights critics midst. In American Jewish establishment today, language liberal Zionism—with idioms human rights, equal citizenship, territorial compromise—has drained meaning. It remains lingua franca part generational reasons, many older American Zionists still see liberals sort. They vote Democratic; unmoved biblical claims West Bank; see average Palestinians decent people betrayed bad leaders; secular. They don't want Jewish organizations criticize Israel left, neither want agents Israeli right. UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015 These American Zionists largely product particular era. Many shaped terrifying days leading Six-Day War, appeared Israel might overrun, bitter aftermath Yom Kippur War, much world seemed turn Jewish state. In crucible, Israel became Jewish identity, often conjunction Holocaust, 1967 1973 wars helped make central American Jewish life. These Jews embraced Zionism settler movement became major force Israeli politics, 1982 Lebanon war, first intifada. They fell love Israel secular, less divided, less shaped culture, politics, theology occupation. And downplaying significance Avigdor Lieberman, settlers, Shas, American Jewish groups allow older Zionists continue identify internally cohesive, innocent Israel youth, Israel exists memories. But secular Zionists aren't reproducing themselves. Their children memory Arab armies massed Israel's border Israel surviving part thanks urgent military assistance United States. Instead, grown viewing Israel regional hegemon occupying power. As result, conscious parents degree Israeli behavior violates liberal ideals, less willing grant Israel exemption survival seems peril. Because inherited parents' liberalism, cannot embrace uncritical Zionism. Because liberalism real, see liberalism American Jewish establishment fake. To sustain uncritical brand Zionism, therefore, America's Jewish organizations need look elsewhere replenish ranks. They need find young American Jews come age West Bank occupation troubled it. And young American Jews come disproportionately Orthodox world. Because marry earlier, intermarry less, children, Orthodox Jews growing rapidly share American Jewish population. According 2006 American Jewish Committee (AJC) survey, Orthodox Jews make 12 percent American Jewry age sixty, constitute 34 percent ages eighteen twenty-four. For America's Zionist organizations, Orthodox youngsters potential bonanza. In yeshivas learn devotion Israel early age; generally spend year religious study high school, often know friends relatives immigrated Israel. The AJC study found 16 percent non-Orthodox adult Jews age forty feel "very close Israel," among Orthodox figure 79 percent. As secular Jews drift away America's Zionist institutions, Orthodox counterparts likely step breach. The Orthodox "are still interested parochial Jewish concerns," explains Samuel Heilman, sociologist City University New York. "They among last ones stayed Jewish house, control lights." But parochialism—a deep commitment Jewish concerns, often outweighs universal ones— gives Orthodox Jewish Zionism distinctly illiberal cast. The 2006 AJC poll found 60 percent non- Orthodox American Jews age forty support Palestinian state, figure drops 25 percent among Orthodox. In 2009, Brandeis University's Theodore Sasson asked American Jewish focus groups Israel, found Orthodox participants much less supportive dismantling settlements part peace deal. Even tellingly, Reform, Conservative, unaffiliated Jews tended believe average Palestinians wanted peace, ill-served leaders. Orthodox Jews, contrast, likely see Palestinian people enemy, deny ordinary Palestinians shared common interests values ordinary Israelis Jews. Orthodox Judaism great virtues, including communal warmth commitment Jewish learning unmatched American Jewish world. (I'm biased, since family attends Orthodox synagogue.) But current trends continue, growing influence Orthodox Jews America's Jewish communal institutions erode even liberal- democratic veneer today covers American Zionism. In 2002, America's major Jewish organizations sponsored large Israel solidarity rally Washington Mall. Up east coast, yeshivas shut day, swelling estimated Orthodox share crowd close 70 percent. When Deputy Secretary Defense Paul Wolfowitz told rally "innocent Palestinians suffering dying well," booed. America's Jewish leaders think hard rally. Unless change course, portends future: American Zionist movement even feign concern Palestinian dignity broader American Jewish population even feign concern Israel. My children, given upbringing, could easily end among booers among Luntz's focus group. Either prospect fills dread. In 2004, effort prevent weapons smuggling Egypt, Israeli tanks bulldozers demolished hundreds houses Rafah refugee camp southern Gaza Strip.

He said reminded grandmother. In moment, Lapid captured spirit suffocating within organized American Jewish life. To begin with, watched. In experience, epidemic watching among American Zionists today. A Red Cross study malnutrition Gaza Strip, bill Knesset allow Jewish neighborhoods bar entry Israeli Arabs, Israeli human rights report settlers burning Palestinian olive groves, three Palestinian teenagers shot—it's unpleasant. Rationalizing minimizing Palestinian suffering become kind game. In recent report foster Zionism among America's young, Luntz urges American Jewish groups use word "Arabs, Palestinians," since "the term 'Palestinians' evokes images refugee camps, victims oppression," "Arab' says wealth, oil Islam. /7 Of course, Israel—like United States—must sometimes take morally difficult actions defense. But morally difficult allow human connection side. Otherwise, security justifies everything. The heads AIPAC Presidents' Conference ask Israel's leaders would say make scream "no." After all, Lieberman foreign minister; Effi Eitam touring American universities; settlements growing triple rate Israeli population; half Israeli Jewish high school students want Arabs barred Knesset. If line yet crossed, line? What infuriated critics Lapid's comment grandmother died Auschwitz. How dare defile memory Holocaust? Of course, Holocaust immeasurably worse anything Israel done ever do. But least Lapid used Jewish suffering connect suffering others. In world AIPAC, Holocaust analogies never stop, message always same: Jews licensed victimhood worry themselves. Many Israel's founders believed statehood, Jews would rightly judged way treated non-Jews living dominion. "For first time shall majority living minority," Knesset member Pinchas Lavon declared 1948, "and shall called upon provide example prove Jews live minority." But message American Jewish establishment allies Netanyahu government exactly opposite: since Jews history's permanent victims, always knife-edge extinction, moral responsibility luxury Israel have. Its responsibility survive. As former Knesset speaker Avraham Burg writes remarkable 2008 book, The Holocaust Is Over; We Must Rise From Its Ashes, "Victimhood sets free." This obsession victimhood lies heart Zionism dying among America's secular Jewish young. It simply bears relationship lived experience, seen Israel's. Yes, Israel faces threats Hezbollah Hamas. Yes, Israelis understandably worry nuclear Iran. But dilemmas face possess dozens hundreds nuclear weapons, adversary, however despicable, may acquire one, dilemmas Warsaw Ghetto. The year 2010 not, Benjamin Netanyahu claimed, 1938. The drama Jewish victimhood—a drama feels natural many Jews lived 1938, 1948, even 1967—strikes today's young American Jews farce. But different Zionist calling, never desperately relevant. It roots Israel's Independence Proclamation, promised Jewish state "will based precepts liberty, justice peace taught Hebrew prophets," December 1948 letter Albert Einstein, Hannah Arendt, others The New York Times, protesting right-wing Zionist leader Menachem Begin's visit United States party's militias massacred Arab civilians village Deir Yassin. It call recognize world Jewish fortunes have•radically changed, best way memorialize history Jewish suffering ethical use Jewish power. For several months now, group Israeli students traveling every Friday East Jerusalem neighborhood Sheikh Jarrah, Palestinian family named Ghawis lives street outside home fifty-three years, evicted make room Jewish settlers. Although repeatedly arrested protesting without permit, called traitors self-haters Israeli right, students keep coming, numbers swelling thousands. What American Jewish organizations brought young people speak Hillel? What face Zionism shown America's Jewish young? What students Luntz's focus group told generation faces challenge momentous Jewish history: save liberal democracy Jewish state earth?

KOUCHNER Le Monde re Internet freedom The Kouchner worth reading haven't seen it. The Internet: critical international policy issue, Bernard Kouchner (May 10, 2010) In 2015, three half billion people - half mankind - access Internet. There never revolution freedom communication freedom expression. But new medium used? What new distortions obstacles enemies Internet come with? Modern technology leads best worst. Extremist, racist defamatory websites blogs disseminate odious opinions real time. They made Internet weapon war hate. Websites attacked Internet users recruited chatrooms destructive plots. Violent movements infiltrating social networks spread propaganda false information. It hard democracies control them. I subscribe naïve belief new technology, however efficient powerful may be, bound nature advance liberty fronts. Yet, same, distortions exception rather rule. The Internet fantastic means breaking walls boundaries close us other. For oppressed peoples, deprived right self-expression right choose future, Internet provides power beyond wildest hopes.

It increasingly difficult hide public demonstration, act repression violation human rights. In authoritarian repressive countries, mobile telephones Internet given rise public opinion civil society. They also given citizens critical means expression, despite restrictions. However, temptation repress free expression always present. The number countries censor Internet, monitor web users punish opinions, increasing alarming rate. The Internet used citizens. It formidable intelligence-gathering tool spot potential dissidents. Some regimes already acquiring increasingly sophisticated surveillance technology. If attached human rights democracy refused compromise principles used Internet defend freedom expression, kind repression would much difficult. I talking absolute freedom opens door sorts abuses. Nobody promoting that. Instead, I'm talking real freedom, based principle respecting human dignity human rights. In last years, multilateral institutions, Council Europe, non-governmental organisations, Reporters Without Borders, along thousands individuals around world, made strong commitment issues. This proof, proof needed, issue pit West rest world. No fewer 180 countries meeting World Summit Information Society acknowledged Universal Declaration Human Rights applies fully Internet, especially Article 19, establishes freedom expression freedom opinion. And yet, fifty countries fail live commitments. For occasion World Press Freedom Day, I brought together experts, NGO leaders, journalists, business people intellectuals week. Their discussions confirmed conviction path want take right one. I think create international instrument monitoring commitments governments made calling task fail live them. I think provide assistance cyberdissidents, get support victims political repression, need show solidarity publicly, close collaboration NGOs working issues. I think also discuss wisdom adopting code conduct regarding export technologies censoring Internet tracking web users. These issues, along others, protection personal data Internet right digital amnesty everyone promoted colleague Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, addressed within framework brings together government, civil society international experts. Another project close heart. It long difficult task implement it, critical. It give Internet legal status reflects universality. One recognizes international space, difficult repressive governments use sovereignty argument fundamental freedoms. This critical issue. I think battle ideas started with, one side, advocates universal open Internet, based freedom expression freedom association, tolerance respect privacy and, side, want transform Internet multitude spaces closed serve purposes regime, propaganda forms fanaticism. Freedom expression "the foundation freedoms". Without it, "free nations", Voltaire said. This spirit Enlightenment, universal, run new media. The defence fundamental freedoms human rights must priority governance Internet. It everyone's business.

Unfortunately, give horrible title, I think piece turned alright. Best, Sandy By Samuel R. Berger Samuel R. Berger, chair global strategy firm Albright Stonebridge Group, served national security advisor President Clinton 1997 2001. President Obama's National Security Strategy, released White House Thursday, tackles delicate unavoidable question: How respond new old security challenges era financial distress home reordering political power abroad? For time now, clear definition U.S. national security strategy needs rethinking. The September 11 attacks, global economic crisis, cyber-terror threats even environmental catastrophe Gulf underscore challenges America faces 2010 changed even decade ago. And America's military supremacy certainly risk, new international arrangements - shift G-7 club powerful nations G-20, incorporates emerging nations China Brazil - needed costs benefits stable international order shared. The United States cannot solve global threats without others, bear burden alone. Enter National Security Strategy. In experience, congressionally mandated documents easily become laborious impenetrable, mere compendiums bureaucratic pleading various parts government. (Make sure right Japan! Don't step Pentagon!)

It's blueprint action, means convey president's principles priorities. In Obama's case, new sober comprehensive 52-page strategy incorporates new realities breaks past strategies several key respects. But also reflects understanding face enduring challenges - nuclear proliferation, terrorism regional conflicts - best response return fundamentals. One fundamental strength economy. At time after-effects financial crisis fiscal burden two long wars raised fears overextended America, administration makes case economic technological renewal crucial underpinning U.S. security. The president made case West Point speech last weekend. "At time human history," said, "has nation diminished economic vitality maintained military political primacy." Another fundamental challenge arms control nuclear proliferation. By seeking strategic arms cuts Russia, president returned long bipartisan tradition languished prior administration. And convening global summit securing nuclear material spring, Obama given new urgency global purchase effort started 1991 Sens. Sam Nunn Richard Lugar first initiated program lock nuclear materials. On terrorism, strategy builds past, breaks well. Presidents Clinton, Bush Obama deployed America's tools: military power, homeland defense, law enforcement, sanctions, intelligence vigorous efforts cut terrorist financing. But critical difference Obama strategy rejects Global War Terror lens prior administration viewed challenge. "This global war tactic - terrorism - religion - Islam," new strategy says. "We war specific network, al-Qaeda terrorist affiliates." This sharper focus avoids alienating many Muslim world, ensures support key allies never accepted broader construct avoids overreactions led us forsake fight aI-Qaeda fight Afghanistan turn efforts unrelated threat Saddam Hussein's Iraq. In perhaps dramatic departure strategy predecessor, Obama administration restored less provocative policy use military force. In 2002 national security strategy, President Bush articulated rationale preemptive war weeks seeking U.N. resolution invade Iraq. The new strategy restores principles guided administrations decades: use force last resort, weigh costs benefits, much international support possible. The administration reserves right act unilaterally - example al-Qaeda allies - resurrects principle President Clinton often described "together possible, alone necessary." President Obama's critics focused diplomatic engagement hostile states like Iran North Korea. The President sets forth rationale: "to create opportunities resolve differences, strengthen international community's support actions, learn intentions nature closed regimes, plainly demonstrate public within nations governments blame isolation." In case Iran, Washington's outstretched hand resulted Iran's compliance. But attempts engage helped ensure world's attention focused Iran's intransigence rather Washington's refusal negotiate.

Benzion constantly criticized public deviations doctrine Greater Israel. Bibi desperately seeks father's approbation never equal dead brother. See Benzion's recent scathing undermining son Bibi Bibi's tearful tribute brother last month. The raid ship Gaza resembles raid Entebbe, except hostages, guns, it's Africa, it's fiasco; otherwise, it's Entebbe. (Then, there's Ehud Barak reliving youth raider killing Palestinians Lebanon, feat memorialized Spielberg's film, Munich. Ultimately, didn't work well time either.

Further observation: The international press inquire whether Obama administration gave wink nod Bush administration Lebanon Gaza incursions. Be prepared. Further: Of course, consequences US foreign policy national security negative across board: analogy North Korean ship sinking Chinese posture support Iranian sanctions, etc., etc. Did Israelis hear Petraeus's testimony?

His policy recommendations follow report. To: Sid Blumenthal From: Scott Horton Date: June 17, 2010 Subj: Developments Kyrgyzstan I Kyrgyzstan June 1– 6, time I met almost members interim government, special focus foreign relations, security legal issues. Here major points emerged visit: UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776479 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776479 Date: 08/31/2015 1. Crisis South. Although I departed pogroms commenced Osh, I found interim government fully expected violence break anticipate inter-ethnic element. Several candidly acknowledged government's grip south, particularly Osh Djalalabad provinces, extremely tenuous. They said severe "loyalty" problems key figures police military. When I pressed meant "loyalty," I told Bakiyev family "its people" key positions police army intercepted communications Janysh Bakiyev number key security officers south. "Something planned disrupt referendum," I told. Beknazarov told believed that, following pattern last two revolutions, anticipated would attack administrative offices south, following quickly within days attacks Bishkek. Government leaders I spoke weekend told recognize misassessed data had, Bakiyev plan obviously instigate inter-ethnic violence. Precisely led tragedy around Osh still unclear requires careful investigation, people I spoken Osh describe police army leaders directing pogroms, able identify individuals persons close Bakiyevs. Moreover, timing specific descriptions events support thesis—Bakiyev person clearly something gain violence. If so, Bakiyev adopted extremely cynical, indeed criminal strategy. His objectives would derail referendum, demonstrate weakness interim government, fuel calls iron-fisted central government resurrection presidency. The tactics used bear comparison used Slobodan Milosevic Radovan Kara&'id Yugoslavia disintegrated Soviet MVD waning days Soviet empire programs like "Operation Koltso." If government's charges bear out, serious crimes committed Bakiyev faction. While Otunbayeva publicly states order restored south foreign intervention longer needed, I persuaded actually thinks. She anxious build public confidence government abilities. Confidentially acknowledges interim government's grip situation south extremely weak government feel necessarily count local police military there, whose loyalties plainly divided. This turn suggests international community give active consideration humanitarian security dimensions situation south. My sense remains Otunbayeva would strongly welcome initiative. 2. Internal Workings Interim Government. The interim government verges completely dysfunctional. It operates collection individual fiefdoms, leaders engaged constant squabbles patronage appointments. Career civil service personnel report terrorized extorted. I spent better part three days inside current government headquarters Staraya Ploshchod able directly observe primitive horse- trading, threats counterthreats key government functionaries, sometimes agitated voices. Roza Otunbayeva handful figures closest exceptions process—admonishing others unseemliness conduct, urging moderation restraint. But Otunbayeva also acknowledges limitations authority states "has put it," least moment. Three government members advised meetings intention resign end month order start running parliament. Significantly, I sense sharp rifts within government—between Atembayev Beknazarov, instance, could refrain criticizing one another interviews them, Sariyev Beknazarov. Only Otunbayeva (and lesser extent close ally Elmira Ibraimova) appear glue holds things together, commanding respect government members. I found admiration Otunbayeva almost universal—she appears figure government emerging interim period untarnished reputation. Still special order assumed power "president interim government" presents clear problems authority. She fixed term 2011, democratic mandate. After new government formed, based parliamentary elections, democratic legitimacy not—this sets situation authority may well eclipsed least made narrow. Still, members current government recognize essential skills not—particularly ability conciliate ability reach leaders international stage.

The next government expected formed parliamentary coalition. But two perhaps three current seven factions survive. Much bickering instability current government keyed coming game parliamentary moving chairs—there intense struggle secure personal loyalty funds use parliamentary elections; entire process aura sink swim it. Ironically immediate prospect parliamentary elections sense genuinely open fair thus contributes ineptness near chaotic appearance current government. 3. Constitution Referendum. Under guidance Tekebayev, government put forward proposed new constitution, seeks confirmed referendum vote June 27. The constitution shift country direction parliamentary democracy, contains unusual protection parliamentary minority factions. Government leaders told Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev waded question constitution directly, pressing retain "strong president" system. They say coupled not-very-subtle threats, frontier Kyrgyzstan Kazakhstan remains closed, harmful consequences Kyrgyz economy. A major question exists holding referendum scheduled. The events south resulted mass displacement population held planned, large part population south would probably disenfranchised. However, government leaders say current problems come back legitimacy, able form government democratic legitimacy without new constitution new elections. Accordingly, resist delays even contemplating moving date parliamentary election forward last week August (it set October 10). The crisis south presents severe dilemma regards, seems would Bakiyev's objective instigating it, indeed did. 4. Manas Transit Center. As expected, I discovered interim government deeply fragmented question MTC. One faction headed Otunbayeva favors "pragmatic solution" base issue continued placed transparent basis economic benefits government clear. Otunbayeva argues base accepted circumstances presents friction Kyrgyz- Russian relations; seeks disputes surrounding fuel supply, instance, resolved directly United States Russia. Another faction, headed Beknazarov, takes demagogic approach, denouncing base seeking closing internal meetings. Talking Beknazarov, I clear impression attitudes entirely opportunistic—he thinks good campaign issue use hustings. He suggested rather strongly could accept continued base presence right circumstances views threats close base sort stick use extort money concessions Americans. In general, Beknazarov strikes hot-headed crass untrustworthy partner future discussions. Atembayev also somewhat demagogic impulses, though mild comparison. Otunbayeva, third senior member government engaged base issues, critical voice reason process. My impression based discussions numerous figures Otunbayeva's views currently hold sway. However, government members agreed economic deal struck Bakiyev unfavorable Kyrgyz state base must rest transparent economic concessions under-the-table dealings political figures. 5. Resolving Crisis South. I believe two key points kept mind approaching humanitarian crisis emerged south. First, crisis probably origins raw struggle power. The interim government's legitimacy deficit contributed problem, left government weak tools control situation south. A long-term solution problem must involve creation governments national (Bishkek) regional (Osh, Djalalabad) levels essential modicum democratic legitimacy. Delaying process may hasten entire country's continued descent chaos. This highlights need conduct free, fair open elections quickly possible. Second, last thing interim government needs "Sophie's choice" United States Russian Federation. International assistance needs reflect joint U.S.-Russian approach showcase U.S. Russian leadership (not merely participation). With President Medvedev's visit White House horizon, would good opportunity establish joint sponsorship international humanitarian initiative. Here, I believe, essential elements program could achieve U.S.- Russian co-sponsorship: UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776479 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776479 Date: 08/31/2015 • An Appeal Restraint: Although instigation conflict appears clearly rest ethnic Kyrgyz agitators, including number uniform operating military equipment, present Uzbek Kyrgyz armed groups involved random shootings designed reinforce perceptions group persecuted (rapes etc.) another. Credible reports suggesting political manipulation (including payment money drug criminal gangs) aimed fomenting violence. The attack sports facility set prominent Uzbek drug baron (murdered several years earlier) Osh shortly violence started also suggests criminal gangs involved drug transshipment another motivation engaging violence. It may violence initiative deposed president, began, provided cover numerous incidents score-settling criminal mischief. In circumstances, strong appeal restraint appropriate martial law rules including curfews may legitimately imposed interim government. An imprimatur support international community would help establish authority interim government process. • Exit Corridors Civilians: Civilians feel threatened must allowed leave high risk zones, access humanitarian aid, creation safe zone humanitarian operation priorities locations created shelter them. The EU, OSCE UN issued statement June 16 calling humanitarian corridor southern regions Osh Jalalabad provinces, well ensuring equitable distribution humanitarian aid among need. The cooperation Uzbek government may particularly important process. • Peacekeeping/Policing Operation: The international community support special arrangements broad international legitimacy participation enhance peacekeeping police operations affected area. As I noted, even though Otunbayeva made public statement June 15 effect foreign military/police intervention longer needed, situation remains precarious confidential discussions Otunbayeva acknowledges benefits confidence building would emerge qualified, professional international presence region. Peacekeeping/policing operations minimum include security designated sheltering areas refugees internally displaced persons monitoring operations tandem local police military, build confidence protective functions. • Investigation Events: broad, credible, independent investigation undertaken events origin. The investigation aegis international organization, Security Council OSCE conducted individual stature strong credentials fact-finder prosecutor. The investigation particularly take cognizance accusations crimes humanity perpetrated, potentially including crimes genocide. The involvement persons exercising ostensible government authority— policemen, military figures, leaders civil administration—should given special scrutiny process. The person commissioned handle investigation specifically empowered recommend criminal charges brought individuals identified investigation—either criminal authorities Kyrgyz Republic international body seized proper jurisdiction. • Effective Post-Conflict Reconstruction. UN authorities estimating many 450,000 persons may displaced current violence. The devastation central Osh numerous villages reported near total. There intense housing shortage crisis respect food supply healthcare. The international community United States Russian leadership provide generous support jumpstart reconstruction process, prioritizing assistance benefit egregiously injured violence. • The Referendum/Parliamentary Elections. In view disruption violence, interim government may well conclude constitutional referendum must postponed. However, postpone referendum, extraordinary measures taken insure internally displaced persons refugees given opportunity vote—in cases reemphasis bond citizenship promise inclusion democratic process critical resolution crisis. The international community also mobilize observers connection parliamentary elections help assure candidates fair access ballot media, campaigns permitted proceed without unreasonable limitations voting occurs fair free manner across country. Special attention process given affected areas insure refugees IDPs fair opportunity vote freed unreasonable limitations process.

UK polls show support Lib-Dems launch draconian Cameron government budget cratering. LD support 16 percent, half peak election half LD members express desire defect party.

The scenario potentially portentous LD Party: There influential Australian Liberal Democratic Party, holding 11 percent vote balance power Australian Senate. Upon reaching zenith 1996 ALDP supported Liberal (that say, conservative) government's budget suffered collapse. Today ALDP holds 1 percent seats lower House. The political effect conservative budget almost certainly lead implosion Tory-LD coalition. In short run it's possible Tories emerge greatest plurality support. But budget produce prosperity pay price, too. See Stiglitz's analysis Tory budget cold analysis US predicament. 2. The implications US-UK cooperation apparent.

More soon... http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politicsksbornes-first-budget-its-wrong-wrong-wrong-2011501.html Osborne's first Budget? It's wrong, wrong, wrong! Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel prizewinner predicted global crisis, delivers verdict Chancellor's first Budget tells Paul Vallely take UK deeper recession hit millions — poorest — badly Sunday, 27 June 2010 George Osborne probably bothered man thinks got last week's emergency Budget almost entirely wrong. But be. Because man former chief economist World Bank won Nobel Prize Economics work markets produce outcomes which, theory, ought to. Professor Joseph Stiglitz, described biggest brain economics, distinctly unimpressed George Osborne's strategy. This, predicts, make Britain's recovery recession longer, slower harder needs be. The rise VAT could even tip us double-dip recession. Stiglitz, Bill Clinton's senior economic adviser, professor economics finance Columbia Business School. He UK week University Manchester, chairs Brooks World Poverty Institute, lifted head detail international development scrutinise economic strategy Conservative Chancellor whose Liberal Democrat partners recently reversed judgement massive public spending cuts would endanger economy joined Tory slash-and-burn strategy. They deeply wrong so, believes. It would mistake ignore Stiglitz this. He track record getting predictions right. He one economists predicted global financial meltdown long occurred. "What happened much accord I expected," tells meet coffee outside Blackwell bookshop centre university. "The data pretty clear that." And scale crash? "That wasn't surprise," adds, matter-of-fact manner. "The bigger bubble, bigger burst. "The thing economists fully grasp extent banks engaged murky risk-taking activities. They taking risk money, shareholders' money, bond-holders' money," says. Banks demanding 40 per cent corporate profits, saying innovative financing adding value. But "all talk innovation sham" relate real increase economy's productivity, says. "There prima facie case something screwy going [with the] perverse incentives would lead take excessive risk. But way anyone could know believe banks [conducting themselves] level stupidity. I predicted going collapse information asymmetry problems created." His Nobel prize given exactly — showing markets fail different people hold different levels information. Yet hint I-told-you-so Stiglitz's tone asks waiter coffee. He orders decaffeinated, suggests British economy needs opposite: stiff stimulant rather "fiscal consolidation" George Osborne's economic euphemism cuts. Fiscal stimulus fashion now. World leaders embarked strategy — injecting money re-energise economy — banking crash three years ago. It widely perceived worked money governments pumped banks passed ailing businesses individuals trouble mortgages. "The problem that, US, stimulus wasn't big enough," says. "Too much tax cuts. And gave money banks gave wrong banks and, result, credit restored — expect couple million homes repossessed year last year — economy UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777221 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777221 Date: 08/31/2015 restarted." Instead producing consensus government done more, created disillusion government anything, Stiglitz says. The result that, following attacks financial markets Greece Spain, everybody mood retrenchment. "It's pre-Keynesian, it's Hooverite," says. By means governments refusing stimulate, making cuts, Herbert Hoover US 1929 — turned Wall Street Crash Great Depression. "Hoover idea that, whenever go recession, deficits grow, decided go cuts — foolish financial markets got us trouble first place want." It become new received wisdom throughout Europe. But classic error made confuse household's economics national economy. "If household can't pay debts, tell cut back spending free cash pay debts. But national economy, cut back spending, economic activity goes down, nobody invests, amount tax take goes down, amount pay unemployment benefits goes — don't enough money pay debts. "The old story still true: cut expenditures economy goes down. We lots experiments show this, thanks Herbert Hoover IMF," adds. The IMF imposed mistaken policy Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Argentina hosts developing countries 1980s 1990s. "So know happen: economies get weaker, investment get stymied it's downward vicious spiral. How far don't know — could Japanese malaise. Japan experiment like 1997; recovering, raised VAT went another recession." Then learned that? Because politicians like George Osborne driven ideology; national deficit excuse shrink state wanted anyway. Because financial market cares one thing — getting repaid. And European governments panicking market's wild attack Greece Spain, don't want next. "But cutbacks Germany, Britain France mean Europe suffer. The cuts feed back negatively. And everyone follows policy, budget deficits get worse, make cuts raise taxes more. It's vicious downward spiral. We're looking long, hard, slow recovery possibility double dip everybody cuts back time. The best scenario long hard ... worst much worse. If one countries forced default, banking system highly leveraged could cause real problems. This really risky, really scary." So doing? "The lesson cut back spending, redirect it. You cut war Afghanistan. You cut couple hundred billion dollars wasteful military expenditure. You cut oil subsidies. There's long list things cut. But increase spending areas, research development, infrastructure, education" — areas government get good return investment public money. "I haven't done calculation Britain, but, US, need return government investment 5 6 per cent long-term deficit debt lowered." Taxes also need restructured. Osborne increased capital gains tax high earners 18 28 per cent. "There's absolutely reason couldn't tax speculative gains [from rising house land prices] 40 per cent. There's social return land going whether people speculated not. But lower tax investment things like R&D." Stiglitz one practical solution offer. Governments set banks restart lending businesses save struggling homeowners repossession. "If banks aren't lending, let's create new lending facility job," says. "In US, gave $700bn banks; used fraction create new bank, could financed lending needed." Indeed, could done far less. "Take $100bn, lever 10 1 [by attracting funds private sector] that's trillion-dollar new lending capacity — real economy needs." Such move would help ordinary people Osborne's rhetoric tough fair. Stiglitz sceptical, too, moral underpinning Budget claims "we together", hits poorest hardest. Analysis Institute Fiscal Studies suggested Chancellor's Budget cost poor 2.5 per cent income, rich lose 1 per cent. "I've made independent study point, cuts public services disproportionate effect poor," Stiglitz says. Osborne's Budget "may well- UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777221 Date: 08/31/2015 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777221 Date: 08/31/2015 intentioned, takes enormous amount work make sure package public spending cuts magnitude doesn't hit poor disproportionately". His big fear overseas aid, protected first round cuts, escape second. "Developing countries redirected towards Asia, China particular, recent years, growth Africa robust one might expected, given severity downturn," says. Even so, aid remains vital poor countries. "If aid cut back, growth badly affected," says. "China providing aid, aid infrastructure, whereas aid US Europe mainly education health - areas ordinary people suffer cuts." Joseph Stiglitz come full circle. What world needs — developing developed — retrenchment greater economic stimulus. It message many mood hear. But didn't listen last time, either. And turned right, wrong — cost us all. UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777221 Date: 08/31/2015
