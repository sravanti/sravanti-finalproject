He appointed skilled special envoy, George Mitchell, demanded Israel freeze settlements, Palestinians crack anti-Israel violence Arab leaders demonstrate readiness reach Israel. Nine months later, president's promising peace initiative unraveled. The Israelis refused stop ail building. The Palestinians say won't talk Israelis do, President Mahmoud Abbas despondent threatened quit. Arab states refusing anything. Mr. Obama's credibility diminished (his approval rating Israel 4 percent) serious negotiations may farther ever. Peacemaking takes strategic skill. But see sign President Obama Mr. Mitchell thinking one move board. The president went public demand full freeze settlements securing Israel's commitment. And aides apparently plan would Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said no. Most important, allowed controversy obscure real goal: nudging Israel Palestinians peace talks. (We don't know exactly happened told Mr. Obama relied judgment political advisers â€” specifically chief staff, Rehm Emanuel -- Mideast specialists.) The idea made sense: side something tangible prove serious peace start negotiations. But Mr. Netanyahu refused total freeze, President Obama backed down. Mr. Netanyahu since offered compromise 10-month freeze exempts Jerusalem, schools synagogues permits Israel complete 3,000 housing units already construction. The irony offer goes beyond past Israeli governments accepted, Mr. Obama called more. And Palestinians promptly rejected compromise. Washington isn't one blow it. After pushing President Obama lead peace effort, Arab states, especially Saudi Arabia, refused make concessions settlements halted. Mr. Mitchell asking allow Israel fly commercial planes Arab airspace open trade office. They also done far little strengthen Mr. Abbas, weak leader still best hope negotiating peace deal. Ditto Washington Israel. All raises two questions: What President Obama learned experience improve diplomatic performance generally? And plan revive peace talks? The president choice keep trying. At point extremists try provoke another war. absence dialogue make things worse. Advancing final-status plan two-state solution one high-risk way forward think worth gamble. Stalemate unsustainable.
