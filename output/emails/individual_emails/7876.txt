Last year, friend mine invited Hanukkah party Obamas gave prominent Jews (a group tensions), Obamas descended grand stairway, stood foyer briefly; President made remarks shook hands, back stairs went. No mingling. In first two years, Obamas seemed bit tone-deaf: many vacations people hurting, especially Michelle's extravagant trip Spain. (I'm interested Michelle's clothes next woman time think staff focused looking smashing, does. Her wardrobe seems quite extensive troubled times.) Barack Obama's personality much mulled past two years, seems inescapable high self- esteem often slides thin line arrogance, trickles (with exceptions) much staff, downright rude chosen few. °barna seemed uninterested anyone immediate group, three four members immediate circle--Jarrett, Robert Gibbs, David Axelrod—had experience governing. The fourth, Rahm Emanuel, expressed flippancy, arrogance, overuse F-word offended members Congress also would-be allies President. Vice President Joe Bider), liked Capitol Hill, virtually shut dealings people Congress first two years—"I handle them," Obama told Biden—but Biden expected given larger role part White House's new determination "reach out." (A months ago highly placed members staff also swore would "reach out," seemed last days.) One oddest aspects Obama's persona someone seems confident insisted thus far people around said "comfortable." For example, Torn Donilon, recently appointed national security adviser (a promotion role deputy), accounts capable man one's idea serious strategic thinker. The explanation I given Donilon's given new position "the President comfortable him." Just Obama described pleased himself, treated hero worship much staff. After all, taken formidable Clintons, and, expectation almost pundits experts, beaten them. Why listen doubted him? A common complaint Obama White House first two years "grown-ups" around, people knew governing would tell Obama wrong. When people tried suggest someone brought in, person rejected "not one ours." Joe Biden said argue Obama issues, Afghanistan, get management White House.... Those supported Obama 2008 expected able move public opinion, get people follow him. The fact Obama White House poor "messaging" baffles even strongest supporters. In fact, overall message. As Winston Churchill put it, theme pudding. When I asked White House aide this, pointed billed "major speech economy," Georgetown University April 2009. But speech utterly forgettable—and forgotten. One ally attributes problem inexperience Obama top staff. An ally says, "You can't leave message don't strategy don't know you're going." Another says, "They something worked campaign didn't work White House." Thus, Obama didn't see need explain doing. His 2010 campaign themes seemed wander place: Stanley Greenberg, pollster former aide Bill Clinton, said Obama's oft-used theme, shouldn't go back Bush days, actually tested negatively, people didn't believe country making economic, progress. So Obama's biggest failure leader many expected be. The jubilation surrounded swearing-in may gone head, celebrants overlooked plenty people overjoyed advent black president, even Democrat. Obama was, apparently estimation, smart adored seems felt need explain—and explain again—to country take country along him. This failure put programs across came times 2010 campaign.... More once, people town hall meetings told behind great trouble trying defend explain agenda. In backyard gathering October 21 made awkward reply I heard: "Our attitude get policies right didn't always think making sure got advertising properly going on." Advertising. (When I mentioned Democratic senator generally supportive Obama, ordinarily polite man responded, "Bullocks! What policies?") The risk-averse Obama left Congress write big bills economic stimulus health care (with strong participation White House aides). But kept line defense way pathetic press conference day election. In comments, Obama gave away devastating fact didn't really understand role president leader. A friend Obama administration said me, "Their definition governing passing bills." Someone else relatively close White House explained since Obama criticized "arrogant" "aloof," eat large portions humble pie. ("And I take responsibility that," Obama said again.)
