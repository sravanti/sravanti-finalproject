On another note, sad Smith Bagley. He good person one biggest fans. Women work We it! Dec 30th 2009 From The Economist print edition The rich world's quiet revolution: women gradually taking workplace Getty Images AT A time world short causes celebration, candidate: within next months women cross 50% threshold become majority American workforce. Women already make majority university graduates OECD countries majority professional workers several rich countries, including United States. Women run many world's great companies, PepsiCo America Areva France. Women's economic empowerment arguably biggest social change times. Just generation ago, women largely confined repetitive, menial jobs. They routinely subjected casual sexism expected abandon careers married children. Today running organisations treated second-class citizens. Millions women given control lives. And millions brains put productive use. Societies try resist trend—most notably Arab countries, also Japan southern European countries—will pay heavy price form wasted talent frustrated citizens. This revolution achieved modicum friction (see article). Men have, large, welcomed women's invasion workplace. Yet even positive changes incomplete unsatisfactory. This particular advance comes two stings. The first women still under- represented top companies. Only 2% bosses America's largest companies 5% peers Britain women. They also paid significantly less men average. The second juggling work child-rearing difficult. Middle-class couples routinely complain little time children. But biggest losers poor children— particularly places like America Britain combined high levels female participation labour force reluctance spend public money child care. Dealing juggle These two problems closely related. Many women feel choose children careers. Women prosper high-pressure companies 20s drop dramatic numbers 30s find almost impossible regain earlier momentum. Less-skilled women trapped poorly paid jobs hand-to-mouth child-care arrangements. Motherhood, sexism, issue: America, childless women earn almost much men, mothers earn significantly less. And mothers' relative poverty also disadvantages children. Demand female brains helping alleviate problems. Even new theories warm-hearted women making inherently superior workers bunk (see article), several trends favour educated sex, including "war talent" growing flexibility workplace. Law firms, consultancies banks rethinking "up out" promotion systems losing many able women. More 90% companies Germany Sweden allow flexible working. And new technology making easier redesign work sorts family-friendly ways. Women certainly performed better past decade men. In European Union women filled 6m 8m new jobs created since 2000. In America three four people thrown work since "mancession" began male. And shift towards women likely continue: 2011 2.6m female male university students America. The light hand state All argues, mostly, letting market work. That stopped calls hefty state intervention Scandinavian sort. Norway used threats quotas dramatic effect. Some 40% legislators women. All Scandinavian countries provide plenty state-financed nurseries. They highest levels female employment world far fewer social problems plague Britain America. Surely, comes argument, way speed revolution—and improve tough lives many working women children? If means massive intervention, shape affirmative-action programmes across-the-board benefits parents sorts, answer no. To begin with, promoting people basis sex illiberal unfair, stigmatises beneficiaries. And practical problems. Lengthy periods paid maternity leave put firms hiring women, helps explain Swedish women work public sector Sweden lower proportion women management America does. But plenty cheaper, subtler ways governments make life easier women. Welfare states designed women stayed home. They need change way operate. German schools, instance, close midday. American schools shut two months summer. These things changed without huge cost. Some popular American charter schools offer longer school days shorter summer holidays. And, without going Scandinavian lengths, America could invest children: spends lower share GDP public child-care almost rich country, rich country refuses provide mothers paid maternity leave. Barack Obama needs measure campaign rhetoric "real family values". Still, nagging problems overshadow dramatic progress women made recent decades. During second world war, America's menfolk front, government summon image Rosie Riveter, flexed muscle "We Can Do It" slogan, encourage women workforce. Today women marching workplace ever larger numbers taking sledgehammer remaining glass ceilings.
