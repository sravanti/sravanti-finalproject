Sid raw Westen Psychologist neuroscientist; Emory University Professor Posted: October 8, 2010 09:23 AM dJnLM L , -. -1.117.=1MIC2VAILISIrie ll=a===.1 According news reports, today Republican minority leader Coppertone model John Boehner give "closing argument" American people throw Democrats kill Obama-Pelosi-Reid "job- killing agenda." He returning working class roots, speaking piping manufacturing plant, unusual venue days man seen much frequently gatherings Wall Street executives open checkbooks males-only country club works tan making rounds clubs industry lobbyists. Either Speaker-to-be following model Michael Steele free-lancing, Karl Rove Republicans believe safe even advantageous bring public White House made effort put Boehner's face Republican majority might look like, president invoking name eight times one speech. I admit time I agnostic whether made sense try brand late date, Boehner minimal name recognition among voters. But White House doubt responding three realities. First, Boehner unknown Americans, means that, unlike Republicans news, well branded GOP -- means Democrats might actually brand someone something first rather playing catch-up. Second, Boehner would indeed highest-ranking Republican GOP assume control House (other course Karl Rove, directing traffic right side street Washington again). And third, concrete face always better abstraction telling story, perhaps Sarah Palin, Republicans could alternately accept decline leader party, Boehner's tanned visage history errand-boy virtually every major corporate special interest two decades Washington (including stint Marlboro Man, handing tobacco lobby campaign checks fellow Republicans floor House) made potential counter-villain Republican's bogeywoman, Nancy Pelosi. I remained agnostic week, colleagues Media Matters Action Network I conducted national 5urye:y 1,000 registered voters, selected match demographics voting likely voting populations. The goal see effectively could speak voters Boehner symbol standard-bearer GOP also water-boy corporate America. (The results surprisingly similar whether looked registered voters likely voters, although others described, precisely determine "likely voter" election much art science, point good messaging point actually change dynamics likely voting, reflect them.) As detailed memo published Politico, found clear: Boehner target well worth defining, readily stands precisely Americans perceive reasons would hold noses vote Congressional Republicans (perhaps group left poll worse Congressional Democrats swing voters). We tested paragraph-length narratives single-sentence language designed capture essence narratives, case, tested toughest opposition language could test against: words Boehner, Cantor, Limbaugh others combined defining "Obama-Pelosi-Reid" agenda. What found, brief: could beat tough GOP narrative "job-killing" socialists White House Congress 15 20 points two narratives starring Boehner leading role (with best supporting bad actor going one narratives Karl Rove corporate allies), could win 15 different sentence-long descriptions "what's matter Boehner" margins ranging 10 60 points tough conservative attack Obama-Pelosi-Reid axis conservative evil. The narratives moved likely voters -- including swing voters, preferred double-digits tough Republican rhetoric -- made clear whose voices Boehner would speaking Speaker (e.g., Wall Street executives convened try block Wall Street reform). They harnessed populist anger hijacking Washington corporate special interests enlivened tea partiers palpable across political spectrum, focused extremism party Boehner would Speak for. A narrative brought Karl Rove picture slightly polarizing swing voters slightly powerful likely Democratic voters. In ways surprising success single-line statements need Speaker John Boehner really speaks (although single-line statements came narratives, likely reflect power branding, even course brief online encounter voters). They ranged relatively lofty aspirational (e.g., "We need Speaker also listener, hear voices ordinary Americans" -- theme colleagues I found highly resonant across political spectrum message testing role money politics) -- harder-edged (e.g., "The Speaker House heartbeat away Presidency. Unfortunately, know John Boehner's heart is, isn't middle class," "John Boehner understands deficits. He's spent nearly 20 years Washington creating them.") If there's message message research, short-term long-term. In short run, Democrats want hang onto seats November, would well define election terms middle class small business versus billionaires big corporations hijacking democracy; use Boehner poster child party whose primary commitment latter whose tan testament commitment; avoid giving voters reason regret vote give Democrats time, supporting things say stand avoiding golden mean public interest special interests finance campaigns sides aisle. In longer run, branding matters. One biggest strategic messaging mistakes last two years failure Democrats brand opponents opponents busy branding -- particular failure brand Bush Recession natural consequence faded Republican economic principles. Two years ago, virtually uncontested political proposition, voters made clear handing Democrats White House supermajorities House Senate. Today, public split middle caused recession. Reality doesn't brand itself. Hopefully won't take debacle November another 10 million jobs lost reality unveil brief political moment progressives second bite apple.
