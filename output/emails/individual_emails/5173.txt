From battlefields Vietnam hills Western Pennsylvania halls Congress, Jack Murtha lived Marine Corps credo "Semper Fidelis," never wavering faithful commitment country loved men women bravely defend her. In war peace, fought knew right, even unpopular. He fierce advocate working families struggling changing economy better health care equipment servicemembers. And course three decades Congress, became one nation's respected voices national security foreign policy. Presidents parties sought advice generations colleagues looked leadership wisdom. As Senator New York serving Armed Services Committee, I fortunate call Jack friend mentor. And Secretary State, I continued rely expertise judgment. I knew Jack would always shoot straight, like Marine was, never shy away difficult question tough fight. Today country lost decorated war hero distinguished public servant. The men women armed forces lost tireless champion. And people Pennsylvania's 12th district lost neighbor, advocate, true friend. My thoughts prayers Jack's beloved wife Joyce family. He sorely missed.
