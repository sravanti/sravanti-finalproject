Hillary: This provocative significant analysis come recent election. Its author right-wing Republican lawyer based Richmond also writes column Human Events. I disagree ideological partisan undercurrent piece, especially overemphasis deficit overriding political factor rather administration's lack achievable results far improving living standards ordinary people. There reason deficit shouldn't become merely abstract factor actual benefits delivered. The pattern past deficit, talisman Hoover Republicans, moves partisan Republicans Democrats ascend economy progressing, gains widely spread new social programs favorable universal impact. That happening now. This analysis, therefore, may portentous. Worth reading. The electoral maps VA don't show email described. Sid Return Article November 13, 2009 Can Clinton Coalition Survive Obama? By Sean Trende John Judis Ruy Teixeira's well-regarded 2002 work The Emerging Democratic Majority begins vignette set Virginia. They tell story telecom executive named Mark Warner, runs moderate campaign appeals upper-middle class suburbanites working class rural voters, manages put together winning coalition that, imitated states, might put Democrats power decades come. Democrats build coalitions similar Warner's, fact better part decade. Warner's coalition essentially Bill Clinton's 1996 coalition. The coalition brand Clinton built extraordinarily successful one Democrats, breaking momentum resurgent GOP 1996, ultimately enabling election liberal President American History last year. Given background, it's appropriate first tangible sign coalition coming unglued come Virginia. Republican Bob McDonnell won governorship almost 59% vote — highest percentage (though highest victory margin) governor since 1961. The entire Republican ticket won similar margins, GOP picked six seats General Assembly. It could even worse — five Democrats won Assembly races fewer 1,000 votes. There superficial lessons drawn here. After last week's election, it's silly argue GOP brand damaged take advantage Democratic weakness. And Democrats' latest spin — weakness among Independents simply function Republicans calling independents retaining Republican voting habits — puts lie argument Republicans' low self-identification salient factor elections. But important lesson this: there's little predictive value off-year elections, provide snapshots mood electorate, present state political coalitions. Given Virginia's primacy story Democratic coalition building, gives us good snapshot state coalition. And it's pretty one Democrats. The historical base Democratic Party two centuries long Jay Cost I call Jacksonians: Culturally conservative, hawkish, populist whites located throughout South Border states. They began breaking away Democrats 1950s 1960s — reaction Party's embrace unions, blacks liberals story well known there's need rehash here. But group remained least play Democrats. Clinton inherited coalition consisting minorities, liberals, urban voters, decent remnant Jacksonian voters Ohio River Valley South, still preferred moderate-to-conservative Democrat Republican. This coalition became majority coalition Clinton used combination fiscal conservatism social moderation bring suburban voters board. This huge innovation Democrats; suburbs like Nassau County, NY, Orange County, CA Fairfax County, VA fueled rise Republican parties states. Clinton moved substantially toward side. This coalition allowed win eight points 1996; absent Perot last-minute fundraising scandal, probably would won more. Clinton intuited suburban voters are, generally speaking, culturally cosmopolitan — don't like call someone "macaca," aren't crazy religious right. But they're generally particularly socially liberal either, fans "law order." They like taxes low appreciate economic growth, like good schools clean environment. Having balance bunch spending priorities somewhat limited income daily lives, balanced budgets ultimate "good government" indicator voters. Clinton delivered issues, keeping tax increases fairly small, balancing budget much term. In — important — re-branded Democrats party fiscal responsibility, economic growth, moderate taxes, smart government. In words, finally shed "Carter" label Democrats. This, turn, made plausible much liberal heirs benefit presumption competence Democrats - one probably would enjoyed without him. George W. Bush's presidency, turn, upper-middle class suburbanite's nightmare. An aggressive social agenda, fiscal trainwreck, two poorly-managed wars financial collapse later, suburban voters trended even heavily Democratic Clinton era. By 2008, Democrats held suburban districts around , major metropolitan areas, threatening exurbs. The right Democratic candidate probably could put together massive 2008 Presidential majority, combining minorities, liberals, Jacksonians, Catholics, suburbanites. The mood country certainly right 1920/1932/1952/1980 result. But Democrats nominated Barack Obama. The party's grip among Jacksonians weakened since Clinton left stage, abandoned Obama completely. Jay Cost I detailed here. This movement Obama received 53% vote, instead 60% might expect given voters' attitude toward Bush's Presidency. Obama able win even without branch Democratic party generated intensity among remaining portions base. In words, base wasn't broad Clinton's, deeper. Faced vanishing 401ks home values, disgust Bush's presidency, suburbanites flocked him. Liberals enthralled finally elect one own. And minorities turned heavily opportunity elect first black President. But presents problem. You get elect first black President once, governing coalition suburbanites, poor blacks, upper class liberals isn't easy. It hard keep enthusiasm up. And Jacksonian wing party gone, enthusiasm dissipates, one coalition groups becomes disgruntled starts shuffle door, party isn't left much. We see microcosm story last Tuesday's elections, especially Virginia. Let's backtrack 2001, look counties Mark Warner won. The coalition Warner built similar Clinton's. To oversimplify some, blended together rural Democrats mining counties west state, college voters around Charlottesville, black voters combined rural whites south central southeastern portion state suburban voters northeast. It diverse coalition, worked. Now let's compare Warner's map Obama's map 2008: The suburbs stayed Democrat's camp, reasons discussed above. But look happens west! That area becomes solidly Republican. Buchanan Dickenson counties Virginia panhandle voted Dukakis, Mondale, Adlai Stevenson (twice). Obama became second Democrat lose counties since UMW moved 1920s. As I said, isn't problem long (1) Jacksonians show willingness come back candidate Obama and/or (2) suburbs continue love affair Democrats. But see indications Virginia Jacksonian divorce may, fact, permanent. Creigh Deeds western section state, seemed — least paper — capable remaking Mark Warner map. It didn't happen, obviously. Let's look Virginia changed Bush's 2000 election Deeds' loss last week: The redder county is, moved toward Republicans 2000 2009; bluer counties moved toward Democrats. We see McDonnell well Bush suburbs — better. Those pockets white DC suburbs northeast, Hampton Roads area southeast, Richmond north west Hampton Roads. Its rural Virginia — still 1/3 electorate — made difference Bush's 54% 2004 McDonnell's 59% Tuesday. Even Obama ticket, much less cosmopolitan figure atop ticket, rural Virginia went solidly Republican. We take another angle here. Deeds McDonnell squared close Attorney General race 2005. Let's compare Deeds' 2005 showing 2009 performance. [NOTE: In map, look "relative movement." Because everything state moved toward McDonnell, map showing "movement" would solid dark red, much use. So instead, something moved 9 points toward McDonnell, colored shade red, moved less 9 points toward McDonnell, blue. Think showing change counties' PVI]. We see result. Just since 2005, rural Virginia moved sharply Democrats. The suburbs haven't moved much all, relative rest state, heavily African American counties southern portion state moved notches leftward (in absolute terms, voted 2009 2005). This suggests lasting damage Democratic brand simply personal Obama. Now let's look McDonnell compared McCain 2008. Again, movement dramatic statewide, need isolate biggest smallest changes looking "relative" shifts. The western counties state didn't shift much 2008, that's already giving Republicans around 70% vote — wasn't much room Republican growth (and remember, "blue" relative map still means slight movement toward Republican since 2008)! The real Republican gains past year come DC exurbs, 1-95 corridor, lesser extent Hampton Roads area. In words, Jacksonians aren't returning Democrats, least Virginia. Deeds might still able win without them, Democrats also showing weakness Virginia suburbs. In words, two pieces Clinton-Warner coalition starting break away. This real problem Democrats. If suburbanites Jacksonians move away party, very, little left them. And there's reason think suburban weakness real. Obama's fiscal policy, make understatement, hasn't Clintonian. It may entirely fault, $787 billion stimulus, trillion dollar healthcare bill, automobile bailout, budget showing trillion dollar deficits extending next decade make suburbanites shudder. They don't much like debt, intuit spending going paid point — probably them. Voters still give Obama benefit doubt, Presidents first year, becoming very, worried, probably don't put much stock Candidate Obama's promise enact net spending cut more. Democrats doubtless chalk Creigh Deeds' inept campaign. Deeds wasn't great candidate, mood country starting swing party, hard run good campaign. Jerry Kilgore found ran similar environment 2005, reduced attacking Tim Kaine religious views death penalty. And run Deeds-McDonnell race 2006 2008, I think hard argue McDonnell would win 18 points, even holding everything else equal. The problem explanation saw similar results replicated around country. Most seats House Delegates Democrats lost Virginia, came close losing, suburban. The Philly suburbs voted Republican state Supreme Court. Bergen County New Jersey didn't give Republican 60% vote like 1984, Chris Christie nearly carried it, even though significantly conservative Christie Todd Whitman Tom Kean, won largest margin first-term Republican Governor since 1969. Conservative Republicans won elections Westchester County, New York, Republicans picked two City Council seats outskirts Queens. Republicans won back Nassau County legislature -- Democrats' capture body figures prominently introduction Emerging Democratic Majority -- nearly defeated Democratic County Executive obscure, underfunded candidate. In words, places never heard Creigh Deeds seen attack ads McDonell's thesis, Democrats still lost suburban voters. States Democratic base liberals, urbanites, minority voters -- like California New York -- haven't moved much Democrats. Obama's polling numbers, well Democratic candidates Governor Senator, classic "Emerging Democratic Majority" states like Colorado Nevada looking good all. And course Jacksonian states like Kentucky, he's 40%. This doesn't mean Democrats doomed 2010. An improved economy, Republican missteps, host factors could keep band together them. Maybe marginal voters Obama brought polls enact hope change return 2010 keep hope alive. But personal nature Obama's victory starting show downside downticket Democrats. The Clinton coalition looking creaky. If Obama doesn't improve coalition comes apart, Democrats could find weaker even 1980s 1990s. Sean Trende reached strende@realclearpolitics.com.
