Rage 1:1 Days Rage -- The Noxious Transformation Conservative Movement Rabid Fringe By Max Blumenthal, Nation Books Posted August 10, 2010, Printed August 17, 2010 http://www.alternet.orgistory/147784/ Editor's Note: The following new epilogue Max Blumenthal's book, Republic Gomorrah, paperback (Basic/Nation Books, 2009). "He tell wants strong authority take crushing responsibility thinking Since Republic weak, led break law love obedience. But really strong authority wishes? In reality demands rigorous order others, disorder without responsibility." -- Jean-Paul Sartre, "Anti-Semite Jew" I sure I first detected noxious fumes would envelop conservative movement Obama era. It might early on, April 2009, I visited series gun shows rural California Nevada. Perusing tables piled high high- caliber semi-automatic weapons chatting anyone vicinity, I heard urgent warnings mass roundups, concentration camps, socialist government Washington. "These people purchasing guns people worried what's going country," gun dealer told outside show Reno. "Good luck Obama," young gun enthusiast remarked me. "We outnumber 100 1." At time, Tea Party movement even registered national media's radar. In September 2009, I led panel discussion book inside auditorium filled nearly 100 students faculty University California- Riverside. Beside sat Jonathan Walton, African-American professor religious studies prolific writer, Mark Takano, erudite, openly gay former Democratic congressional candidate local community college trustee. In middle discussion, dozen College Republicans stormed front stage signs denouncing "left-wing hack" hysterical young man leaped crowd, blowing kisses mockingly Takano heckling Walton "racist." Afterward, university police officers insisted escorting ride right-wing heckler attempted follow shouted threats. Who stalker? Just concerned citizen worried taxes? His name Ryan Sorba operative heavily funded national conservative youth outfit, Intercollegiate Studies Institute. Besides founding dozens Republican youth groups across country, Sorba devoted exceptional amount energy interest homosexuals. His intellectual output consists tract titled The Born Gay Hoax, arguing homosexuality curable disease bogus trend manufactured academic leftists. Adding credentials, Sorba history run-ins law, explained I called order. My encounter aggressive right-wing cadre seemed strange, isolated event. But hostility turned symptomatic intensifying campaign delegitimize President Obama allies Congress. The Right's days rage beginning. Through first year office, Obama seemed oblivious threat far right. He campaigned partisanship, declaring "no red states" "conservative America." Apparently, thought merely contrivance myth people rejected science, demonized gays, assailed minority women's rights -- genuinely believed said. Speaking changing Washington, Obama seemed think entire history politics since rise Reagan Right strategies polarization deeply rooted superficial problem attributable certain "divisive" personalities, easily wiped away gestures toward bipartisanship. His view parties simply mirror images sharing fundamental beliefs separated "partisans." The skilled devoted community organizer could bring together. Many supporters media, often part parcel political wars years, reinforced amplified innocence, proclaiming one last could "bridgeâ€¢ partisan divide." Andrew Sullivan, disaffected conservative called critics George W. Bush policies "fifth columnists" fervently supporting Obama, wrote new president destined become "a liberal Reagan reunite America." This optimism pervaded Obama White House president aides sought Republicans willing vote programs. After all, couldn't get along? In autobiographical book The Audacity Hope, Obama highlighted key component political strategy: "I serve blank screen people vastly different political stripes project views." Once elected, conservatives concluded could reverse Obama's strength transforming human tableau fearsome images could conjure. Obama's multiracial background crucial cultivating resentment among shock troops. Those rejected Obama's legitimacy serve president basis background gave birth "Birther" movement sought challenge citizenship. The movement's visible figure, therefore eccentric, Orly Taitz, dentist self- trained lawyer immigrated former Soviet republican Moldova Israel settling conservative bastion Orange County, California. Convinced claims far-right Web site WorldNetDaily Obama planned create "civilian national security force," Taitz told "realized Obama another Stalin--it's cross Stalinist USSR Hitler's Germany." After becoming transfixed online conspiracy theories claiming Obama's family forged birth certificate Hawaii, Taitz snapped action. She filed lawsuit November 2008 California Secretary State Debra Bowen demanding investigation Obama's eligibility serve president. Taitz's plaintiff case Wiley Drake, Orange County radio preacher former second vice president Southern Baptist Convention publicly prayed Obama's death. While lawsuit went nowhere, subsequent suits earned angry rebukes judges, Taitz became instant media sensation, delivering heavily accented screeds Obama friendly interviewers Sean Haimity CNN's Lou Dobbs, Taitz called "greatest supporter" eventually fired indirect result hosting her. In March 2009, Texas Rep. Randy Neugebauer signed Birther bill proposing future presidential candidates must prove citizenship becoming eligible campaign. The Birther movement found voice goverment made indelible impact Republican grassroots. By June 2009, 28 percent Republican respondents Kos/Research 2000 poll said thought Obama wasn't born United States, 30 percent "weren't sure." "Obama Big House," Taitz shrieked me, "not White House!" When Obama announced health care reform first major initiative administration, conservative movement activated campaign demonization -- transformational politics -- designed turn Obama "Other," making seem unfamiliar, therefore threatening, possible. When president urged Congress deliver health care reform bill 2009, Right staged living theater political hatred, Obama's dream bipartisanship transformed nightmarish version "Marat/Sade." On September 12, 2009, tens thousands far-right activists belonging loose confederation anti-government groups called Tea Party Patriots converged Washington's National Mall giant protest Obama health care plan. The date significant: Fox News's top- ranked talk show host Glenn Beck declared birth "9-12 Project" restore sense unity -- siege mentality -- Americans experienced September 11, 2001. But time, Obama -- Osama -- enemy. While covering rally, I witnessed sign sign declaring Obama greater danger America's security al- Qaida; demonstrators held images juxtaposed Obama's face images evildoers Hitler Pol Pot Bin Laden; others carried signs questioning Obama's status U.S. citizen. "We fight al-Qaida, can't kill Obama," said aging demonstrator. Another told me, "Obama biggest Nazi world," pointing placards fashioned depicting Obama House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi SS outfits. According another activist, Obama's agenda similar Hitler's: "Hitler took banking industry, not? And Hitler personal secret service police. [The community- organizing group] ACORN extension that." The seemingly incongruous Tea Party propaganda recalled signs waved right-wing Jewish settlers rallies Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin support peace process, portraying SS officer French collaborator Marshall Petain. In 1995, amid provocative atmosphere, young right-wing Jewish zealot assassinated Rabin. The Israeli tragedy cautionary example targeted hatred leading violence. Members Tea Party "Patriots" seem care rhetoric irrational, comparing Obama Hitler Stalin contradictory obviously hyperbolic. Their motives entirely negative. By purging government multicultural evil seized power illicit means (several activists told believed ACORN helped Obama steal election), convinced mythical golden American yesteryear would return. They interest building anything new even articulating agenda, much less discussing merits policies. The Tea Party's primary concern cultural purification -- freedom from, freedom to. Against dark image president liberal allies, Tea Party activists defined children light. The racial subtext always transparent. The Tea Party's strategy rested guerrilla campaign chaos sabotage designed intimidate Democrats also disorient independent voters might supported health care reform. The Tea Partiers convinced would easy feat, since believed majority country side -- represented "Real America." At 9-12 rally Matt Kibbe, one march organizers, told crowd ABC News reporting 1 million 1.5 million people attendance, something ABC denied, saying "ABCNews.com reported approximate figure 60,000 70,000 protesters." Then Armey led crowd chant "Freedom works! Freedom works!" Unknown Tea Partiers, intoning name corporate-funded Beltway advocacy group, battle cry Mel Gibson William Wallace Braveheart. Contrary image grassroots movement mobilized stifle machinations Washington elites, Tea Party movement creation constellation industry-funded conservative groups close Republican ties. The movement's leading puppet-master Dick Armey, directed resources talking points Tea Party "Patriots" Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group, FreedomWorks. Among corporate clients Armey's lobbying firm, forced leave result involvement Tea Parties, pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb, company clear interest defeating health care reform. (Armey's "real American" clients included Marxist terror cult, People's Mojahedin Iran, received funding assistance Saddam Hussein order launch terrorist strikes throughout 1990's Iranian civilian targets.) Armey collected consulting fee $250,000 directly FreedomWorks $300,000 allied astroturf front groups. FreedomWorks paid much money assortment Republican political consultants. If Armey Tea Party king, Sarah PalM eager crowned Tea Party queen. Just days Obama's inauguration, Palin abruptly quit job Alaskan governor vie honor. PalM's motives quitting became clear inked lucrative deal write political memoir Going Rogue, signed regular contributor Fox News, received $1 million episode reality show cable television, "Sarah Palin's Alaska." PalM's book tour, sent Middle America luxuriously outfitted bus, resembled presidential campaign traveling carnival. Whether PalM intends run president, growing media presence magnified influence within Republican Party. Yet ever-expanding Palin phenomenon greeted hostility Republican politicos desperately seeking expand party's base drubbing 2008. Former McCain campaign manager Steve Schmidt warned Palin's nomination 2012 would "catastrophic" GOP. His doomsday prediction backed October Gallup poll revealing one polarizing unpopular political figures country disapproval rating 50 percent. Unfortunately Schmidt party pragmatists, approve Palin represent heartbeat Republican Party, fervent activists, cannot dissuaded following her, even leading party cliff. A November 2009 special congressional election New York's heavily Republican 23rd district first major test Palin's power. Along parade nationally recognized conservatives, Palin endorsed Doug Hoffman, unknown far- right third-party candidate closely allied Tea Party, helping force popular moderate Republican politician, Dede Scozzafava, race. In end, Palin's ideological purge upstate New York led improbable Democratic victory, first district 100 years. After disaster Palin allies claimed victory, insisting least hastened purge ideologically impure Republicans party. She went endorse Rand Paul, son right-wing libertarian Rep. Ron Paul candidate Kentucky's GOP senatorial primary, Dick Cheney went way endorse Rand's regular Republican opponent, Trey Grayson, Kentucky secretary state. Following Tea Party script avoiding social issues like abortion gay marriage order obscure large presence Christian Right within movement's ranks, self-described "hardcore pro- lifer" Palin recast libertarian concerned primarily issues "economic freedom." She claimed Democratic "cap trade" plan limit carbon emissions would harm livelihood blue-collar workers, assailed health care reform Trojan Horse "socialism" (though admitted family "used hustle border" take advantage Canada's single-payer health care system). But Palin attack much effect one blasted Facebook page claiming Obama health care plan included provision "death panels" would recommend euthanasia severely ill patients like Down syndrome-afflicted son, Trig. With click button, Palin transformed tone health care debate rancorous poisonous. The source Palin's "death panels" smear practiced propagandist, former New York Lieutenant Governor Betsy McCaughey. When President Bill Clinton introduced health care reform first term, McCaughey falsely claimed article published New Republic widely circulated Republicans, plan would force consumers drop private plans buy government's program (the article would go win National Magazine Award retracted years later New Republic's editors). Now back spotlight, pushing rumor would voted non-partisan fact-checking Web site Politifact.com "the lie 2009." McCaughey's latest innuendo boosted cult political crank Lyndon LaRouche, mobilized push rumor mainstream. In June 2009, one LaRouche's top lieutenants publicly confronted Ezekiel Emanuel, National Institute Health's chief bioethicist brother White House chief staff Rahm Emanuel, accusing seeking reintroduce Hitler's T- 4 program kill handicapped health care reform. "President Obama put place reform apparatus reviving euthanasia Hitler Germany 1939, began genocide there," LaRouche staffer Anton Chaitkin charged. Soon, LaRouche's followers street corners around country posters depicting Obama Hitler moustache. At town hall forum health care reform hosted Democratic Rep. Barney Frank, LaRouche follower waved one Obama-as-Hitler posters demanded, "Why continue support Nazi policy, Obama expressly supported policy?" Two months later, Palin whispered rumor Facebook, prominent conservatives former Speaker House Newt Gingrich ranking Senate Finance Committee member Charles Grassley parroted claims audiences indignant Tea Partiers. Not outdone, Glenn Beck devoted extended rant show reality death panels. Echoing LaRouche cultists, Beck accused Ezekiel Emanuel "the devaluing human life, putting price individual." He thundered, "The death panel firing squad. Rationing inevitable know it!" The death panel rumor served variety functions, useful movement, necessarily Republican Party. Most importantly, rumor resonated hard-core libertarians resented existence federal government Christian Right activists viewed legalization abortion slippery slope government-sponsored euthanasia. The hysteria engendered helped repair rift exposed Terri Schiavo charade 2005, evangelical conservative James Dobson publicly clashed Armey, libertarian leader, right government interfere private family matter life death. The slurring Obama sort sleeper agent crypto-Muslim helped bring neoconservatives back fray. The new neo- con generation led Dick Cheney's daughter, Liz, founded anti-Obama advocacy group, Keep America Safe, leveraging donations pro- Israel sources. Asked CNN's Larry King Birther movement challenging Obama's status American citizen, Liz Cheney remarked, "One reasons see people concerned people uncomfortable first time ever, I think, president seems reluctant defend nation overseas." With libertarians, Christian Right, neo-cons seated around table, united resentment alien president, conservative movement whole again. The experiments "Terror Management Theory" Sheldon Solomon, professor psychology Skidmore College, Jeff Greenberg, professor psychologist Unviersity Arizona, Tom Pyszczynski, professor psychology University Colorado, demonstrated connection fear death intensification conservative attitudes. The findings help explain effectiveness death panel rumor insinuations conservative figures Obama truly American somehow sympathetic Islamic terrorists. Indeed, seemingly irrational smears guided tactical reasoning, calculated agitate voters constant reminders mortality. Whether Independents responded, rhetoric death kept Tea Party crowd persistent state panic rage, ensuring standing army ready fan rallies town halls first sign liberal malfeasance. Obama's first year office marked raucous protests; several disturbing murders committed far-right extremists. In April 2009, 22-year-old neo-Nazi wannabe named Richard Poplawsi mowed SWAT team Pittsburgh cops, killing three. Poplawski's best friend told reporters young killer "grew angry recently fears Obama would outlaw guns." Later discovered Poplawski posted video clip neo-Nazi Web site portraying Fox's Glenn Beck contemplating existence concentration camps. (After characteristically thorough investigation, Beck conceded real.) On another occasion, killer posted video promoting Tea Party rallies. A month Pittsburgh bloodbath, Scott Roeder, supporter militant anti- abortion group Operation Rescue, shot Dr. George Tiller death prayed church Wichita, Kansas. Tiller declared fair game anti- abortion movement role Kansas's late-term abortion provider. During least 28 episodes Bill O'Reilly's "O'Reilly Factor," O'Reilly referred Tiller "Tiller baby killer," criminal guilty "Nazi stuff." "I wouldn't want [Tiller] Judgment Day," O'Reilly proclaimed. In August 2009, middle-aged professional named George Sodini walked health club suburban Pittsburgh gunned three women. The mainstream press explained Sodini's motives away homing passages online diaries describing loneliness, inability convince women sex him, descent chronic masturbation. Nearly every major media outlet omitted ignored long deranged entry Sodini projected sexual frustration onto Obama, seemed view symbol black male virility predation. The day Obama's election victory, Sodini wrote: "Good luck Obama! He successful. The liberal media LOVES him. Amerika chosen The Black Man. Good! In light I got ideas outside Obama's plans economy such. Here is: Every black man get young white girl ... Kinda reverse indentured servitude thing. Every daddy know sends little girl college, ... real good. I saw it. 'Not little girl', daddy says! (Yeah right!!) Black dudes thier [sic] choice best white?? [ellipses original]." In another posting anti- Clinton forum 1994, height Republicans' Whitewater investigation, Sodini revealed purchased bumper sticker reading, "Stop Socialism, Impeach Clinton," National Review ad. A year later, Sodini ranted anti-government militia site, "I convinced drastic action required bring country back Constitutional order 200 years ago. I don't think group political leaders achieve us." Whether Sodini's murder spree motivated political passions, pathologically death-driven fixated phantasmagoria right-wing imagery. In final diary entry, Sodini proclaimed, "Death lives!" More media figure Obama era, Glenn Beck encouraged campaign racial demonization conspiracy consumed Tea Party "Patriots." During broadcast "Fox Friends," Beck opined Obama "has exposed guy deep-seated hatred white people, white culture." As evidence, Beck pointed White House green-jobs czar Van Jones, African American former community organizer eventually forced resign direct result Beck's crusade. From there, Beck targeted another black Obama adviser, Valerie Jarrett, highlighting ties ACORN upholding Jones evidence Obama's "socialist" agenda. In another broadcast, Beck played audio clip unidentified African Americans referring "Obama money" collected welfare checks Detroit. Then showed footage members Kansas City-based youth group practicing step show, traditional African-American group dance apparently unfamiliar enough Beck transfixed audience felt liberty claim footage evidence "Obama's SS" trained across inner- city America. In September 2009, Beck relentlessly targeted ACORN, Right's new favorite hobgoblin, admitting intended use poor people's advocacy group distract viewers health care debate. "Trust me," Beck said, "Everybody says they're going talking health care. I don't think so." (His statement reminiscent Rush Limbaugh's scandal- mongering remark early Clinton administration: "Whitewater health care.") Beck promptly cued series hidden camera videos shot conservative youth activists James O'Keefe Hannah Giles inside ACORN field offices. In videos, O'Keefe baited African-American staffers making statements explaining Giles, claimed prostitute, could obtain low-income housing. O'Keefe edited images clad outlandish pimp costume create impression dressed way meetings ACORN; however, Giles later admitted partner lied wearing costume farther ineriminate ACORN. In end. ACORN exonerated criminal wrongdoing separate incident O'Keefe arrested charged federal crime several conservative pals disguised telephone repairmen attempted wiretap phone lines office Senator Mary 'Landrieu Louisiana. Like Ryan Sorba, O'Keefe posse movement cadres paid directed well-funded conservative outfits; O'Keefe trained Leadership Institute, right-wing youth Froup nurtured leadinG, lights like Jack Abriunoff, Karl Rove, Ralph Reed, Jeff Gannon. While O'Keefe buddies plea-bargained prosecutors, Beck basked formula success. His show earned hithest ratings Fox News, topping network franchises like O'Reilly Sean Hannity. In process. Beck's opinions became firmly implanted nervous systems Tea Party activists. "Glenn Beck taught us everything know," demonstrator 9-12 rally told Me. "He's opened eyes much." But unlike right-wing radio warhorses helped usher Newt Gin<trich's Republican counter-revolution 1994, Beck authentic product movement. When Rush Limbaugh first began dominating AM airwaves, Beck mired world mid-level commercial radio, delivering corny yarns lesbians celebrity trash hopes becoming next Howard Stem. By night, tirelessly recounted, medicated anxiety cocaine alcohol, destroying first marriage process. "We remember Glenn womanizing, drinking, drugs. Everybody knew time saw a: complete mess was," shock jock Tampa, Florida, called Bubba Love Sponge remarked broadcast nationally syndicated show. Like Dusty Rhodes, pseudo- populist demagogue Elia Kazan's 1957 film, A Face Crowd. Beck self- destructive drifter Who might crumpled bottle Mad Dog 20/20 alleyway locked away ,a prison cell fame found first. Beck able stabilize life made escape freedom., marrying conservative Mormon, converting religion, transmuting urge abuse drugs conservative radio diatribes. When Beck first broke television On CNN's Headline News Channel, struggled articulate coherent political world view. If distinguished big-time conservative .hosts way, strained often snide attempts humor, remnants failed radio career. Nevertheless, help liberal agent, Matthew Hiltzik, Beck snagged primetime slot Fox News early 2009. Around time, Beck began promoting work arcane Mormon conspiracy-peddler named W. Clean Skousen, described political lodestar. Suddenly, Beck something offer irritable mental gestures. Thanks Beck's designation Skousen's pseudohistorical tract The 5000 Year Leap "required reading" Web site 9- 12 Project, promotion book show, previously obscure Skousen. became Hidden imam Tea Party movement. By summer 2009, Skousen's Leap among top 10 books Amazon.com fixture literature tables Tea Party gatherings. It went selling puny couple thousand copies 2007 selling 200,000 copies 2009. Just book generated instant appeal difficult understand. It little slapdash quotes Founding Fathers, often taken context deliberately oversimplified, explain America greatest nation history. process, Skousen claims church state separation un-American, "coercive taxation" communist, marriage underpinning free society. Benjamin Franklin., wrote length merits "amours" "old women," famously solicited prostitutes fathered son wedlock, ultimate authority Skousen quoted importance marriage. Though Skousen claims Founders world's foremost source eternal wisdom, buttressed points fringe sources like conspiracist Norman Dodd's screeds Illuminati. According. Skousen, Dodd claimed "powerful influences congregating United States" like Rockefellers Rothschilds forced United States World War I. Skousen published Dodd's manifestoes obscure journal Freemen's Digest, founded express purpose propagating conspiracies. Skousen's paranoid politics outgrowth participation. extreme anti-communist groups 1950s. He boasted close friendship then-FBI director J. Edgar Hoover said provided research communist plots, claims disputed FBI historians. (During recent interview. Skousen's son, Paul, told contrary rumors Hoover's cross-dressing homosexual dalliances, would set top cop blind dates live women.) Skousen fired job Salt Lake City's police chief for, words city's conservative Mormon mayor, "conduct[ing] hi.s office chief police exactly manner communists operate government." From there, Skousen sailed far shores Right-peddling conspiracy tracts like The Naked Communist-, earning condemnation beloved FBI, accused internal memo "promoting [his] anti-communism obvious financial purposes." Skousen's vocal support far-right John Birch Society's claim communists controlled President Dwight Eisenhower cost support corporate backers paid Red-bashing lecture tours. He went radar several years, returning late 1960s accuse Jewish Rothschild family secretly bankrolling everyone Ho Chi Minh civil rights. movement. By late 1970s, even Church Latter Day Saints distanced Skousen conspiracy theories. His work fell margins might disappeared entirely Beck revived it, turning The 5000 Year Leap bible Tea Party movement. Journalist Alexander Zaitchik observed authoritative profile Skousen Salon.com Skousen's renewed influence Beck Tea Party 'suggests modern base Republican Party headed strange place." Besides influencing Beck, Skousen's teachings inspired one Tea Party movement's visible grassroots celebrities, retired Sheriff Richard Mack. I met Mack February far- right rally outside Montgomery, Alabama. On makeshift stage towed middle rodeo arena pickup truck, Mack recalled reverence mentorship Skousen, said taught everything needed know Constitution. Mack urged spellbound audience stockpile ammo store food. "If control food supply," Mack warned, "you control people. And that's first step slavery." Already hero conservatives successfully suing Clinton administration provision Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act requiring law enforcement conduct criminal background checks gun purchasers, Mack reemerged Obama era archetypal local lawman vowed resist tyrannical federal government. Along dozen former active military law enforcement personnel, Mack helped form self-styled Tea Party militia called Oathkeepers. Galvanized fear creeping socialism, Oathkeepers solemnly swore refuse tyrannical federal orders cooperating foreign troops forcing Americans concentration camps. Because group's members trained combat, vow came suggestion armed resistance. Besides Mack, Oathkeepers attracted coterie militia movement retreads ranks. The well-established figure Mike Vanderboegh, longtime militia fanatic published booklet mid- 1990s entitled Strategy Tactics Militia Civil War, calling sniper attacks "war criminals, secret policemen, rats." With Obama office, Vandeboegh churned anti- government screeds right-wing blogs renewed passion supported efforts cashing $1,300 federal disability compensation received month. For energy far right exerted campaign strangle Obama's agenda, Democrat posed greatest threat passage health care reform. Representative Bart Stupak Michigan office since 1993, placing among senior leadership so-called centrist Blue Dog Democrats. When health care reform introduced Congress, Stupak became leader informal caucus anti-abortion Democrats, making de facto swing vote House version bill. By extension, Stupak point man campaign ensure bill would allow federal funding abortion low-income women. But close consultation leaders U.S. Conference Catholic Bishops, Stupak went step further. He introduced draconian amendment block women paying abortions even private insurance plans. The amendment, passed House shut Senate, became key sticking point health care negotiations. 'He's big hero pro-life community," former Bush Catholic issues adviser Deal Hudson told November 2009. "Thanks him, first time I remember pro-life Democrats power." To chagrin Republicans, Stupak entertained offers compromise Democratic leadership. According Hudson, Catholic Bishops keen see health care reform pass, bill contained clear provision forbidding patients spending federal money abortion. Finally, March, pressure House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Obam.a agreed sign executive order forbidding federal funding abortion. Stupak mollified. Now anti- abortion caucus pledged deliver swing votes Democrats needed pass bill. As soon reports seeped declaring imminent passage health care reform, major right-wing blogs like RedState.org churned virulent denunciations Stupak, calling traitor sellout. The blog comment sections filled dozens diatribes referring Stupak language previously reserved Dr. George Tiller: "Bart Baby-Killer." On March 20, thousands Tea Party activists surrounded Capitol's Longworth Building expectation Obama's pep talk House Democrats health care vote. Democratic Representative john Lewis, hero civil rights movement, Representative Barney Frank, first openly gay member Congress, passed crowd way inside Capitol. Thsligger!" demonstrator barked Lewis. Another called Frank "faggot," eliciting laughter cheers nearby protesters. Meanwhile, another African-American Democrat, Representative Emanuel Cleaver, ascended Capitol steps, protester screaming Lewis Frank spat face. With demonstration carried night, cries "Kill bill!'' drifted calls violence. "I would gladly stand men take fascists down," man camouflage battle dress uniform proclaimed front amateur videographer, pointing toward Capitol. "You haven't heard last me!" The next day, Republican members Congress emerged Longworth Building salute Tea Partiers. The demonstrators cheered wildly proxies inside. Finally, hours impassioned speeches House floor, bill passed. But drama hardly over. Republican Representative Joe Pitts, anti-abortion Catholic co-authored Stupak's original amendment, demanded motion bring back floor vote, transparent exercise grandstanding certain fail. In response, Stupak rushed podium stinging rebuke Pitts Republicans. "The motion commit support life," Stupak declared. "It Democrats stood up...." Heckling Republican side interrupted statement. As Stupak looked around House chamber, Rep. Randy Neugebauer, right-wing Republican Texas openly supported Birther movement, began shouting backbench, "Baby killer!" Other Republicans joined in, parroting base insults. While Republicans sank heads defeat, militant devotees Tea Party movement called right-wing Kristallnacht. "If wish send message Pelosi party cannot fail hear, break windows," Vanderboegh Oathkeepers wrote far-right blog hours bill passed. "Break NOW. Break run break again." Within three days, windows doors Democratic Party headquarters New York, Kansas Arizona shattered. Meanwhile, least 10 Democratic members Congress reported receiving death threats. Images nooses faxed offices Stupak James Clyburn, African-American congressman South Carolina. Representative Anthony Weiner, especially vocal proponent health care reform, received menacing letter filled white powder. The brother Representative Torn Perriello, another health care supporter, home gas line deliberately sabotaged local Tea Party organizer posted address online (he meant post congressman's) encouraged activists "drop by" express anger Perriello's recent vote. In Tucson, Arizona, windows Democratic Representative Gabrielle Giffbrds' office shattered shots pellet gun. And brick thrown window Representative Louise Slaughter's office New York voicemail filled threats impending sniper attacks. After Passage health care bill, Tea Party floated gray zone authoritarianism anarchy. Crusading restore holy social order, promoted disorder. Claiming protect democracy, smashed windows elected representatives. Warning death panels, called death threats. With atmosphere violence thickening, Palin took Twitter account issue battle cry: "Don't Retreat, Insteadâ€”RELOAD!" Thus concluded first phase Obama era usher peaceable kingdom bipartisanship.
