The clique conservatives operated since Iran-Contra scandal held key policy offices George W. Bush administration waging war Obama part Sen. Jim DeMint South Carolina. A freshman Foreign Relations Committee previously known expertise Latin America, DeMint best known boasting health care would "Waterloo" "break" Obama. He recently provoked nasty spat within committee requesting funding travel Honduras "assess" crisis. The Obama administration favors reinstalling democratically elected president, Manuel Zelaya, leftist expelled military June. Committee Chairman John Kerry criticized DeMint "intransigence" putting hold two Obama nominations State Department jobs Latin America, initially denied money DeMint's trip. But Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell somehow found funding Defense Department. "DeMint using issue cynically hold hostage entire U.S. policy Latin America order defend coup," says Adam Isacson, Latin American specialist Washington's Center International Policy. "Little Honduras brought ghosts Cold War closet, paralyzed policy provoking [DeMint] holds," Julia Sweig, director Latin American Studies Council Foreign Relations, told me. Some Hill staffers even blunter: "These losers Bush administration drove Latin American policy frickin' cliff trying rescue legacy," one aide told The Daily Beast. A number Democrats foreign-policy experts contend mounting right-wing attack Latin American policy filled void left Obama administration slow cut aid take firmer stance president installed Honduran military, Roberto Micheletti. Driven partly desire appease opposition Congress distaste left-wing populists Obama administration "slow-walked" response coup summer, Sweig says. More recently, though, administration toughened approach cutting vital aid worth least $35 million blocking Honduran officials' visas. The goal: pressure Micheletti regime enter serious negotiations Organization American States restore democratic government Zelaya. Informed observers say indications Micheletti's flexibility alarmed right-wingers Washington helped trigger DeMint's visit buck regime's resistance. An informal network right-leaning American advocacy groups ideologues entangled anti-Zelaya legal PR battles Honduras coup. Among them: Otto Reich, Cuban-American headed State Department's now-defunct Office Public Diplomacy Iran-Contra scandal, subsequently investigated special joint congressional panel—and U.S. Comptroller General, found engaged "prohibited covert activities" using public funds attack Reagan's critics. Reich, later appointed President George W. Bush assistant secretary Western Hemisphere Affairs private consultant, launched media campaign Zelaya coup alleging corruption. "Your Loony Left sources say I architect Iran-Contra like say I'm architect Zelaya coup," told phone Panama. He disputes claims illegal Iran-Contra activites "crap," asserting based fired House staffer's unpublished memo. But Greg Grandin, Latin American history professor NYU, darker view Reich's role: "It's kind origins Swift Boating," says. "It's related he's now." Conservative supporters current Honduran government argue arcane legal grounds worldwide condemnation coup. "It's first time all, countries world wrong," Reich told me. He criticized sees erroneous reporting Latin American controversies, taking The New York Times task article last Thursday says implied paid lobby behalf Micheletti regime. "I guess facts interfered [the] story," says. "Can believe sources say The New York Times malicious deserves slow death experiencing?" A DeMint spokesman says senator hasn't even met Reich talk Honduras, although Reich aide says they've spoken DeMint's staff. Adding mystery coup, left-wingers Latin America U.S. floated conservatives say unproven conspiracy theories Reich somehow played role destabilizing Zelaya's regime. He firmly denied The Daily Beast: "I cannot possibly answer Loony Left conspiracy charges me. But I try: I nothing removal Zelaya." But rumors may add aura power founder Otto Reich Associates. He's drawn attention new Honduras allegations penning column Miami Herald boldly headlined, "I Did Not Orchestrate Coup Honduras." Perhaps primary influence DeMint's thinking right-wing Honduran-American lawyer Miguel Estrada, whose 2001 nomination U.S. Court Appeals D.C. Circuit rejected Senate. In addition Reich, former Bush administration officials played key roles influencing DeMint spreading arguments Honduran regime include Roger Noriega, former aide late Sen. Jesse Helms (the far-right chairman Foreign Relations Committee) also served assistant secretary Western Hemisphere Affairs 2003 2005. On July 2, Noriega appeared The NewsHour Jim Lehrer argue legitimacy new Honduran regime. He identified former ambassador Organization American States visiting fellow American Enterprise Institute— paid agent pro-regime forces. Noriega officially registered firm, Visions America, representing Honduran business group mid- July. Yet, Times reported, worked Association Honduran Manufacturers set meetings supporters regime eight U.S. senators—including DeMint—in early July. That visit Washington Honduran business political figures July 2 July 10, Foreign Policy reported, occurred time House committee hearing Reich—along former Honduran supreme court justice Lanny Davis, former Clinton administration official lobbyist—testified favor current regime. Noriega's office declined return phone calls work. The lobbyist-organized visit also coincided Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings Obama's picks top Latin American posts: Thomas Shannon, current assistant secretary Western Hemisphere Affairs, nominated Ambasssador Brazil; Arturo Valenzuela, director Georgetown University's Center Latin American Studies senior director Inter-American Affairs National Security Council President Clinton's second term, tapped assistant secretary Western Hemisphere Affairs. Both Valenzuela Shannon approved Senate Foreign Relations Committee late July. Julia Sweig Council Foreign Relations observes, "They're polarizing figures." But they're hostages DeMint's war. At July 8 nomination hearings, Valenzuela angered DeMint defending administration's decision condemn overthrow coup: "In studies military coups Latin America, classic military coup," Valenzuela said. DeMint's critics contend continually refused compromise offers State Department officials fellow senators lift holds, including promise extensive floor debate Honduras floor vote nominees. DeMint's spokesperson, Wesley Denton, says he's acting good faith genuine concern important crisis. "If nominees top priority Democrats, hasn't Senator Reid brought floor?" asks. "There nothing Senator DeMint stop full debate roll-call vote them." Technically that's true, would rare violation Senate tradition so. DeMint taken issue Honduras, Denton claims, because, "the State Department's actions directly relevant two nominees seeking committee's approval." Yet DeMint took crusade Honduras—in critics say yet another vehicle "break" Obama—one congressional observer jokes, "He couldn't find Honduras map."
