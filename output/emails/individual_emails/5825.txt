Great hear. I'm also working final round edits Jack, Eric, Raj, others -- also trimming improving flow speech bit. You'll get revised draft tonight. If think improved, we'll use it, use draft made changes to, you'd prefer. Lissa office tomorrow handle edits. You teleprompter. No reason I know include Zuma; I add reference. Thank you!
