The answer, course, no, riot geography. Two veteran intelligence operatives much Middle Eastern Afghan experience, speaking attribution, agreed stable, secure Afghanistan doesn't change equation, least significantly. The popular perception al-Qaida Afghanistan propaganda news clip, shown gazillion times last eight years, replete terrorist "trainees" shalwar-kameez (knee-length shirts baggy pantaloons) running obstacle courses emerging tunnels, presumably kill us beds. Al-Qaida doesn't need commando-steeled volunteers attack United States allies. For next Sept. 11, chances already selected highly motivated, brainwashed wackjobs among graduates Pakistan's madrassas, look forward one button push land plenty sky 72 impatient maidens await arrival. Al-Qaida's "martyrs" don't need Afghan training camps WMD terrorism. In fact, inconspicuous, physique avoid-at-all-cost likely arouse suspicion. Al-Qaida need Afghanistan next terrorist objective. In fact, follow events Afghanistan closely taken aback Obama said Afghanistan war necessity that's al-Qaida. is. They haven't since Afghanistan liberated October 2001. They moved Pakistan's tribal areas attracted volunteers Middle East Europe. When reconstituted Taliban insurgent force re-entered Afghanistan large numbers 2004, al-Qaida interested insecure old training camps. Even Pakistan's current offensive.against Taliban al-Qaida tribal areas successful, al-Qaida entity captured destroyed. Its clandestine operatives widely scattered Middle East, Africa, Europe, North South America. As alternatives Afghanistan Pakistan, Yemen, vernacular intelligence community, do/is it. Somalia do/is it. West African states whose writ doesn't extend much beyond capitals do/are it. Grimy North African suburbs major French cities do/are it. British provincial towns Pakistani enclaves do/are it. And Internet's thousands pro-al-Qaida Web sites do/are it. Osama bin Laden deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri believed comfortably installed tribal chiefs compound somewhere near Quetta, capital Pakistan's constantly rebellious Baluchistan province, 48 percent country's land with. 10 million 175 million people. There al-Qaida central issuing orders thousands adherents world over. If the:re connection Afghanistan core problem "no Sept. lls," United States 41 friendly nations there? Even event Taliban victory years come, Taliban would stupid enough invite al-Qaida back. Three months prior Sept. 11, 2001, palpable tension Taliban leader Mullah Omar bin Laden. Omar complained bin Laden issuing "too many fatwas (religious edicts) business didn't complete religious education." Omar also prevented journalists seeing bin Laden. The Taliban leader knows lost power country bin Laden terrorists United States. In today's Afghanistan almost everything turns corruption mismanagement. The average citizen seen little benefit expenditures $250 billion range -- top $1 trillion Iraq. The .U.S. effort plagued fraud, laced mismanagement bereft strategic focus. One example among many others came 2007 United States awarded massive contract worth $300 million A:EY, Florida-based company, supply Afghan army 52 types ammo, chiefly bullets AK-47s. All requirements safety inspections, mandatory ammo delivered U.S. forces, removed. Thus AEY able shop around Eastern Europe cheapest ammo available. Millions rounds old Chinese ammo made 1960s turned substandard. dangerous. The State Department aware going object speed criterion. AEY officers eventually indicted Florida. But U.S. officials involved got slap wrist. Wherever U.S. inspectors look, find fraud abuse. There even cases -- reported GlobalPost reporter Jean Mackenzie -- American contractors paying bribes Taliban ensure aid projects disrupted. This recipe war without end. She also reports disguised Taliban office Kabul reviews aid projects determines amount paid Taliban. If true, United States paying Afghan government fight Taliban also paying Taliban fight Afghan government. The key lies Pakistan. Almost terrorist trails Europe lead back Pakistan -- madrassas. These free Koranic schools stepped vacuum education system poor military takes 50 percent government revenue. A fraction United States spent Iraq Afghanistan would go long way turning Pakistan around. Instead, Congress, infinite wisdom, authorizing $1.2 trillion wars allocated $7.5 billion Pakistan five years -- umpteen caveats. In country 175 million, drop proverbial bucket.
