Levin opposed surge, voted funding troops. Pasted Levin's speech troops Afghanistan. We'll copy well. Afghan speech FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE September 11, 2009 Contact: Senator Levin's Office Phone: 202.224.6221 Senate Floor Speech - Surge Afghan Army Remarks prepared delivery Today mark solemn anniversary. Eight years ago morning, nation attacked terrorist extremists motivated hatred bent destruction. It always appropriate remember shock day, innocent lives lost, efforts nation made since day ensure Afghanistan, nation hosted terrorists, cannot become safe haven terrorists seeking attack us. But today especially appropriate occasion take stock efforts, consider best continue them. I recently returned trip Afghanistan, I joined colleagues Senators Jack Reed Ted Kaufman. The situation Afghanistan serious. Security deteriorated. But take right steps, ensure Afghanistan revert Taliban-friendly government could provide safe haven al Qaeda terrorize us world. The Obama administration's new strategy, focusing securing Afghan population's safety partnering Afghan security forces effort, important start reversing situation Afghanistan. The change strategy led forces, words General McChrystal's Counterinsurgency Guidance, "live, eat train together [with Afghan security forces], plan operate together, depend one another, hold accountable....and treat equal partners success." The Guidance goes say success Afghan security forces "is goal." To achieve goal increase accelerate efforts support Afghan security forces efforts become self-sufficient delivering security nation â€” consider whether increase U.S. combat forces levels already planned next months. These steps include increasing size Afghan Army police much faster presently planned; providing trainers Afghan Army police presently planned; providing equipment presently planned; working separate local Taliban fighters leaders attract side government Iraq. While security situation Afghanistan worsened, still important advantages there. The Afghan people hate Taliban. Public opinion polls show support Taliban 5%. In addition, Afghan army highly motivated troops proven fighters. Despite advantages, face significant challenges. General McChrystal believes, I agree, need regain initiative create momentum towards success. General McChrystal worries, rightly so, perception lost initiative, impact perception Afghan people, government, al Qaeda Taliban. By contrast, dispel perception, chance convince local lower- level Taliban fighters lay arms rejoin Afghan society. I believe effective way retake initiative Afghanistan series steps ensure Afghanistan's army police manpower, equipment support secure nation. First, increase troop levels Afghan army police faster currently planned. There approximately 90,000 troops Afghan army now, number scheduled go 134,000 October 2010. The Afghan police scheduled reach level 82,000 time. For long time, many us urged establishment goal 240,000 Afghan troops 160,000 Afghan police 2013. The Afghan Minister Defense strongly supported numbers. It appears government Afghan government prepared accept goals. But need additional Afghan forces urgent. I believe possible essential advance goals year, 2012. Our military Afghanistan repeatedly pointed need Afghan forces. In one sector Helmand province visited last week, Marines outnumbered Afghan soldiers 5 one. A Marine Company commander Helmand province told New York Times July lack Afghan troops "is absolutely Achilles heel." What need increase size Afghan army police? According Afghan Defense Minister Wardak, lack Afghan manpower; we've assured available. But need significantly trainers. We asked General Formica, charge American effort train Afghan security forces, whether increase possible. He indicated would make assessment would necessary order meet earlier timetable. In meantime, also press NATO allies much greater forcefulness provide trainers. If NATO allies going come combat forces pledged, least could provide additional trainers. Larger Afghan security forces also require mid-level Afghan officers. In addition supporting efforts graduate Afghan officers army academies, consider recommendation Defense Minister Wardak previous mid-level officers fought war Soviets return service interim basis. Minister Wardak emphasized men well qualified well motivated, may trained current tactics, nonetheless could temporarily meet need enlarged army new group officers trained. A larger Afghan force need supporting infrastructure, barracks. While available infrastructure may modern, adequate exists sufficient amounts. Larger Afghan security forces require additional equipment. There must major effort transfer significant amount equipment coming Iraq Afghan army police. Such significant commitment equip Afghan security forces would also help demonstrate U.S. determination take initiative create momentum right direction. There enormous amount equipment coming Iraq; military calling one greatest transfers military goods world's history. A significant part could transferred Afghan forces, increasing capability without weakening readiness. And yet seem kind crash effort place that. We need obtain urgent basis list basic equipment needs Afghan forces list needs could met major program transfer equipment leaving Iraq. Rapidly expanding Afghanistan's military police forces would address one major problems risks face there. General McChrystal told us worries waiting 2013 larger Afghan force creates gap capabilities brings significant risk failure. But accelerating training equipping Afghan forces year, address concern. Depending additional capability Afghan, rather U.S., forces, also addresses major problem public perception Afghanistan. The larger military footprint there, enemies seek drive wedge us Afghan population, spreading falsehood seek dominate Muslim nation. Finally, make concerted effort separate local Taliban leaders. In Iraq, large numbers young Iraqis attacking us switched side became "Sons Iraq." They drawn part promise jobs amnesty past attacks, part recognition status quo creating horrific violence communities. In interests interests nation, switched sides became positive force. That prospect exists Afghanistan. Afghan leaders military say local Taliban fighters motivated largely need job loyalty local leader pays ideology religious zeal. They believe effort attract fighters government's side could succeed, offered security families, penalty previous activity us. General McChrystal emphasized potential re-integration accomplish result achieved Iraq. Here General McChrystal said July 28th: "Most fighters see Afghanistan Afghans, foreign cadre them. But don't see deeply ideological even politically motivated; operating pay; commander's charismatic leadership; frustrated local leaders. So I believe significant potential go I would call mid- low-level Taliban fighters leaders offer re-integration Afghanistan constitution." But "game changing" possibility apparently factored General McChrystal's assessment. There plan yet put place Sons Iraq approach Afghanistan. It urgent lay steps need taken involve local national Afghan leaders effort. They alone accomplish crucial job, first Afghan allies must draft plan urgent basis. And potential positive impact plan taken account consider need additional U.S. military resources. Afghanistan's people grateful aid, also eager assume responsibility future. In tiny village Helmand Province, invited meet village elders council meeting, shura. One hundred men sat floor chatted us future country's future. When asked long United States stay, one elder said: "Until moment make security forces self-sufficient. Then welcome visit us, soldiers guests." Helping Afghanistan achieve self-sufficiency security everybody's goal. On little difference opinion, Afghanistan's village councils corridors Capitol. Can help Afghanistan reach self-sufficiency security fast enough? Can get way regains initiative creates momentum need? Can encourage lower level Taliban abandon insurgency headed terrorists whose fanaticism don't share? I believe can, supporting far rapid growth Afghan Army police; providing trainers quickly; rapid infusion Afghan units equipment longer needed Iraq; rapidly adopting plan re-integration lower level Taliban fighters Afghan society. In words, need surge Afghan security forces. Our support surge show commitment success mission clearly national security interest, without creating bigger U.S. military footprint provides propaganda fodder Taliban. I believe taking steps urgent basis, completing previously planned announced increase U.S. combat forces, provides best chance success mission: preventing Afghanistan run Taliban government harbors supports Al-Qaeda, whose goal inflict additional catastrophic attacks United States world. And implement steps considering increase U.S. ground combat forces beyond already planned end year.
