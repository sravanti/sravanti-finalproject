The motorcade, twisting skidding rain-splashed streets hour; public meetings camera lights journey's end; spotlight let two decades. It almost 2008 US presidential election - hailed exciting generation - never ended. But campaign without vote. Today, Clinton's convoy snaking Sao Paulo, Brazil, South Hampton, New Hampshire. She longer aspirant White House, despite overnight flights, town hall meetings strategy sessions make gruelling schedule might suggest. Instead, Latin America shore relations region promote new idea US leadership, one much built around herself. She's bigger ecstatic audiences 700-odd students staff crammed hall tonight Zumbi dos Pradares, Afro-Brazilian university, she's still greeted wave raised arms audience snaps away mobile phones. In convoy moments before, wrapped shawl, suffering cold angry delays pushed us side streets speckled box-like bars, warehouses love hotels Brazilian motorists sought cut path. There sign now. With metabolism born politician, feeds energy audience takes questions students, teachers local celebrities hour. Hillary Clinton never looks happier centre stage. Most US secretaries state wouldn't bother sort event, much less initiate arrange screened biggest local channel. Yet Clinton almost every foreign trip - seems spend half life official 727, crammed long-time aides armed bodyguards. The schedule backbreaking constantly shifting. She notched quarter million miles since taking office. On Latin America trip, thrown confusion earthquake Chile, already visited four countries 24 hours. We go tiny Uruguay, stay brief check hotel shower; Argentina, spend almost time presidential palace; Chile itself, don't leave airport; Brazil, spend almost full day. So exactly Clinton trying never-ending world tour? Travelling week, talking people inside outside administration, I tried find out. "We case make case made president prime minister foreign minister ambassador," tells weeks later, perches sofa expansive office, view Lincoln Memorial. "People voice opinion vote many instances direction societies take ... I want model different kind leadership open willing listen [also] stand ground necessary." She argues trips help restore US's image wake Bush administration - making contact public opinion abroad, boosting American power. Her aides say that, battle-hardened politician also happens one famous women world, ideally placed carry task. But deeper question whether merely implementing foreign policy crafted Barack Obama, boss former rival, whether role - ambitions - go beyond that. Is kind saleswoman-in-chief US, I ask? "Well, I think part job," replies, toying napkin underneath glass water. "If making case American values American leadership, make people get information ... Given bridges build repair work do, travel." As S'ao Paulo, system strain - "I've fighting day," says masks cough set allergies (Washington's cherry blossom trees shedding flowers). Life still hectic - volcanic ash cloud paralysed Europe televisions throughout State Department showing first British election debate. But Clinton remains enthusiastic, affable unhurried, speech peppered exclamations "oh gosh", even discusses issues state. She politely asks I updates Europe's airspace shutdown tells she's talking Norway's foreign minister it. "He said dust gets engines size, even Air Force One - it's chunky! I don't know else describe it," says, odd note hilarity entering voice pronounces word "chunky". Clinton often speaks eager, unvarnished way - world away clipped, on-message manner immediate predecessor post, Condoleezza Rice. If anything, undiplomat - known less calibrated circumlocutions plain speaking sometimes gaffes, woman retains formidable political constituency laugh admitted send cats scurrying room. Her staff point third elected politician 60 years served secretary state, first come outside foreign policy establishment since James Baker, George H.W. Bush's right-hand man perhaps illustrious recent predecessor. She may substantive politician office since William Jennings Bryan, three-time presidential candidate served secretary almost century ago. "Her stature world stage, almost presidential stature, set apart," Bill Burns, top career diplomat State Department, tells me. "Leaders want meet her. And town hall meetings make difference public opinion." State visitor Hillary Clinton greeted Air Force Base Commander Colonel Celso de Araujo S'ao Paulo airport March Back Sao Paulo, meeting university ranges far confines dramatis personae traditional diplomacy. Annie, young woman red blue dreadlocked hair, tells Clinton dance percussion classes asks study US without paying college fees. A nervous young man confesses lost halfway abstruse question tariff policy; Clinton, smiling nodding vaguely automatic way hers, bears same. Another female student asks autograph. When answering, Clinton sometimes opens eyes wide emphasises phrase; moments, seemingly random, pulls hands apart demonstrating size fish. Then law student called Marina asks abortion - illegal Brazil - Clinton moves treacherous terrain. She speaks Brazilian hospital visited 1990s treated expectant mothers women suffering consequences backstreet abortions. "Wealthy women rights every country," says. "And poor women don't." Her strength feeling can't hidden denounces "the great toll illegal abortions take denial women able exercise fundamental personal right". Tom Shannon, US ambassador Brazil, tells later: "I understand possible concern might come close domestic issues. But wasn't laying prescription Brazil. She sharing experience woman American politics secretary state." It's true: Clinton doesn't quite cross line. Onstage, controlled without seeming artificial, convivial without appearing over-effusive, previous age would call real trouper. At podium looks straight ahead, lips carefully expressionless. Still, old competitive instincts haven't left her. Perhaps lecterns press conferences, reminiscent Democratic presidential debates, exiting podium joint appearance Argentina's president Cristina Fernandez, Clinton makes clear satisfaction last word. The expert debater usually bested Obama left stage. Yet competitive urge coexists one insider describes "almost inhuman loyalty" towards Obama. Her mastery facts - "information carnivore" one officials calls - comes despite consensus much Washington role consists largely implementing foreign policy Obama inner circle framed, rather helping frame herself. In Sao Paulo, shows loyalty striking fashion asked repeatedly positive discrimination - another sensitive topic Brazil - least because, Clinton observes, Afro- Brazilians account half country's population 2 per cent university students. "That suggests special steps need taken [in] recruiting admitting students chance succeed," tells hall, inching towards domestic politics, speaking pride progress US civil rights movement made past half-century. She says: "The election Barack Obama, many believe, greatest accomplishment demonstrated African-American could elected president United States." Among crowd, I catch breath scribble words. It's hard think fulsome statement woman fought hard Obama - squandered huge poll lead millions dollars struggle him. The great collaborator Clinton established strong working relationships within Obama administration When I ask Clinton later managed move antagonism primary race obedience office, dismisses question anodyne "that's politics". She adds: "We're working really hard well together ... It never comes more, seems like ancient history me." Not ancient, I think, willing admit failings campaign. "I always run inclusive successful organisations," retorts I ask whether she'd applied lessons searing experience new post. She admits didn't want job State - says exhausted election missed Senate -. "but end day, I'm pretty old-fashioned president asks something, you'd better really good reason can't." Also, adds: "Suppose I won I asking cabinet ... I would wanted say yes." Others say relationship complex, dint loyalty unflagging hard work, Clinton moved closer charmed circle made even formidable political force before. "Quite simply, gives good advice president year half recognised that," says Anne-Marie Slaughter, head State Department policy planning unit. "The relationship based performance job." By accounts, it's collaborative partnership, though perhaps warm one. Clinton boasts good working relationship main players administration - formed something alliance defence secretary Robert Gates, although life-and-death issues Afghanistan, Gates, her, taken lead. As one official told me, secretaries state often either popular department - Colin Powell comes mind - rest administration - Condoleezza Rice - Clinton managed both. In truth, Clinton's language remains harder-edged Obama's - recently claimed Iran's Revolutionary Guard staged slow-motion coup - sometimes willing hint using military. "She seems step bit spine right time," says Kurt Volker, US ambassador Nato George W. Bush. She also assumed ever prominent role talking leaders Benjamin Netanyahu Israel Hamid Karzai Afghanistan - apparently trusted Obama. Meanwhile, careful keep husband, former US president, background. Aides say barely seen building - though Clinton says behind scenes Bill Clinton gives strategic advice. "One favourite sayings, I remind time, kind baseball saying," says: "Don't major minors; keep eye headlines trend lines." It co-operative stance rather notable effort set grand vision chief theme time far State. When I ask Clinton name proudest achievement office, replies "the effective collaborative approach administration taken towards identifying solving problems." A process-oriented, less provocative answer would hard imagine. But maybe, I think, US less scope grand strategy past couple decades, country seemed bestride world colossus-style. Clinton suggests formidable tasks confronting US administration little scope enter internecine fights needs instead focus challenges hand. Whatever reason stance, seems smart decision - accounts she's overcome many suspicions White House retinue towards her. "It's fair say born administration's inner circle slowly surely, consequential decisions, prime seat table," says one official. Praising calls "Terminator-quality durability determination," adds: "She's done amazing amount work, judging way build strategic vision bottom up, mastering details." Indeed, Clinton's ability master arcane foreign policy briefs marvel building. She dropped obscure working groups shown unnerving knowledge details. At confirmation hearings last year exchanged facts arctic Alaskan senator; meeting So Paulo becomes enthused freight transport policy Brazil US. She acknowledges finding feet foreign policy something struggle, despite campaign claims expertise field. "It intellectually challenging, get arms around issues," says. During first year, criticised apparent gaffes - including way called Israel halt building settlements occupied territory hail partial freeze months later unprecedented. On election campaign, says, "you may different city four times day message you're trying deliver repetitive aimed audience. But might deal 10 different countries' problems, six different regional global challenges course day." As Latin America tour shows, trying - travel incessantly solve array international issues. She forefront US's efforts consolidate relations number important countries - predominantly Russia China, also rising powers Brazil, Turkey, Indonesia South Africa - cool anti-American feeling hotspots, notably Pakistan. She says push working, hailing "change public opinion places pretty negative US" - reference Russia Pakistan. But far smooth sailing. Differences Iran Israel's raid aid-bearing ships Gaza stoked tensions Turkey Brazil recently, amid questioning effectiveness Obama administration's policies. During time road, stop Brazil focal point - surprising given country's increased profile Latin America leader. Clinton heading administration's push secure sanctions Iran, Brasilia tries fails win President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva cause. She employs almost combative tone press conference Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign minister. At moments appears barely contain irritation, denounces "an Iran runs Brazil" well countries Turkey China "telling different things different people avoid international sanctions". Amorim spiky way - drawing parallels 1990s sanctions Iraq claims weapons mass destruction 2003 war. "Of course, I don't agree everything Secretary said," says. It happy experience - indeed past week Brazil Turkey voted sanctions United Nations - yet Hillary Clinton nowhere near giving up. Years ago, one Bill Clinton's biographers described approach government "permanent campaign", appears wife's preferred form existence well. If one constant Clinton's life, never throws cards, whether motivates power public service. "Never, never!" exclaims, I ask whether ever thought walking wings frustrations indignities time White House. "I realistic sense high- stakes politics requires took get it's shocking arena ... figure out, take seriously purposes analysis understanding, can't take personally." Such treatment seems rankle same. She's listening coverage ahead British debate plainly irritated coverage leaders' wives. "Whether woman's running office she's supporting husband who's running office gets criticised wearing open-toed shoes colour coat, there's lot history bear woman puts political arena," says. Another country Clinton boards official 727 fly Sao Paulo Costa Rica Injustice towards women appears issue enthuses Clinton job - many incarnations American public life, whether First Lady before. "I feel passionately American national security interests world's, women given opportunities tools make lives," says. In 1990s steered clear reading newspapers way treated. Today, says, "I certainly don't read coverage me, I read else going I need know job." "It's baloney," says Philippe Reines, press adviser, set meeting sitting one side office. "Yeah, yeah, right, that's tells me," Clinton responds. I wonder. She may read stories her, boosted domestic profile still talking American magazines Esquire, Vogue Parade. To end? Clinton said serve one four-year term secretary state - understandable, given grind job. When I ask whether expects woman president next decade so, responds: "I'd love that, obviously I would love that. I want front centre happens." "Any chance would you?" I ask. "No, no, I don't think that's cards," Clinton says. She's given categoric denials past. "I think there's whole generation young women young, mature, seasoned women earning stripes recognising tough there. It faint heart run president, I believe harder women, is, that's fact." But, says one US official, "all profiles media treatment undercut argument finished electoral politics. Why stuff? She's already Hillary Clinton. You ask: 'What's idea behind raising domestic profile still further?" Indeed now, counts, popular politician America Washington say could good fit vice-presidential slot 2012 elections. Back Sao Paulo, town hall meeting over, Clinton faces seven-hour flight Costa Rica. The journey goes on, saleswoman-in-chief US unruly world, faces long, hard road. Today US sometimes struggles assert world stage. But obstacles rather fewer product pitching herself. A secretary state like none her, Hillary Clinton, long one formidable figures US politics, looking stronger ever. Daniel Dombey FT's US diplomatic correspondent David Miliband: "Hillary rock star ... great sense fun, great sense humour" It's early start chalking scorecard Hillary Clinton, Obama administration, laying foundations long-term change America's foreign policy. The challenges immense - probably difficult inheritance previous administration. But American leadership essential commitment multilateralism - fact multi, multilateralism using different overlapping forums - real right. You also remember Hillary rock star. When I arrived Nato Foreign Ministers meeting March 2009, nice surprise staff, never mind press, seemed turned droves arrival. Then I realised Hillary 10 minutes behind me. That said, thing surprised working Clinton intelligence hard work, well known, behind serious exterior someone great sense fun, great sense humour. She seen politics sides, laugh well others. She's remarkably good listener, always synthesising ideas opinions develop own. She thinks strategically well tactically. She's also very, unpompous. Hillary political person particular way, honours politics public service believes democratic politics necessary evil, calling value vocation. She knows win lose some, it's essential take part. There's one thing. Hillary people person thinks deeply psychology people she's dealing with. Their motivation, loyalties, culture. It's real emotional intelligence trying understand people disagree get agree. I think must many members administration say good colleague. David Miliband shadow foreign secretary Gideon Rachman: "Relations White House State Department particularly close" A school teacher asked write report Hillary Clinton's stint secretary state would give 10/10 effort rather modest mark actual achievements - maybe six seven. Secretaries state generally judged two criteria. First, done endless bureaucratic turf wars characterise Washington politics? Second, effective promoting US foreign policy wider world? Success one area usually helps other. Henry Kissinger superb Washington infighter - close relationship President Nixon made effective overseas. Colin Powell, George W. Bush's first secretary state, widely admired outside US - came wrong side many Washington battles, limited ability get things done wider world. Hillary Clinton skilfully avoided sucked debilitating Washington struggles damaged Powell. Despite often poisonous rivalry Obama Clinton camps campaign, Clinton good working relationship president. But relations White House State Department cordial, seem particularly close. Clinton appointed many loyalists campaign State Department, result State rather detached Obama's inner circle. Obama's penchant making high-profile speeches foreign capitals Cairo, Prague, Tokyo Istanbul means president done anyone else define administration's approach world. That still leaves role Clinton fill crucial details policy. But special representatives appointed deal Afghanistan Middle East - Treasury critical China policy. Asked Clinton's impact secretary state, one senior European policymaker purses lips says: "She's done great trips, she's highly professional. But it's hard see particular area really driven policy." Gideon Rachman FT's chief foreign affairs columnist David Rothkopf: "When asked deliver tough messages, done unflinchingly" Hillary Clinton cautious secretary state: protected president well pursued agenda without upstaging - early concern, given stature. She worked well members cabinet, reconsidering role structure State Department. That includes review role diplomacy going forward. Clinton acknowledged rise new powers changing global power structure taken steps reshape US foreign policy structure accordingly. An important part recognising importance co-operating private non-state actors NG0s, well dealing non-state threats. When administration called upon deliver tough messages, done unflinchingly. This allowed president articulate strategic vision Clinton goes implementing. Still, neither secretary state president determines global situation. The US may powerful country world one among many powerful countries, many aspects situation face today beyond control. The Obama administration dealt extremely difficult hand: Iraq Afghanistan, Iran North Korea's nuclear programmes, rise emerging powers complex still unfolding series financial crises. We gone world US thought limitless resources unbounded options one limits clear; world could work GB one work context G20; world new technologies new powers play bigger role. All things would dictate change foreign policy regardless office. Hillary Clinton established solid foundation. The next step identify couple signature issues - couple signature successes. That take next level. David Rothkopf visiting scholar Carnegie Endowment International Peace expertise national security
