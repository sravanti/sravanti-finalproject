In bilats today, I learned G77 countries wondering what's them. They're developing countries they're UK US. Brazil may second guessing creation new agency yet agency benefit women everywhere. I don't know you'll opportunity say Brazil's leader hope UN women's agency continue support. In fact Tom Shannon told they're really interested women's issues wanted sign MOU us. Sometimes there's disconnect NY perm reps capitals 2nd, I don't know you're still going Chile. If talk Bachelet future, tell many govt reps UN would like see head new women's agency. It's clear she's even interested. Thx
