Dear Secretary Clinton, I hope elbow healing quickly. I mentioned work maritime developments region Persian Gulf East China Sea Sea Japan. Below key findings report, main takeaway political impact Chinese military modernization may greater narrow technical analysis China's capabilities would suggest, range reasons, technical political, prospects regional cooperation limited, pathways conflict numerous increasing. All best, Jackie Key findings workshop include: • Chinese naval modernization proceeded rates higher forecast 10 years ago created capability complicate operation US carrier battle groups within 1,000 kilometers Chinese coastline. • The Indian Ocean may coming decades operating area SSBNs countries limited experience sustained SSBN patrols, including India, China, possibly Pakistan. • Chinese maritime relations countries along littoral area continued develop, new friendly relationship emerging Sri Lanka, complement existing relations Myanmar Pakistan. This may lead new form "blue-brown water" naval operations, Chinese naval forces operate far Chinese bases, close coasts client states. The workshop tended conclusion trends region make maritime cooperation easy. These trends include: Japanese concern Chinese dominance waters within 1,000 miles Chinese territory immediate consequences Japan's maritime autonomy. • Indian suspicion Chinese naval developments Hainan Island, Chinese development port infrastructure Pakistan Myanmar, possibility Chinese ballistic missile submarines operating close India. • Indian interest SSBNs, plus Chinese SSBN ports Hainan even, possibly, Pakistani SSBNs, creates possibility multiple SSBN patrols Indian Ocean, along potential naval nuclear accidents sea. • Asymmetries levels operational competence, technology, submarines maritime aviation, which, example, make functional multi-national naval cooperation harder states afraid revealing technologies weaknesses. • The major role land-based maritime warfare strike complexes region, means war sea always carries risk escalation strikes ground targets homeland areas. The report also offers two scenarios United States may consider engaging militarily region. The first scenario, concerns clash Japan China waters claimed both, compels us consider: • The circumstances Chinese may seek demonstrate new maritime capabilities must taken seriously respected, • What United States would lose support Japanese, faced world Japan became either subordinate power China nuclear armed state, capable pursuing national interest independent United States. The second scenario concerns American naval blockade Iran tested nuclear weapon, potentially giving rise interaction United States China far operating bases close territory client China, "blue-brown water" clash. In scenario, China using navy show presence, force United States ask whether wants go war China political conflict less black white. Thinking options would left United States circumstances underscores Chinese naval forces may political impact 2025 narrow assessment military capabilities would suggest.
