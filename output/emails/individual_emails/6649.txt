Did Sean. Sid The Political Scene Confounding Fathers The Tea Party's Cold War roots. Sean Wilentz October 18, 2010 ann Beck's view American history stems paranoid politics fifties. A months ago, cable-television radio host Glenn Beck began Fox News show one favorite props: pipe clenched teeth. "I've got pipe," told audience, speech slightly muddled stem, "because we're going speak schoolish kind things." The theme day "Restoring History," Beck, looking professorial neat dark blazer pink button-down shirt, began lesson peering stack history textbooks pronouncing full falsehoods, produced "malicious progressive intent." Progressives, explained—liberals, socialists, Communists, entire spectrum left—"knew separate us history able separate us Constitution God." For next hour, Beck earnestly explained history "is stolen us": depression 1920, example, conservative economics saved nation "near-depression" 1946—crises progressives don't want know about. "You've taught one lie, I think, whole life," said. For fractious Tea Party movement, Beck—a former drive-time radio jockey, recovering alcoholic, Mormon convert—has emerged unifying figure intellectual guide. One opinion poll, released July Democracy Corps, showed "the highly regarded individual among Tea Party supporters," seen merely entertainer, like Rush Limbaugh, "educator." And past months Beck established institute learning: online, for-profit Beck University. Enrollees take courses like Faith 102, contends "revisionists secular progressives" separation church state; Hope 102, attack activist federal government; combined Charity 101/102/103, highly restrictive interpretation rights, federalism, division powers. During "Restoring History" episode, Beck twice encouraged viewers join Web seminars, hear "lessons best brightest historians scholars could find." The B.U. faculty consists three members, including one bona-fide academic, James R. Stoner, Jr., chair political-science department Louisiana State University; two head management consulting firm founder WallBuilders, Web site calls "a national pro-family organization." Beck often acts professor, slightly jocular one, Fox News program. Surrounded charts figures, offers explanations current politics history lessons country's long march Obama-era totalitarianism. The decline, says, began Progressive era early twentieth century, particular Presidency Woodrow Wilson, Federal Reserve System graduated federal income tax came existence. "Wilson," Beck told radio audience August, "just despised America was." Beck's claims found audience among Tea Party spokesmen sympathizers. At movement's Freedom Summit Washington last September, one activist told reporter, "The election Teddy Roosevelt Woodrow Wilson 1912 started going downhill." And April angry member Tea Party Patriots group Cape Fear, North Carolina, claimed group's Web site "the things see happening country today started Wilson Administration." At Tax Day rally past spring, veteran conservative organizer Richard Viguerie described Tea Party "an unfettered new force middle class." And, indeed, calling Obama socialist tradition Woodrow Wilson audacious enough seem like marker new movement—or, least, new twist nation's long history conspiracy-mongering. In fact, marks revival ideas circulated extremist right half century ago, especially John Birch Society among admirers. Beck's version American history relies lessons acknowledged inspiration, late right-wing writer W. Cleon Skousen, also restates charges made Birch Society's founder, Robert Welch. The political universe is, course, different today Cold War. Yet Birchers' politics view American history—which focussed totalitarian threats home posed Soviet Union Communist China—has proved remarkably persistent. The pressing historical question extremist ideas held bay decades inside Republican Party exploded anew—and why, time, Party leaders done virtually nothing challenge ideas, great deal abet them. The early nineteen-sixties turbulent time American politics, right wing particular. In South, racist violence civil-rights workers constant, deepening sectional splits Democratic Party would time deliver solidly Democratic South Republicans. Southern elected officials, support called "massive resistance" civil-rights laws judicial rulings, resurrected ideas nullification interposition, claimed individual states could void federal laws within borders. Others focussed considered fearsome Communist menace inside United States. General Edwin A. Walker caused enormous stir resigned Army 1961, President John F. Kennedy's Pentagon reprimanded spreading right-wing propaganda among troops accusing prominent American officials Communist sympathies. Senator Strom Thurmond, Dixiecrat South Carolina, spoke many far right declared various modestly liberal domestic programs "fall clearly within category socialism." The John Birch Society one decade's controversial right-wing organizations. Founded 1958 Robert Welch, candy manufacturer Massachusetts, society took name Baptist missionary military- intelligence officer killed Communist Chinese forces 1945, Welch called first American casualty Cold War. The group founded propitious time. After Senator Joseph McCarthy's fall, 1954, many McCarthy's followers felt bereft voice, Welch seemed speak them; mid-sixties, society's membership estimated high hundred thousand. Welch, exploiting fears McCarthy called "immense" domestic conspiracy, declared federal government already fallen Communists' clutches. In tract titled "The Politician," attacked President Dwight D. Eisenhower "a dedicated, conscious agent Communist conspiracy" serving plot "all adult life." Late 1961, disastrous Bay Pigs invasion, accused Kennedy Administration "helping Communists everywhere world pretending opposite." Wherever looked, Welch saw Communist forces manipulating American economic foreign policy behalf totalitarianism. But within United States, believed, subversion actually begun years Bolshevik Revolution. Conflating modern liberalism totalitarianism, Welch described government "always inevitably enemy individual freedom." Consequently, charged, Progressive era, expanded federal government's role curbing social economic ills, dire period history, Woodrow Wilson "more one man started nation present road totalitarianism." In nineteen-sixties, Welch became convinced even Communist movement "a tool total conspiracy." This master conspiracy, said, forerunners ancient Sparta, sprang fully life eighteenth century, "uniformly Satanic creed program" Bavarian Illuminati. Run called "the Insiders," conspiracy resided chiefly international families financiers, Rothschilds Rockefellers, government agencies like Federal Reserve System Internal Revenue Service, nongovernmental organizations like Bilderberg Group, Council Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission. Since early twentieth century, done good deal evil work guise humanitarian uplift. "One broad avenue conspiratorial forces advance known progressive legislation," Welch declared 1966. "The collectivist theories demagogic pretenses destroyed earlier civilizations paraded forth disguise new modern concepts." In worst case, Welch believed, military action might necessary dislodge totalitarians. But moment nonviolent political revolution would suffice. Accordingly, designed Birch Society roughly, explicitly, Marxist-Leninist model vanguard revolutionary party: series small cells would work secret agitate populace elect right-thinking candidates office. "It isn't numbers worry about," Welch wrote, "but courage part followers stick necks play rough—the Communists do." The "Founder" would dictate society's policies, advised council two dozen businessmen professionals, local cells would overseen unyielding commanders. "It leadership demanding, exacting followers," Welch observed, "that achieves really dedicated support." Welch's group became synonymous right-wing extremism, earning satirical blasts critics ranging cartoonist Walt Kelly musicians Bob Dylan Dizzy Gillespie. The trumpeter, whose actual name John Birks Gillespie, made humorous run Presidency 1964, organizing John Birks Societies twenty-five states. Still, outlandish era's right-wing anti-Communists Welch Willard Cleon Skousen. A transplanted Canadian served Mormon missionary teens, Skousen considered radical early nineteen-sixties even J. Edgar Hoover's F.B.I. watched closely; one 1962 memo extensive F.B.I. file noted "during past year so, Skousen affiliated extreme right-wing 'professional communists' promoting anticommunism obvious financial purposes." Skousen employed F.B.I., 1935 1951, much time special agent working chiefly administration. These desk jobs, claimed implausibly, gave access confidential domestic intelligence Communism. Skousen also maintained served Hoover's administrative assistant; Hoover informed inquirers position. Skousen taught years speech religion departments Brigham Young University, interrupted stint, 1956 1960, police chief Salt Lake City. His time office contentious, raided friendly card game attended city's right-wing mayor, J. Bracken Lee, promptly fired. Lee called Skousen "a master half truths" said ran police department "like Gestapo"; Skousen's supporters placed burning crosses Mayor's lawn. After losing police job, Skousen founded group called All-American Society, Time described 1961 exemplar far-right "ultras." Although join Birch Society, Skousen worked American Opinion Speakers' Bureau, and, 1963, wrote rousing tract titled "The Communist Attack John Birch Society," condemned society's critics "promoting official Communist Party line." (This tic Skousen's; later defended Mormon policy denying priesthood blacks pamphlet called "The Communist Attack Mormons.") All along, Skousen's evolving thoughts ran tandem Welch's. In "The Naked Communist," lengthy primer published 1958, enlivened survey worldwide leftist threat outlandish claims, writing F.D.R.'s adviser Harry Hopkins treasonously delivered Soviets large supply uranium, Russians built first Sputnik plans stolen United States. A year Richard Condon's novel "The Manchurian Candidate" appeared, Skousen announced Communists creating "a regimented breed Pavlovian men whose minds could triggered immediate action signals masters." A later book, "The Naked Capitalist," decried Ivy League Establishment, who, Federal Reserve, Council Foreign Relations, Rockefeller Foundation, formed "the world's secret power structure." The conspiracy begun, Skousen wrote, reformers like wealthy banker Edward M. (Colonel) House, close adviser President Woodrow Wilson, helped put place Federal Reserve graduated income tax. In 1971, Skousen organized another group, Freemen Institute, later renamed National Center Constitutional Studies. According article published Review Religious Research, center's targets included "the Occupational Safety Health Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Communication Commission's fairness doctrine editorial broadcasting, federal government's change gold standard currency, subsidies farmers, federal aid education, federal social welfare, foreign aid, social security, elimination public school prayer Bible reading, (that familiar right-wing nemesis) United Nations." Skousen's pronouncements made pariah among conservative activists, including right-wing fringe. In 1962, ultraconservative American Security Council threw out, members felt "gone deep end." In 1971, review Mormon journal Dialogue accused Skousen "inventing fantastic ideas making inferences go far beyond bounds honest commentary," advancing doctrines came "perilously close" Nazism. And 1979, Skousen called President.Jimmy Carter puppet Council Foreign Relations Rockefeller family, president Mormon church issued national order banning announcements organizations. Skousen undeterred. In 1981, produced "The 5,000 Year Leap," treatise assembles selective quotations groundless assertions claim U.S. Constitution rooted Enlightenment Bible, framers believed minimal central government. Either proposition would astounded James Madison, often described guiding spirit behind Constitution, rejected state-established religions and, like Alexander Hamilton, proposed central government strong could veto state laws. "The 5,000 Year Leap" fervid book. Instead, calmly, ingratiatingly misleading. Skousen quotes various eighteenth-century patriots evils Samuel Adams, 1768, called "the Utopian schemes leveling," Skousen equates redistribution wealth. But mention Founders' endorsement taxing rich support general welfare. Thomas Jefferson, example, wrote approvingly 1811 federal taxes (then limited tariffs) fall solely wealthy, meant "the farmer see government supported, children educated, face country made paradise contributions rich alone, without called spend cent earnings." Skousen also challenges separation church state, asserting "the Founders indulging idle gesture adopted motto 'In God We Trust.' "In reality, motto came Constitutional Convention "E Pluribus Unum": many, one. "In God We Trust" came much later; use coins first permitted 1864, 1955, height Cold War, Congress mandate appear currency. The following year, President Eisenhower—who Welch charged Communist agent—approved "In God We Trust" national motto. In 1982, Skousen published follow-up work, ancestor-worshipping history text titled The Making America," prepared study guide nationwide seminars based contents. As Alexander Zaitchik reports informative study Beck, "Common Nonsense," new book became object controversy 1987, California Bicentennial Commission sold part fund-raising drive. Among offenses account slavery drawn long-disgraced work historian Fred A. Shannon, characterized slave children "pickaninnies" suggested worst victims slavery slaveholders themselves. The constitutional scholar Jack Rakove, Stanford, inspected Skousen's book seminars pronounced "a joke self-respecting scholar would think worth warm pitcher spit." By time Skousen died, 2006, little remembered outside ranks furthest-right Mormons. Then, 2009, Glenn Beck began touting work: "The Naked Communist," "The Naked Capitalist," and, especially, "The 5,000 Year Leap," called "essential understanding Founders built Republic way did." After Beck put book first spot required-reading list—and wrote enthusiastic new introduction reissue— shot top Amazon best-seller list. In first half 2009, sold two hundred fifty thousand copies. Local branches Tea Party Patriots, United American Tea Party, groups across country since organized study groups around it. "It time learn follow FREEDOM principles Founding Fathers," United American Tea Party video declares, referring principles expounded Skousen's book. If Beck movement's teacher, "The 5,000 Year Leap" become primer, "The Making America" kind 102- level text. The popularity Beck's broadcasts, reach two million viewers day, brought neo-Birchite ideas audience beyond Welch Skousen might dreamed of. Several times week, Beck informs audience socialists (whom also sometimes calls Fascists Communists) led Obama seized power, patriotic Americans must take country back. His TV show time featured "Comrade Updates," Beck described perfidy Soviet anthem played background. He attacks familiar bogeymen: Federal Reserve System (which asserts private conglomerate, unaccountable public); Council Foreign Relations (born "progressive idea" manipulate media order "let masses know done"); historical procession evildoers, including Skousen's old target Colonel House Welch's old target Woodrow Wilson. His sources matters, quite apart Skousen's books, unreliable. On September 22nd, amid diatribe House, Beck cited passage "Secrets Federal Reserve," Eustace Mullins. The book, commissioned 1948 Ezra Pound, startlingly anti-Semitic fantasy Jewish-led conspiracy all-powerful bankers established Federal Reserve service plot dominate world. Part Beck's allure promise reveal secret information. In one segment last year, produced drawing fasces—which described, anachronistically, "the Roman symbol Fascism"—and picture old Mercury dime, fasces reverse side. "Who brought dime in? It happened 1916—Woodrow Wilson President," said. "We've road Fascism while." Benito Mussolini, course, didn't adopt ancient symbol authority Fascist emblem nineteen-twenties; designer coin, sculptor Adolph A. Weinman, intended signify nation's military preparedness, paired olive branch illustrate desire peace. Beck's readings Progressive-era politics nearly bizarre. Whatever said Theodore Roosevelt, crypto-radical. It Roosevelt coined term "lunatic fringe" describe extreme leftists day, concept New Nationalism—in activist government built vibrant capitalism, partly regulating big business—looked back Alexander Hamilton, Karl Marx. Nor Wilson Bolshevik; fact, 1917 sent American troops Russia support anti-Bolshevik White Army. At home, reforms sought break monopolies order restore competition among small companies. "If America free enterprise," Wilson declared, "then freedom sort whatever." In 2007, Beck, host "Glenn Beck," CNN's Headline News, brought show John Birch Society spokesman named Sam Antonio, warned government plot abolish U.S. borders Mexico Canada, "and eventually throughout Americas." Beck told Antonio, "When I growing up, John Birch Society—I thought bunch nuts." But now, said, "you guys starting make sense me." His guest beamed. "Yes, John Birch Society nuts," Antonio said. "We exposing truth that's many, many years." Since then, Birch Society's Web site run clips Beck's Fox broadcasts, proudly pointing similarities ideas. Last June, essay site described presentation Beck Communism America "the ultimate complete agreement Beck JBS presentations American history." Beck also praised Ezra Taft Benson, one Skousen's close associates. Benson, Secretary Agriculture President Eisenhower thirteenth president Church Jesus Christ Latter-Day Saints, gained notoriety speech 1966 denounced Democratic officeholders intellectuals (including historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.) socialists Communist sympathizers, warned "the Constitution endangered hang, were, single thread," praised John Birch Society "the effective non-church organization fight creeping socialism Godless Communism." Last June, Beck aired clip another Benson speech, intoning, "Ezra Taft Benson warned coming." The Birch Society's Web site subsequently praised Beck "getting progressively (sorry bad word choice) closer presenting American history way The John Birch Society 50 years." Beck sole representative today's multifaceted Tea Party Welch Skousen nineteen- sixties far right; recently told Times, bit disingenuously, "not involved Tea Party." Why, then, politics Skousen, Benson, John Birch Society resurgence among conservative Republicans—not Beck Tea Party heroes like Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron Angle? (Last month, Angle gave warm address "freedom conference" Salt Lake City, co-sponsored John Birch Society Skousen's old group, National Center Constitutional Studies, praising audience "mainstream America" patriots "heard call.") The columnist Frank Rich, among others, suggested election black President sowed "fears disenfranchisement among dwindling threatened minority country." There signs so: Republicans' singling Thurgood Marshall "activist Justice" Elena Kagan's Supreme Court confirmation hearings, warnings Fox News terrible dangers posed minuscule New Black Panther Party. But "socialist" racial slur. Jim Crow built fears Federal Reserve I.R.S. The Tea Party's fulminations cap-and-trade, federal-government bailouts, big government generally play old themes nothing color President Obama's skin. The current right-wing resurgence inner dynamics American conservatism past half century. In nineteen-fifties nineteen-sixties, far right condemned liberals, might expected; November, 1961, President Kennedy devoted part speech Los Angeles denouncing "discordant voices extremism" "equate Democratic Party welfare state, welfare state socialism, socialism Communism." But Bircher right also provoked deep anxiety among conservatives, feared perceived paranoids conspiracy-mongers. The leading intellectual spokesman organizer anti-Bircher conservatives William F. Buckley, Jr., editor National Review. Buckley means moderate conservatism. He lifelong defender Joseph McCarthy foe New Deal liberalism. But drew line claiming course American government set socialist conspiracy, feared ravings extreme right would cost balanced, practical conservatives chance national power. "By 1961," biographer John B. Judis writes, "Buckley beginning worry John Birch Society growing rapidly, right-wing upsurge country would take ugly, even Fascist turn rather leading toward kind conservatism National Review promoted." In next two decades, Buckley's support counsel, Richard Nixon Ronald Reagan completed conservative revolution succeeded keeping extremist elements far centers power. As confidant adviser leading conservative politicians, Buckley far political influence might expected editor weekly journal. Yet early nineteen-sixties found fighting Birchers fellow-travellers extremely difficult. Even though Buckley's colleagues National Review thought Birch Society went far, would attack society publicly, fear alienating Birchers conservatives sympathized views. When Buckley wrote editorial 1962 accused Welch "distorting reality" failing make "the crucial moral political distinction" Communists liberals, magazine immediately lost subscriptions financial support. By 1960, Senator Barry Goldwater, Arizona, emerging great political hope conservative Republicans, consulted closely Buckley. At meeting Breakers hotel, Palm Beach, January, 1962, Buckley urged Goldwater repudiate Birch Society. Goldwater demurred; though conceded embarrassing "kooks" lurked among Birchers, insisted Buckley also "nice guys," would injudicious attack group public. The Birchers' support helped gain Goldwater Republican Presidential nomination 1964, winked acceptance speech famous line: "Extremism defense liberty vice. . . . Moderation pursuit justice virtue." In general election, though, Goldwater suffered crushing loss Lyndon Johnson, partly Democrats succeeded making look like captive loony right. (To Goldwater slogan "In Your Heart, You Know He's Right," Democrats shot back, "In Your Guts, You Know He's Nuts.") Buckley's fears confirmed. But undeterred efforts build respectable viable conservative movement. In 1967, favored Richard Nixon among field Republican aspirants. He liked Ronald Reagan's politics, considered Reagan, recently elected governor California, new national politics. George Romney, governor Michigan, wishy- washy moderate, obviously unsuitable, say nothing Republican archliberal Nelson Rockefeller, New York. Nixon hard-nosed Republican strong conservative views, especially Communism Cold War; established Communist-hunter nineteen-forties pressing charge Alger Hiss, former official State Department, spied Soviets. And, promisingly, Nixon front-runner. "It seems ought real chance winning year," Buckley wrote Goldwater around time Republican National Convention. He served campaign adviser, aiding friend Frank Shakespeare, taken charge Nixon's media operations. But Buckley's candidate reputation shiftiness made unpopular across political spectrum. Some editors National Review, recalling Nixon cut deal Rockefeller order secure G.O.P. nomination 1960, didn't sufficiently trust him. And Birch Society nothing contempt figure Welch called one "the slipperiest politicians ever showed American scene." As President, 1969, Nixon began open diplomatic relations Communist China, right wing placed list perfidious appeasers. When visited Beijing 1972, even Buckley deeply offended. But general election took place later year, antiwar Democratic candidate, George McGovern, voicing country's anxieties Vietnam, Buckley mainstream called "responsible conservatism" returned Nixon. The purist conservatives left back third-party candidacy John Schmitz, Republican congressman member John Birch Society. Nixon won landslide, next year appointed Buckley American delegate United Nations. The conservative pragmatists found way real power. And, despite embarrassment Watergate, Nixon's second term, strategy proved effective time. Nixon's campaign McGovern sharpened Democrats' internal divisions civil rights Vietnam, and, Buckley wrote, revealed Democrats "an indifference toward national independence hostility toward national freedom." Meanwhile, Buckley mainstream, read Birchers conservative movement, established permanent growing force Republican Party national politics. In 1976, Buckley National Review supported Ronald Reagan's primary challenge Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford. After two terms governor, Reagan matured Buckley considered nearly ideal conservative politician: shrewd leader well man principle. Reagan nearly succeeded wresting nomination Ford, demonstrating formidable national figure become. The Bircher right flourished political bastion Orange County, Reagan adept winning extremists' allegiance pursued realistic strategies. His pragmatic side showed immediately finally secured Republican nomination 1980, chose relatively moderate George H. W. Bush, bitter foe primaries, running mate. Though decision dismayed right-wing ideologues, two practical benefits: instantly healed divisions Republican moderates conservatives, helped dampen charges Democrats Reagan reckless right- winger. Nobody pleased Bush's selection fellow Skull Bones man William F. Buckley, understood political logic clearly Reagan had. As President, Reagan flattered extremists—he even delivered admiring words Skousen's Freemen Institute—but saved political capital real goals: undoing fiscal underpinnings New Deal-style government, redirecting U.S. foreign policy battling Soviet Union proxies around world. He appointed moderates positions importance, made James Baker III, Bush's close associate, first chief staff, rather far ideological Edwin Meese III, former chief staff California. (As top policy adviser, Meese helped Reagan stack federal bench conservatives, otherwise eclipsed Baker Baker's deputy, pragmatic Reaganite Michael Deaver, crusade, Attorney General, roll back civil-rights legislation largely failed.) When zealots Administration exposed, Iran-Contra scandal, Reagan skillfully evaded responsibility replaced centrist Republicans. And, recognized Mikhail Gorbachev Soviet leader could undertake genuine efforts reduce nuclear threat, Reagan pushed forward, ignoring complaints become, hard-liner Howard Phillips's phrase, "a useful idiot Soviet propaganda." Whatever misgivings may arisen right, Reagan achieved dramatic conservative overhaul federal tax code, profound reconfiguring judiciary, near-victory West Cold War. From standpoint mainstream right, problem legacy Republican could come close matching public appeal political savvy. For party Reagan, departure beginning long decline, absence similarly totemic figure, past twenty years, allowed current resurgence extremism. George H. W. Bush repelled right-wingers moderate tendencies—not least when, face fiscal calamity, broke campaign pledge raise taxes. Bill Clinton inspired almost ecstatic series attacks, though remained enough older conservative establishment, personified Senator Bob Dole, check wildest charges, new Republican House majority 1994, pushed ideologues Tom DeLay Dick Armey, little interest maintaining center. They harassed Clinton, forcing impeachment even though polls showed sixty per cent American people disapproved. George W. Bush seemed first bit Reagan's conservative charisma, right wing turned failing win war Iraq, moderate position immigration, spending hundreds millions federal dollars combat financial collapse 2008. When William F. Buckley died, 2008 primary season, seemed symbolize end conservative era. David Klinghoffer, former literary editor National Review, lamented "urbane visionaries builders institutions" Buckley replaced media figures "who make money stirring fears resentments." Conservatism, Klinghoffer added, "has undergone shift toward demagoguery hucksterism," ruled called "the crazy-cons." Some Republicans tried extend Buckley tradition, little effect. The commentator David Frum, former speechwriter George W. Bush, lost job American Enterprise Institute complained Republicans' obstruction health-care reform called right-wing surge threat conservatism. In June, congressman Bob Inglis, South Carolina, tough conservative nonetheless backed Bush's financial bailout, lost vicious primary fight right-wing insurgent named Trey Gowdy. To amazement, Inglis confronted campaign trail voters convinced numbers Social Security cards indicated secret bank bought birth. "And then, course," recalls, "it turned something Federal Reserve Bilderbergers stuff." Not even Karl Rove afford open dissent Tea Partiers. Appearing Fox News night recent primaries, described Tea Party-backed Senate candidate Delaware, Christine O'Donnell, probably unelectable said statements "nutty." Instantly, criticism came Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh, right-wing Republicans. Within days, back Fox, proclaiming "a huge Tea Party fan," endorsing O'Donnell, affirming National Republican Senatorial Committee would give full backing. So far, Rove, unlikely dissident, prominent Republican leader much gesture stepping forward, Buckley allies did. Even strong conservatives like Inglis pushed aside, former G.O.P. stalwarts Charlie Crist, Florida, Mike Castle, Delaware, beaten primaries Tea Party candidates; Grist running long-shot campaign Independent. Desperate gains midterm elections, Republicans neglecting struggle took make politics safe Reagan. Fifty years ago, President Kennedy deplored far right's "counsels fear suspicion." Today, Obama's White House still struggling make sense enemies. In absence forthright leadership, right left, job standing extremists appears left electorate. Candidates like O'Donnell may prove eccentric prevail, voters may simply become disillusioned politicians campaign hatred government. After election, mainstream conservatives may well engage Richard Viguerie forecast "a massive, almost historic battle heart soul Republican Party." (Already, Rove leading Bush political operatives, including former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie, quietly supplanting battered G.O.P. establishment effort raise funds year's candidates.) But, according recent poll, seventy per cent Republicans support Tea Party, seems almost certain Republican Party unstintingly appeased far right enjoy strong perhaps smashing victory coming midterm elections. In 1906, early Progressive era, humorist Finley Peter Dunne's fictional barroom sage, Mr. Dooley, put social political tumult day perspective. "Th' noise ye hear th' first gun iv revolution," Dooley remarked. "It's on'y th' people iv th' United States batin' carpet." A century now, even year now, Americans may say Tea Party. For moment, though, appears extreme right wing verge securing degree power Congress Republican Party unprecedented modern American history. For defenders national cohesion tempered adversity politics, alarming state affairs. • Read http://www.newyorker.com/reportinq/2010/10/18/101018fa fact wilentz?printable=true#ixzz123hWc5bz
