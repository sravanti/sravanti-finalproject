Tuesday, April 14, 2009 For us, Haiti neighbor. For others, place historic cultural ties. For us, test collective commitment resolve. Some may ask small nation middle Caribbean Sea command attention today. Why countries Western Hemisphere, Europe, Middle East Asia offer assistance Haiti midst global economic downturn shaken us all. We're gathered conference happens Haiti resound far beyond Caribbean beyond Americas. The success failure one small nation economic, social political implications, 9 million citizens, region whose future shaped strength commitment achieve economic recovery, political progress wider opportunity people Portland Porto Alegre Port-au-Prince. The United States here, first foremost, right thing neighbor friend. Our ties Haiti reach back early years nations endured generations-through struggles independence; defeat slavery Haiti, inspired slaves abolitionists U.S. press fight freedom; recently, hundreds thousands Haitians emigrated United States strengthened contributions politics, business, science, sports culture-the benefits I experienced firsthand senator representing New York. We also committed creating hemisphere every nation-no matter present level wealth current political circumstances-is moving direction, toward greater peace, prosperity, freedom opportunity. With Haiti, chance global cooperation collaboration stand solidarity people seeking march forward. A nation small investments assistance countries beginning reap dividends economic growth, wider access health care, stronger governmental institutions, greater safety security-and higher quality life results material conditions people's lives improve. Today, Haiti poorest nation hemisphere, one region's biggest gaps haves have- nots. But 2006, Haiti highest economic growth since 1990s. It track reach completion point IMF's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative next months, means significant debt relief way, free approximately $4 million month-money Haiti invest directly improving lives people building future self-sufficiency confidence. Haiti region's highest rate HIV/AIDS, highest rate maternal mortality, highest rate child mortality. But numbers HIV infections child maternal deaths coming down. Not long ago, Haiti endured three decades brutal dictatorship. But national presidential elections 2006 jump-started Haiti's democracy, President Preval Prime Minister Pierre Louis seeking maintain strong commitment democratic governance, take another step forward Sunday elections Senate. Like many nations, including United States, Haiti struggles crime, particularly global scourge drug trafficking. But reforms improve policing, strengthen justice system fight corruption underway, peacekeeping force led Brazil helped bring stability many Haitian communities. Haiti made strides help citizens many nations institutions represented today. And progress come government-to-government partnerships, also links among businesses, universities, NG0s, religious cultural groups, individuals-the full range resources relationships, heart smart power. That trajectory progress undermined combined winds hurricanes global economic recession. Haiti danger stalling. This conference gives us opportunity reignite path progress work team-with Haiti helm-to advance comprehensive, long-term strategy Haiti's growth, coordinating hemispheric international efforts, targeting clear goals, deploying diverse skills resources efficiently effectively. President Preval Prime Minister Pierre Louis identified help Haiti needs get back track. With priorities guide Haiti partner, make high-impact investments help lay foundation stronger democratic institutions, vibrant civil society, open market economy creates stability, attracts international investment, offers jobs wider economic opportunities Haiti region whole. Now time step investment Haiti-not situation dire, consequences inaction could lead significantly larger costs human financial terms road. With $100, pay year schooling one Haitian child immunize five. That's tiny fraction cost solving problems escalate time. The United States target support toward three areas Haitian government requested, aimed promoting conditions essential national regional progress. First, Haitian people need secure. They must able travel safely work school participate civic lives communities without fear violence. Second, country needs stronger infrastructure, particularly roads, circulatory system robust economy. Meanwhile, people Haiti ready work, jobs short supply. We accomplish two things putting people work building roads infrastructure throughout Haiti. And third, last year's hurricanes blew hole government's budget. Now Haiti facing huge deficit, make harder provide services short-term fund major projects long-term. Their debt obligations constrain ability lay groundwork future. On issues-security, jobs infrastructure, debt relief-the United States lending assistance seeking partner nations maximize collective impact. First, security. Effective international partnerships already helped stem violence improve security Haiti. Cite Soleil, example, no-man's-land years, today, violence subsided new sense freedom felt streets. The Haitian National Police supported work UN peacekeeping operation Haiti, first hemisphere Latin American Caribbean nations participated. Brazil led mission determination skill. This level engagement collaboration major step forward region. But criminal networks operating Haiti eliminated. Haiti continues fight drug traffickers made country distribution point illegal drugs headed United States, Canada Europe. Drug trafficking problem involves many nations, role play ending deadly trade. That includes United States. We give $2 million fight drug trafficking Haiti Merida Initiative, plan conceived Mexico, Central America United States. This money fund secure communications network Haitian police; provide maritime base, vehicles operational support police drug units; provide training promote cross-border cooperation Haiti Dominican Republic; sharpen investigation prosecution drug crimes. Once security established, opportunity take root. Nations Canada Spain Japan offered generous assistance help repair damage last year's storms. Now time take next step-to move beyond peacekeeping disaster relief long-term reconstruction development. Haiti highest unemployment rate hemisphere; 70 percent people don't jobs. It also one region's highest population growth rates. Together, trends created one development expert called "youth tsunami"-nearly 1 million youths expected come job market next five years. To spur creation jobs, United States passed HOPE Act 2006, give garments made Haiti tariff-free access U.S. market. Last October, extended trade preference another decade. Apparel one largest sectors Haiti's economy. We see great potential job creation field, gratified Brazil's interest supporting Haitian apparel industry well. But build diversified economy, Haiti needs trade deals. It also needs infrastructure support flow goods services. The roads Haiti beyond inadequate; many communities isolated lack passable road, prevents people holding jobs, children going school, farmers bringing crops market. Better roads could facilitate greater trade bring Haitians global economy. Haiti also needs better roads tourist areas, promote sector economy. Other urgent infrastructure needs include digging water catchments prevent floods, completing garment workers' training center, creating canals help irrigation. As part $287 million non-emergency assistance provide Haiti year, authorized $20 million aid generate jobs, help people put skills work building country's future. We look forward working Haiti distribute money quickly effectively, trigger virtuous circle long-term economic growth. All fiscal responsibility world can't prevent natural disaster. The hurricanes didn't wash away crops houses; also washed away months government planning future. Haiti facing approximately $50 million budget deficit, could undermine Haiti's long-term ambitions well services people depend survive. The United States provide $20 million pay Haiti's upcoming debt service obligations, free Haiti use resources fill budget gap. [There fourth urgent need United States committed helping Haiti resolve. The combined effect rising food prices globally destruction crops hurricanes exposed millions Haitians malnutrition destructive effects health productivity. Malnourished people often weak work; chronically hungry children struggle learn school. Food insecurity source suffering, direct threat economic growth global stability. The United States provide $15-million in-kind contribution food help Haiti continues rebuild. ] These ways United States ready partner Haiti nations. But additional pieces larger mission need support-from helping Haiti adapt climate change future hurricanes won't claim thousands lives; strengthening health systems; promoting sustainable agriculture; developing civil society. This work matter governments, also mission people. Here U.S., I heard many individuals groups care Haiti want help develop don't know invest time money way make real impact. We think creatively helping people outside government get involved meaningful way Haiti's future. Our people valuable resource, potential help places like Haiti yet tapped. We know empirical data small investments go long way. This something I've seen visits Haiti. I traveled husband shortly wedding, years later First Lady. I met doctor emigrated United States became U.S. Air Force Colonel, returned home town Pignon run center health, women's literacy microcredit. He staff resources, offered comprehensive range services thousands clients. I visited family-planning clinic young people trained educate peers protect health prevent teen pregnancy. And I met women group called Women Democracy. These women attended global conference women's leadership Montevideo, Uruguay, returned home, created organization support Haitian women running office. Eleven years later, organization larger stronger ever, mission. In addition supporting women candidates, also hold trade fairs women entrepreneurs, run civic education programs teach women rights, support women journalists, build connections women throughout Caribbean. These Haitian women remind us never achieve real progress leave millions people behind. And demonstrate powerful commitment part Haitian people participate lead nation's recovery. Our role support work however can, demonstrate actions belief future important own. What happens next Haiti send message world power collaboration behalf every poor nation worked hard earn foothold global economy tumbled recent months. On behalf every man woman hemisphere, northern expanses Canada southern tip Argentina, working harder ever fewer resources smaller rewards. children whose futures jeopardized forces far beyond control. let us prove commitment economic recovery reaches citizens individual nations people everywhere.
