Krugman, case haven't seen: January 1, 2010 Op-Ed Columnist Chinese New Year By PAUL KRUGMAN It's season pundits traditionally make predictions year ahead. Mine concerns international economics: I predict 2010 year China. And good way. Actually, biggest problems China involve climate change. But today I want focus currency policy. China become major financial trade power. But doesn't act like big economies. Instead, follows mercantilist policy, keeping trade surplus artificially high. And today's depressed world, policy is, put bluntly, predatory. Here's works: Unlike dollar, euro yen, whose values fluctuate freely, China's currency pegged official policy 6.8 yuan dollar. At exchange rate, Chinese manufacturing large cost advantage rivals, leading huge trade surpluses. Under normal circumstances, inflow dollars surpluses would push value China's currency, unless offset private investors heading way. And private investors trying get China, it. But China's government restricts capital inflows, even buys dollars parks abroad, adding $2 trillion-plus hoard foreign exchange reserves. This policy good China's export-oriented state-industrial complex, good Chinese consumers. But rest us? In past, China's accumulation foreign reserves, many invested American bonds, arguably us favor keeping interest rates low — although low interest rates mainly inflate housing bubble. But right world awash cheap money, looking someplace go. Short-term interest rates close zero; long-term interest rates higher, investors expect zero-rate policy end day. China's bond purchases make little difference. Meanwhile, trade surplus drains much-needed demand away depressed world economy. My back-of-the- envelope calculations suggest next couple years Chinese mercantilism may end reducing U.S. employment around 1.4 million jobs. The Chinese refuse acknowledge problem. Recently Wen Jiabao, prime minister, dismissed foreign complaints: "On one hand, asking yuan appreciate, hand, taking kinds protectionist measures." Indeed: countries taking (modest) protectionist measures precisely China refuses let currency rise. And measures entirely appropriate. Or they? I usually hear two reasons confronting China policies. Neither holds water. First, there's claim can't confront Chinese would wreak havoc U.S. economy dumping hoard dollars. This wrong, Chinese would inflict large losses themselves. The larger point forces make Chinese mercantilism damaging right also mean China little financial leverage. Again, right world awash cheap money. So China start selling dollars, there's reason think would significantly raise U.S. interest rates. It would probably weaken dollar currencies — would good, bad, U.S. competitiveness employment. So Chinese dump dollars, send thank-you note.
