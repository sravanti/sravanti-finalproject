The English version follows: If raid Gaza Freedom Flotilla disaster Israel Defense Forces, aftermath demonstrated equally bewildering performance Israeli media. The IDF Spokesman's Office churned one misleading claim another, one implausible next, seeking implant public's mind version events bore little relation reality. To degree, expected; startling see Israel's respected reporters lined serve military stenographers, barely challenging IDF's rapidly changing versions events. IDF claims flotilla passengers' links Al Qaida, anti-Semitic statements shouted Israeli Navy, terrorist intentions eagerly broadcast Israeli media without second thought. When independent reporters forced IDF retract "clarify" claims, Israeli news outlets refused correct errors, covered without acknowledgment. It happened I arrived Israel research trip day flotilla raid. As result, I able something I always thought basic journalistic practice, basic it's supposed applied routinely: Asking implicated party story produce evidence claims. What I found bewildering least judging Israeli media reports, few, any, mainstream reporters applied practice, visiting colleague job – nobody bothered correct withdraw original report. On June 2, IDF disseminated press release entitled, "Attackers IDF soldiers found Al Qaeda mercenaries." The accusation accompanied conclusive evidence — IDF reported Mavi Marmara passengers equipped night-vision goggles (gasp!). This stop Yedioth's Ron Ben-Yishai, embedded Navy commandos, amplifying baseless charge. Citing "interrogation" Marmara passengers — "lynchers," called — Ben-Yishai wrote day, "Some among [flotilla passengers] believed ties World Jihad groups, mainly Al Qaeda." The article made reference efforts part Ben Yishai investigate claim, seem think ask IDF release dangerous operatives Osama Bin Laden — presumably would attack again, wouldn't they? • On June 3, Israeli journalist Lia Tarachansky Real News Network I placed calls IDF Spokesman's Office demand evidence Marmara's Al Qaeda ties. We received identical responses spokespeople IDF's Israel North America desks: "We don't evidence. The press release based information National Security Council." Hours later, IDF retracted claim, changing title press release to, "Attackers IDF Soldiers Found Without Identification Papers." Despite official retraction, Ben-Yishai's article remains uncorrected. On June 4, IDF released audio clip purporting consist transmissions Mavi Marmara Naval warship. "Go back Aushwitz!" Marmara passenger shouted, according IDF. YNet Haaretz reported reproduced audio clip without investigating authenticity. Forget voice uttering anti-Semitic slur sounded like mentally disturbed teenager; reporters performed cursory search IDF Spokeman's Office website, would found longer clip released May 31 featured dramatically different exchange Marmara mention Auschwitz. Further, voice flotilla organizer Huwaida Arraf featured "Aushwitz" clip, yet Arraf aboard Marmara (she Challenger One). Could IDF doctored audio exploit public hysteria surrounding issue anti-Semitism? On blog, I pointed discrepancies IDF's footage raised question doctoring. The next day, IDF conceded fact doctored footage, releasing "clarification" new clip claiming consist "full" exchange Navy flotilla. Unfortunately, authenticity new clip impossible verify. Despite IDF's admission, YNet Haaretz corrected original reports, though Haaretz least altered headline. Once doctoring exposed, New York Times covered episode detail, directing international attention triumph independent online reporting apparent failure Israel's parochial press corps. On June 7, Haaretz's Anshel Pfeffer reported IDF press release claiming without evidence five flotilla passengers links international terror. The press release larded highly implausible claims, including Ken O'Keefe, runs aid organization Tony Blair's sister-in-law, planning train Hamas commando unit Gaza Strip. When I called IDF Spokesman's Office, I learned again, evidence available support press release. "There limited intelligence give specific case," Sgt. Chen Arad told me. "Obviously I'm unable give information." Did Pfeffer demand evidence? If answered manner I did, Haaretz publish unsubstantiated spin fact? Joined Haaretz military correspondents Avi Isacharoff Amos Harel, Pfeffer became channel another daytime deception IDF. On May 31, three reporters produced article based exclusively testimony Naval commandos — flotilla passengers' side story ignored — claiming faced live fire lynching attempts Marmara passengers. Since story published, IDF produced scant evidence support either accusation. The article accompanied suspicious photo IDF Spokesman's Office depicting bearded Muslim man brandishing knife surrounded photojournalists. Daylight beamed window behind man. Haaretz's caption, sourced IDF, asserted photo taken "after" commandos boarded Marmara. However, commandos raided ship night, photo taken day. Once again, IDF's story fishy. I called Sgt. Arad IDF Spokesman's Office investigate. He told evidence support photo's questionable caption. Soon phone conversation, Haaretz quietly altered caption, removing claim photo taken "after" commando raid. For nearly week, false photo caption remained intact. Why Haaretz suddenly change it? The plausible explanation paper received tip IDF Spokesman's Office. If true, tip-off suggests scandalous level coordination Israeli military country's media. In wake flotilla raid, Israeli journalists unique opportunity lead global media's investigation bloodbath occurred deck Mavi Marmara. After all, one better access military eyewitnesses aboard flotilla. Instead, many among Israeli press corps allowed conscripted IDF's hapless information war, leaving important task investigating raid independent reporters remembered view claims nation's military extreme skepticism. So well-connected, experienced reporters follow IDF baton willingly, fail follow IDF claims retracted? Is simple bias, desire present military best possible light, desire strong abandon duty readers verify information? Are afraid sanctions, losing contacts access information? Do fear personal reprisals? Their readers, world media still relies Israeli journalism vital source information, need know.
