Jerry, may recall, Guiliani's homeland security guy NYC became B6 one world's experts. He also worked Clinton Admn helped disaster relief (including earthquakes) around world. He called today suggestions (some may moot), I asked put memo. Here is, it's worth: I think fundamental issue one seems charge one person tasked trying pull pieces together short term long term plan. Obviously short term, search rescue food water main priorities. There seems little communication various areas people congregated central command post agencies call radio additional supplies including food, water medical. I don't recommend DoD put charge this. They rarely kind touch brings together necessary agencies one roof. I would set central command representatives federal agencies one place. There reason things disorganized. I would break island grids assign one person coordinator grids. That person responsible activities within grid report activities island on-scene coordinator. We get radio company like Motorola set temporary towers give State Department several hundred radios everyone involved response able communicate command post other. I think one important roles DoD provide security rescue teams medical teams. They also responsible operation airport, loading planes scheduling incoming flights lost time waiting planes land. I also think DoD responsible airlifting supplies requested one grid coordinators. Additionally, helicopters used move critical patients hospital ship way aircraft carrier currently station. At least day, coordinator assigned President Secretary State responsible getting situation reports agencies site, particularly regarding food water, security, medical search rescue. The lack command control allowing situation become chaotic rather coordinated. I believe Secretary talk nations involved UN, would supportive better coordination. Bottom line order operation need strong people speak behalf President Secretary get things control quickly. I hope helpful. If Secretary questions please feel free call cell We leave Tokyo 7:15 tomorrow transfer United flight due back DC 2:30 pm tomorrow. Please give Secretary best regards. I hope see soon. B6
