sbwhoeop Monday, February 22, 2010 5:40 PM H: Just fyi. What's going around...Les Gelb... Sid ambling Over Rahm Leslie H. Gelb February 22, 2010 I 3:26pm - L - Alex Brandon / AP Photo Leslie H. Gelb's call White House Chief Staff Rahm Emanuel reassigned spurred circle-the-wagons reaction pro- (or perhaps even anti-) Rahm forces. Gelb sifts fallout clues. When write president United States replace chief staff, someone fire back. So Rahm Emanuel apparently struck back piece last week Daily Beast column Sunday's Washington Post. Only time, return fire rare twist, one could produce Washington convulsions. It seemingly aimed (and others published suggestions Emanuel's limitations chief). But whether intentional not, volley actually struck president himself. Here story, Washington tale stretching permissible criticism power holders, pungent media leaks, labyrinthine speculation whom. Maybe leaker thought way get rid Rahm completely brand "traitor" boss. With headline "Replace Rahm," I wrote last Tuesday Emanuel lacked managerial skills, discipline, strategic ability get things done chief staff. I argued moved political adviser slot, considerable, can-do talents would better serve boss. I targeted others well, mostly Mr. Obama's Chicago crowd. Several writers also blasted crowd, mostly unsigned bullets, never crossed red line calling removal. I wrote piece essentially reflected waves anti-White House staff critiques breaking Washington, rarely heard outside drawing rooms. I I believed president running chances succeed needed better tougher staffers. I failed, nation failed. Then came inevitable blast back, devastating leak, piece Dana Milbank, respected Washington journalist. Interesting leaker selected Milbank. He's sort half-reporter, half-columnist roams entire capital city, White House. The leaker must felt safe Milbank many sources town, making leakers harder trace. The Milbank headline read: "Why Obama needs Rahm top." It began: "Let us praise Rahm Emanuel. No, seriously." Then, lists couple others also criticized Rahm. "But," continued, "sacking Emanuel last thing president do." Then, Milbank (and presumably leaker) delivered surprise wounding blow – president himself. "Obama's first year fell apart large part didn't follow chief staffs advice crucial matters. Arguably, Emanuel person keeping Obama becoming Jimmy Carter." Then, Milbank (and leaker) took first shot, me, congressional liberals everyone Chicago crowd except Rahm. "Obama's problem," Milbank continued, "is confidants—particularly Valerie Jarrett Robert Gibbs, and, lesser extent, David Axelrod—are part Cult Obama. In love president, believe transformational figure needn't dirty hands politics." So, "their" fault—until see real blow landed beyond President himself. "The president would better heeding Emanuel's counsel," instead "overruled" several key Rahm recommendations: rushing close Guantanamo bringing terrorists U.S. prisons, trying Khalid Sheikh Mohammed New York, going smaller health care bill focused popular items Republican support. "The result was," Milbank wrote, "as world knows, disastrous." In words, Mr. Obama could thrived saved key issues listened Rahm. It sure looks like Rahm (or someone near dear him) trying save president's expense. This incredibly unusual leak, seemingly chief staff undermining boss, president. Worse, details specific advice Rahm personally gave Mr. Obama absolute privacy Oval Office. Presidents go crazy breaches confidence. Which another possibility considered: Rahm leaker. The leak egregious, anti- Chicago crowd minus Rahm, devastating president, Emanuel couldn't stupid enough leak story sole, surviving hero. Remember, too, piece recommend kicking Rahm White House, sliding political adviser job could practice small-bite pragmatism. Maybe someone didn't want Rahm around White House all, position. Maybe leaker thought way get rid Rahm completely brand "traitor" boss. Maybe leaker belonged contingent self- mutilating liberal Democrats always viewed Rahm centrist pragmatic. Of course, I don't know what's afoot. And course, Milbank put views article. But someone gave specifics, precious ammunition Rahm's private advice Mr. Obama. The story over. Leslie H.
