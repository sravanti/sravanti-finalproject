Stanley A. McChrystal granting McChrystal's request double size Afghan army police. Cost factor, questions whether capacity exists train 400,000 personnel. The president told McChrystal, top commander U.S. NATO forces Afghanistan, focus fielding little half number next October. Ten days Obama's speech, U.S. command responsible training Afghans circulated chart detailing combined personnel targets army police. McChrystal's goal 400,000 remained unchanged. "It's open issue," senior Pentagon official said last week. Nearly month Obama unveiled revised Afghanistan strategy, military civilian leaders come away differing views several fundamental aspects president's new approach, according dozen senior administration military officials involved Afghanistan policy, spoke condition anonymity discuss internal deliberations. Members Obama's war cabinet disagree meaning pledge begin drawing forces July 2011 whether mission narrowed proposal advanced McChrystal August assessment war. The disagreements opened fault line desire early exit among several senior officials White House conviction among military commanders victory still achievable terms. The differences complicating implementation new strategy. Some officers responded July 2011 date seeking accelerate pace operations, instead narrowing them. At White House, senior administration official said, National Security Council discussing ways increase monitoring military State Department activities Afghanistan prevent "overreaching." The NSC's strategic guidance, classified document outlines president's new approach, described senior administration official limiting military operations "in scale scope minimum required achieve two goals -- prevent ai-Qaeda safe havens prevent Taliban toppling government." The use resource- intensive counterinsurgency tactics -- employing U.S. forces protect Afghan civilians Taliban -- supposed restricted key cities towns southern eastern parts country, official said. "The strategy fundamentally changed. This COIN strategy," Vice President Biden said MSNBC last week, using military's shorthand counterinsurgency. "This 'go occupy whole country.' " Setting limits During videoconference two days speech, Obama made clear McChristal U.S. Ambassador Karl W. Eikenberry want additional troops fuel broader mission. Speaking men White House Situation Room, president told deploy forces areas would able transfer Afghan security forces July 2011, according two senior officials knowledge conversation. Obama's essential instruction was, according one officials, "Don't bite chew." White House officials said president opposes using forces authorized duplicate expansive, iraq-style counterinsurgency operation -- part questions whether possible achieve similar outcome Afghanistan, less developed, wants start reducing troops 18 months. The White House's desired end state Afghanistan, officials said, envisions informal local security arrangements Iraq, less- capable national government greater tolerance insurgent violence. Senior military officials still think achieve better outcome envisaged civilian skeptics administration using new forces mount comprehensive counterinsurgency operations. Although Pentagon strategists McChrystal's advisers Kabul looking fulfill White House desire less extensive mission, military officials said reluctant strip much away weaken approach come revered within ranks way suppress guerrilla movements. Military officials contend McChrystal harbor expansionist aims. They note begun removing troops remote mountain valleys concentrating resources modest number key population centers. But approach areas involve counterinsurgency tactics: Troops focus restoring normal patterns life trying keep Taliban bay, helping Afghan government provide basic services population training local security forces. McChrystal's plan, senior Pentagon official said, "is still counterinsurgency, regardless various agendas people trying spin." Dissent drawdown During strategy discussions White House, differences White House military came sharp relief °baffle's decision announce intention begin drawing troops July 2011. McChrystal argued it, according three officials familiar process. The head U.S. Central Command, Gen. David H. Petraeus, also expressed concerns. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates urged Obama make drawdoWn "conditions-based." "There lot push back" Defense Department, one officials said. The president received cover one uniformed general table, James E. Cartwright, vice chairman Joint Chiefs Staff. Cartwright adopted skeptical view mission many military colleagues, one resonated Obama Biden. Cartwright effectively endorsed July 2011 date, arguing increasing forces engaging limited counterinsurgency made sense, senior administration official said, "but given risk factors -- Pakistan, Karzai government, whole notion sub-national governance track record [Afghan security forces], prestigious -- made sense demonstrate could actually this." It. also helped Obama principal troop-increase proposal discussed time -- recommendation McChrystal receive 30,000 forces 18 24 months -- developed Gates. The Defense Department paperwork detailing proposal identified increase starting summer 2009, first troops deployed president year began conducting operations Afghanistan, specify end date. "Rather leaving indefinite hypothetical, president's intervention say, 'Okay, we're starting July '09, we're really talking July '11," said senior administration official described NSC guidance. Obama eventually told war cabinet would announce July 2011 deadline pace withdrawals would determined, Gates sought, conditions ground. Obama said would conduct thorough review progress year's time. Although endorse McChrystal's request increase Afghan security forces 400,000, said would reevaluate issue 2010 goal training 230,000 forces achieved. The president avoided details Dec. 1 address, leaving members Cabinet advisers explain specifics. The result wide divergence expectations. Gates, appearing NBC's "Meet Press" Sunday speech, said perhaps "some handful small number" would withdrawn. Biden, MSNBC appearance last week, said chart showing increase U.S. deployments year would "coming rapidly next two years." The ambiguity meaning July 2011 deadline generated uncertainty presidents intent. "Is surge way helping us leave quickly, timeline way help win support surge?" asked senior Democratic staff member Congress. "Which strategy head-fake? Nobody knows." One senior military officer Afghanistan said fellow soldiers "don't know 18 months, whether progress report leads minor changes." "Until tell us otherwise," officer said, "we're operating latter policy." A 'dramatic change'? Although senior-level civilians administration emerged review process thinking mission circumscribed, senior military officials continue different view. The result, see it, White House embraced McChrystal's original plan. "We already pretty focused wouldn't try clear hold things needed to," said senior commander involved war. "It wasn't dramatic change means." White House officials cited meeting among NSC staff members McChrystal general displayed slide stating mission "Defeat Taliban," civilians deemed overly ambitious suggested every last member Taliban would killed captured. The officials said mission redefined avoid term. But military officers, defeat "doesn't mean wipe everyone out," commander said. "It means Waterloo, Napoleon still army wasn't going threaten Europe. We used view worked defeat." Even White House review finished, commander charge day-to-day operations, Lt. Gen. David M. Rodriguez, developed plan concentrate U.S. NATO efforts 80 country's nearly 400 districts. "They're taking credit things McChrystal already calling narrowed focus," senior military official said. White House advisers maintain review process refine mission beyond McChrystal proposed summer. "There real narrowing here," senior administration official said. "Stan big leadership task adapt original concept new strategic guidance." The official said NSC officials recognize take time new orders filter ranks. "This doesn't turn around speech," official said. "But I hope don't see slides month continue state goal 400,000" Afghan security forces. The challenge, said official another senior administration official, recalibrate military operations next 18 months accordance new goal. "The guidance we're everything, we're forever," second official said. "The hardest intellectual exercise settling much enough." For now, however, top military officers speak expansively White House advisers. "Winning means hand security force secure country," senior Pentagon official said. "We've separated enemy, we've connected people government, we're helping rebuild economy. It's point begin transition them." Terms "winning" "victory" eschewed White House. Obama use either Dec. 1 address, said interview earlier year uncomfortable using term "victory" fighting "a non-state actor, shadowy operation like al-Qaeda." But Gates visited Kabul week Obama's speech, made point telling military personnel "we thing win." "From moral perspective, ask soldiers families sacrifice, win," Pentagon official said. "We need able articulate winning."
