Jake probably passed you, case, I think it's definitely worth reading A comments one staff members long experience Middle East follow. From Martin: The principle conclusion quick visit Israel Ramallah weekend Netanyahu strong position politically, unusually stable ruling coalition. Nobody I spoke believed government would fallen decided extend settlement freeze expiry, gesture U.S. peacemaking efforts. In view, could easily garnered support large majority people, settlers marginal concern. And would given leverage ministers ensure support abstention cabinet. As Dan Meridor noted, Likud voters left Knesset members comes peacemaking (70 percent support two-state solution, vs 50 percent leadership). Lieberman, Likud, Bibi's chief concern. He wants keep government long possible fear leaves garner support right, including Likud, oppose peacemaking. For time being, Bibi uses threat alternative coalition Kadima keep Lieberman tent. But clock ticking. According Tzipi Livni, bring party government now, willing without demand "rotation," provided Bibi serious negotiating peace. But elections grow closer, party members turning idea joining government. They strengthened views recent internal polling shows Kadima 32 seats (up 28 now), Likud slightly 25, Labor 5. Therefore, Bibi intends make deal Abu Mazen, need sooner rather later. The longer waits, less leverage Lieberman likely Lieberman break away oppose next elections. In context, Bibi's negotiating tactics become self-defeating. Believing great negotiator, operating Middle East bazaar, inflates requirements well beyond anything reasonable belief best way secure highest price. The process bringing reasonable price uses lot energy, uses lot goodwill, humiliates Palestinian negotiating partner, raises doubts seriousness. In end, great pressure quarters, make final concession, wasting lot time, making everybody furious him, thereby securing credit either supporters negotiating partners. At heart, seems lack generosity spirit. This combines legendary fear seen "freier" (sucker) front people create real problem negotiations, especially holds cards. This complicated introduction notion "creative ideas." Thinking box, likes do, delay negotiations box already well-defined. To attempt broaden parameters generate mistrust intentions Palestinian side direct negotiations provide opportunity build trust. The reason dwelling Bibi's psychology rather politics latter point direction making deal: Israeli public ready get it; Israel doesn't make serious move, delegitimize standing internationally (something Bibi deeply concerned about); Bibi needs President Obama corner deal threat Iran avoid punishment voters mishandling relations U.S.; doesn't make deal Abu Mazen now, helped advance future concerned - llamas takeover Palestinian leadership. Yuval Diskin quite clear latter point. After praising Palestinian security services sky (unusual him) told warned Bibi moment high motivation prevent terror believe building state. If proves illusion, motivation disappear cannot guarantee security West Bank. He considers quite possible Bibi doesn't quickly demonstrate seriousness Abu Mazen, resign honor seriously damaged. He told Bibi cannot predict lead Palestinians Abu Mazen resigns, Salam Fayyad likely go too. What done? I magic solution must deeply frustrating exercise you. And please forgive I recommend repeating already know. 1.Put arm around Bibi: still thinks bring down. There substitute working him, even though makes frustrating process. But purpose embracing nudge forward, buy exaggerated political fears accept inflated demands. 2. Try find way make understand negotiating tactics counterproductive purposes. The Obama Administration done great deal lately underscore concern Israel's security, vote IAEA, sanctions Iran, letter Obama willing sign accepted Bibi's security requirements. That buy credibility him. 3. As friend, paint realistic picture strategic consequences negotiating tactics, particularly terms likely happen PA leadership worries politics Abu Mazen's politics. 4. If else fails, avoid recriminations favor "clarifying moment." The world course blame Bibi. But avoid kind finger-pointing favor repeated commitment negotiated solution willingness engage sides trying make happen, they're ready. The Israeli public American Jewish Community know far President prepared go allowed draw conclusions. Bibi, Abu Mazen, Arab states need negotiations time side them. They come back table sooner rather later long keep door open. From staffer: AM Anne-Marie Slaughter Director Policy Planning U.S. Department State (202) 647-2972
