But Senate majority leader chatted freely two disarmingly charming book authors came office Capitol shortly 2008 election. They — tape recorder — soaking reminiscences wild campaign turned backbencher caucus president United States. Reid wasn't guard — perhaps he'd told staff meeting would "off record," according person knowledge exchange. Although Reid master Senate's mysterious inside game, he's often botched outside game one colleague calls "penchant saying things without filter." But Jim Manley, Reid's senior communications adviser, wasn't worried boss sat John Heilemann New York Magazine Mark Halperin Time magazine — two veteran reporters working publisher billed "a sweeping, novelistic, ultimately definitive portrait" 2008 race. Like virtually every Washington political insider, Manley long warm relationship Halperin, longtime political director ABC News set conventional wisdom Washington "The Note." Maybe Reid Manley — thinking back many candid exchanges years — simply assumed Halperin wouldn't burn boss. Or maybe expected Halperin would check back quotes planned use? Whatever thinking, wrong. Reid talking reasons why, even though publicly professed neutrality vicious Democratic primaries 2008, secretly encouraged then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama challenge another member caucus, then-New York Sen. Hillary Clinton. And amid talk Obama's oratorical gifts, let slip something else: Obama could win White House "light-skinned" African-American "with Negro dialect, unless wanted one."

As chagrined Reid telephoned political allies Senate civil rights community shore support weekend, made clear felt burned authors. In book's"Authors' Note," wrote: "All interviews — junior staffers candidates — conducted 'deep background' basis, means agreed identify subjects sources way.

Halperin added: "There's one talked book burned way, violated agreement with." Manley, Capitol Hill veteran also worked late Sen. Ted Kennedy, responsible monitoring interview dealing issues arising it. But didn't tell anyone else Reid's inner circle inflammatory remarks boss made; good relationship authors, assumed quotes would never made public — least without knowing first. Manley declined comment story-- wouldn't confirm interview took place. On Friday 10 p.m. — half year interview — The Atlantic's Marc Ambinder e-mailed Reid's staff questions "light-skinned" candidate without "Negro dialect." In second-guessing followed, Capitol Hill veterans said way inflammatory words Senate majority leader would remain record, even arrangement.
