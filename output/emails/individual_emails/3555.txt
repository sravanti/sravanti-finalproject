I didn't - hard believe did. I pretty surprised I read piece. Just shows it's near impossible take issue job you're it, political reporters resort manufactured drama interactions WH. Face good. Perfect generated issues clean up, networks picked clips re Iran. Gates's remark couldn't send new troops January Afghanistan seems thing approaching news. I saw WJC Meet (VERY good, lot CGI's work re women girls), I missed Paterson!
