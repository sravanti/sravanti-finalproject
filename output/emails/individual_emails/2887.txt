Apparently can't get away me. We're sharing FT op-ed page tomorrow. Here's piece.... Thanks Friday. Much favorable comment. Good luck UNGA. President Barack Obama's announcement new system.for protecting America's allies Iranian missiles ignited charges scaling back one inherited George W. Bush concession Russians. In fact, Obama plan big improvement Bush one, designed counter evolving Iranian threat, mollify Russian anxieties. Mr Bush's decision put 10 missile interceptors Poland associated radar Czech Republic based concern Iran developing long-range rockets could hit US. The Bush system would less effective shorter- range Iranian missiles, would left much Europe, notably including America's ally Turkey, unprotected. Over last several years, Iranians shifted efforts developing long-range rockets deploying large numbers shorter-range ones pose immediate danger southeastern Europe Middle East, well US forces stationed there. Unlike Mr Bush's, Mr Obama's plan quickly field missile-defence capability address existing threat. It upgraded deal longer-range Iranian missiles future. The Central Europeans reacted decision apprehension alarm recognize replacement conceptually flawed plan credible one strengthens bonds transatlantic defence. The view Moscow clouded outright paranoia. Military experts suspected US rockets Poland, advertised defensive, could used offensively, even pre-emptively, Russia. Laying rest far-fetched scenario prime motivation Mr Obama's decision, been. However, removing gratuitous irritant bilateral relations, president improved prospects US-Russian arms control negotiations underway Geneva. Those talks could produce December new treaty reducing numbers strategic - is, intercontinental — weapons. If ratified US Senate (which easy, given ferocity partisan wars Washington), US Russia track reductions future. Mr Obama Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, due meet New York week, jointly called eventual goal eliminating nuclear weapons. As successors take steps direction, grapple stark paradox nuclear age: mutual deterrence depends side vulnerable retaliation other. If either side enough defences trump side's offence, mutuality deterrence breaks one sides hair-trigger, making war likely crisis. American statesmen pounded inescapable truth heads initially sceptical Soviet counterparts 40 years ago. The result Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty signed Richard Nixon Leonid Brezhnev 1972. By limiting defensive capability superpowers, ABM treaty necessary companion piece series treaties setting ceilings offensive weaponry. Because nuclear weapons expected us forever, ABM treaty meant last perpetuity. While Soviets converted logic restricting defence, Ronald Reagan not. The late US president championed development space-based comprehensive shield would make offensive weapons — therefore mutual deterrence — "impotent obsolete." Many experts believed Reagan's vision, derisively nicknamed Star Wars, impossible dream. So successor, George H. W. Bush, treated program benign neglect negotiating Russians Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) begun Mr Reagan. The second president Bush reversed father's policy. He greatly weakened START process, pulled US ABM treaty sought revive national missile defence (NMD) system. His decision build interceptor radar sites Poland Czech Republic was, one aides told time, large measure "pouring concrete eventually global NMD." Key officials Obama administration — including president himself, studied arms control college — understand linkage reduction offences regulation defences. However, avoided raising issue context last week's decision. That partly want plan judged merits, vis-à-vis Iranian threat. But enough fights Republicans without energizing right wing trying reinstate principles ABM treaty. Yet sooner later US administration grasp nettle regulating strategic defences. Otherwise, continued reductions strategic nuclear offences either impossible or, worse, dangerous. The author president Brookings Institution.
