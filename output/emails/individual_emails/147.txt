Contrast Benghazi reports West: Here Benghazi since Thursday, I joined representative, Chris Stevens, meetings large number representatives TNC, civil society, UN organizations NG0s, diplomatic corps. While idea trip would correspond significant military advances east start coordinated Tripoli uprising dubbed "Operation Mermaid Dawn," timing gave us opportunity note contrast relative bureaucratic quiet compared hyped-up activity western Libya. Clearly, coordination underway Benghazi west: Ali Tarhouni, recently promoted Deputy Prime Minister In still-to-be-completed cabinet reshufle, previewed Tripoli uprising us, almost minute. Yet one feels that, large extent, TNC officials observers chroniclers rather authors unfolding developments west. (In telling anecdote, confiding us plans Tripoli unfold, Tarhouni turned ringing cell phone, concentrate talking us leisurely manner.) What TNC officials told us large extent sensible mostly reassuring content -- TNC issued directive reiterating policy treat combatants according Geneva conventions observe human rights -- comments fell mostly category passive analysis rather aggressive forward thinking. Washington task forces focused Tripoli; Benghazi While there's sense air final battles begun, palpable anticipation seem translated type stepped-up bureaucratic activity one would expect. After meeting us nearly two hours Thursday, TNC Executive Committee chair (and PM equivalent) Mahmoud Jibril returned Doha rather head kind war room here. I ground far longer Jibril, giving another cameo appearance here. Tarhouni confided plan TNC would relocate quickly Tripoli, Tripoli fall. TNC Chairman Mustafa Abduljalil (who remains accounts unifying figure here) humble, retiring leader, Qadhafi's flamboyance part attraction Libyans make naturally think project INC authority symbolism quickly newly liberated areas. The question Tripoli falls, extensive plans TNC made post Qadhafi transitional structures relevance Tripoli? I want overplay this: flags raised western towns flags used here. Our visit military command center demonstrated active information flow (if exactly command control) passing east west. Tarhouni others visit western towns, usually Tunis, describe support tribal leaders across Libya. No groups claiming established planned alternative civilian authority compete TNC. Still, engagement TNC officials, need remind continually imperative nurture legitimacy authority prevent political vacuum others could fill -- especially Tripoli falls INC here, there. We've talked lot Tripoli whether battle capital could avoided, argued would best solution. One TNC's assets moral distinction Libya TNC aspires promote Qadhafi treated Libya's citizens. The world's attention focus battle Tripoli, cautioned, acts brutality revenge potential internal fights among competing militias blur moral distinction even assassination INC Chief Staff Abdulfatah Younis already did. The damage TNC's credibility could irreparable. We also noted TNC led negotiation succeeds winning Tripoli without fight would underscore TNC leadership far dramatically successful militia assault vaguely connected Benghazi leadership. The TNC officials heard us patiently, clearly mood negotiate. They feel confident current military situation, remain convinced Qadhafi simply give matter high pressure. If anything, positions hardened recent weeks, Abduljalil telling us TNC longer contemplate Qadhafi staying Libya power. Saif Qadhafi seen category father. I believe anything short significant change -- Qadhafi's departure, military U.S. Department State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739732 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

NO FOIA WAIVER. setback punctures TNC's current confidence, NATO insisting pause operations favor negotiations -- persuade TNC leadership interest right offer Qadhafi peaceful way out. Tarhouni also acknowledged trademark candor that, Libyan people right now, negotiations would appear weak satisfactory climax revolution. They point that, despite signs desperation around Qadhafi (e.g., Mohammed Ismail's multiple attempts contact Gene Cretz me), indication Qadhafi prepared throw towel. There real fear that, Qadhafi somehow make Tripoli Sebha, guerilla war could persist years, supplies mercernaries smuggled across Saharan border. Among topics, pushed INC officials hard starting high-profile discussion immediately reconciliation part TNC's platform. We noted many victims Qadhafi's 42-year rule less likely pursue individual acts revenge If assured form address grievances rule-of-law accountability. The message also appeal average Libyans whatever reason remained part Qadhafi's regime end blood hands might otherwise fear retribution. INC officials refer approvingly South African Moroccan models, reiterated commitment inclusive process Libya's future welcomes notorious individuals around Qadhafi. Yet still seem rely largely (variously described) luck, tribal discipline, "gentle character" Libyan people best assurances abuse revenge killings. We continue push this. Benghazi remained full chatter Abdulfatah Younis assassination. With tribal visits investigation committees cabinet changes, INC addressed immediate crisis sufficiently effectively intiial tension gunfire quickly dissipated. But assassination highlighted two realities Libyan life TNC officials previously tried downplay: tribes militias. Rather denying tribal affiliations Libyans, TNC officials looking tribes part solution enforcing discipline preventing type widescale looting pillaging destroyed Benghazi's security infrastructure March. Tribes, heard, also corrective balance Islamist leanings. On reining militias, heard good answers. Some people (Tarhouni, INC National Security Advisor Bazama, civil society representatives) spoke frankly problem, including Islamist leanings powerful. The Islamist militias deserve discussion channels, couple people noted Younis assassination upside making scrutiny issue imperative. Others seemed rely, again, luck tried avert eyes problem militias could post Day After. There widespread disdain Qatar's role encouraging certain militia elements, I able cite lots concern I go Doha later. Qatar's role, too, subject better discussed elsewhere. We also discussed humanitarian financial needs. Tarhouni Jibril noted TNC's financial needs increase territory falls rebel control; worried that, can't provide electricity newly liberated towns fund services there, disenchantment TNC grow. Tarhouni agreed reach Indians discuss Libya's outstanding debts, see help us get India's hold frozen asset proposal lifted. Briefed South Africa's objections, fibril understood need continued outreach Africa (although part South Africa problem may derive Jibril's poor relations Zuma, Jibril telling us recently accused Zuma making Nelson Mandela feel ashamed); Abdulrahman Shalgam go August 25-26 AU Summit Jibril rule attending himself. I've spoken several times UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed since arriving here, UAE finally responded positively soft collateral proposal loan TNC, may fastest way getting funds here, assuming come letter meets UAE's needs passes scrutiny U.S. interagency process. My traveling companions, Bill Roebuck (NEA/MAG director) Ben Fishman NSS, start return trip today. I go Cairo, Doha, Abu Dhabi, where, inter alia, I Libya discussions, including seeing Jibril Doha. With NileSat continuing broadcast Qadhafi's propaganda, Libyan anger Egypt's role approaches exceeds annoyance Qataar. We also checking get Cairo back here, I need join Chris coming days.
