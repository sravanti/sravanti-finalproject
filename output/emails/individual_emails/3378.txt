Mills, Cheryl D <MillsCD@state.gov> Monday, September 14, 2009 10:51 AM H FW: Hitting Bottom Foggy Bottom RELEASE IN FULL FP FortAgn Policy Hitting Bottom Foggy Bottom The State Department suffers low morale, bottlenecks, bureaucratic ineptitude. Do need kill save it? BY MATTHEW ARMSTRONG I SEPTEMBER 11, 2009 Discussion fate Foggy Bottom usually focuses tenure Secretary State Hillary Clinton, troubles public diplomacy, rise special envoys everything European pipelines Afghanistan Pakistan. But Americans would benefit reassessment core functionality U.S. State Department. Years neglect marginalization, well dearth long-term vision strategic planning, left 19th- century institution hamstrung fiefdoms bureaucratic bottlenecks. The Pentagon funds controls wide range foreign-policy diplomatic priorities -- development public diplomacy beyond. The world changed, everyone politicians talking heads terrorists directly influencing global audiences. The pressing issues stateless: pandemics, recession, terrorism, poverty, proliferation, conflict. But report report, investigation investigation, highlighted, State Department broken paralyzed, unable respond new 21st-century paradigm. But get bad? Is possible fix? Or push wall like great Humpty Dumpty reassign pieces? There growing evidence internal machinations State Department corrupted "core missions" traditional diplomacy public diplomacy. This year, example, Government Accountability Office (gao) found department completely failed four-year-old attempt reorganize nonproliferation bureau (a bureau remains leaderless). Besides failing address mission overlap, low morale, lack career opportunities, failed reorganization caused significant drop expertise offices focused proliferation issues -- including "today's threats posted Iran, North Korea, Syria," gao's report said -- coordination bodies like International Atomic Energy Agency. Another report State Department's inspector general year described severe broad dysfunction within Africa bureau, ignoring -- perhaps considering given -- lack departmentwide integration leadership operations. Examples dysfunction range providing public diplomacy personnel computers capable reading interoffice memos failure effectively work new Africa Command. By necessity, Defense Department stepped State Department tuned out: Foggy Bottom relies Pentagon funding even personnel basic operations central mission. For example, Defense Department performs much strategic communications work traditionally purview State Department. In Somalia, example, State Department's budget public diplomacy $30,000. The Pentagon's $600,000. And, State Department's bureaucratic wisdom, $30,000 even belong undersecretary public diplomacy public affairs. Further, rivalries different "cones" -- career tracks, referred one insider "conal caste system" -- State Department severely impact morale, career growth, even operations. The report Africa bureau noted 2002, public affairs public diplomacy "failed office" -- situation worse 2009. Public outreach workers said bureau's leadership "does understand public diplomacy." The sentiment widespread. A 2008 report congressional ombudsman, U.S. Advisory Commission Public Diplomacy, described systemic failure support train public diplomacy officers field, well professional discrimination career track. Attempts fix State Department focused short-term issues, ameliorating shortages human financial resources. The last eight secretaries state attempted bolster department bolstering bottom line. No less Defense Secretary Robert Gates chairman Joint Chiefs Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, long suggested transferring funds Defense Department State Department. But situation dire State Department, point, could even absorb spend much-needed infusion cash. If wholesale transfer funds tomorrow, lack capacity skills State department would mean would give back Defenk Department dole contractors. The creeping militarization U.S. foreign policy deeply worrying, Gates Mullen, also luminaries Secretary Clinton Vice President Joe Biden. In 2008, then-Senator Biden questioned "expanding role military U.S. foreign policy." He said concerned "migration functions authorities U.S. civilian agencies Department Defense." Some commentators even wondered aloud whether best way fix State Department might destroy it. Foggy Bottom could retain small core staff embassies ambassadors. All functions -- public diplomacy, countering misinformation propaganda, development, including provincial reconstruction staffing -- could migrate Pentagon become wholly independent agencies. But atomizing State Department would ultimately prove dangerous militarization foreign policy. The Pentagon needs counterbalance, vertically integrated State Department president, Congress, U.S. public count on. Change, rather creative destruction, Foggy Bottom needs. Envision State Department capable leading whole-of-government initiatives strategic focus instead one hidebound department geared structure tradition execute state-to-state diplomacy. This "Department State Non-State" would deft tackling stateless terrorist networks hurricanes would fostering upholding alliances foreign ministers. To transform Foggy Bottom way require breaking rigid hierarchy, stovepipes, bottlenecks make Pentagon look lean dynamic comparison. Modern global affairs compartmentalized political borders. Besides expanding overly shallow narrow authorities public diplomacy bureau, Clinton must restructure State Department focus less countries regions. Currently, Foggy Bottom's regional bureaus, Near East Affairs, configured oversee patch embassies. Country desk officers, ambassadors, report assistant secretary, regional head. The assistant secretary turn reports undersecretary, reports Clinton. Clinton name regional bureau heads, currently assistant secretaries, undersecretary status. This would help eliminate unnecessary bureaucratic layer would also align State Department Defense Department (which powerful regional commands, Centcom Africom). The State Department's regional leaders would hold equivalent civilian rank four-star combatant commanders like Gen. David Petraeus. These changes would promise improve communications, synchronize missions, put department right path today's requirements. But Clinton beware reforming State Department quickly within -- efforts could paralyzed bureaucracy mutiny would simply wait out. U.S. national security would suffer Pentagon's growing power would become entrenched. Clinton need clear unequivocal support president importantly Congress, authorizes State Department spending bills, chance success. In burst activity Barack Obama's election, Congress authorized money people State Department pushed greater public diplomacy. Still required. The question asked last eight years State Department abrogated various responsibilities -- Defense, who? -- not, indeed cannot, answered department steps plate becomes effective visible leading implementing U.S. foreign policy. This take time. But, saying goes, time like present. The United States Congress supports change, secretaries state defense want change, president whose entire election platform built around word "change," American public would outraged dysfunction knew details. 3
