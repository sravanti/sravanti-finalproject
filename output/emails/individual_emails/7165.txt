Sid US Hikers Were Seized Iraq By Babak Sarfaraz Posted June 24, 2010, Printed October 22, 2010 http://www.theinvestigativefund.org/investigations/internationa1/1338/ KURDISTAN PROVINCE, IRAN— Since arrest last July Iranian forces near Iraq border, three Americans — Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal Sarah Shourd — center high-stakes diplomatic struggle Tehran Washington. Iranian authorities repeatedly accused three entering Iran conduct espionage. Meanwhile, friends family three, along State Department, Committee Protect Journalists, The Nation The Investigative Fund [Bauer written Investigative Fund stories appeared The Nation Mother Jones], rejected spying charge suggested Americans accidentally crossed border recreational hike. Despite well- publicized visit detainees' mothers May, Iran released little information circumstances arrest status case. The Nation The Investigative Fund located two witnesses arrest claim Bauer, Fattal Shourd Iraqi territory arrested — Iran, Iranian officials asserted. Two additional sources report Revolutionary Guards officer likely ordered detention since arrested charges smuggling, kidnapping murder. The witnesses residents Kurdish village Iraq called Zalem, lies miles Iran border; declined identified, fearing retaliation Iranian forces, known conduct missions across border. The witnesses separately reported noticing three Americans hiked mountain scenic Khormal region, straddles border. Part mountain lies Iraq part Iran, except watchtowers occasional signposts, border largely unmarked, although local residents familiar boundaries. The witnesses, followed Western-looking hikers curiosity, say around 2 pm July 31, hikers descended mountain, uniformed guards NAJA, Iran's national police force, waved hikers toward Iranian side using "threatening" "menacing" gestures. When calls ignored, one officer fired round air. As hikers continued hesitate, guards walked yards Iraqi territory, lack jurisdiction, apprehended them. These witness accounts corroborate statement Bauer made May 20 tele-vised reunion Tehran hotel hikers mothers. As New York Times reported, Bauer "denied walked Iran, accused doing, stopping saying, 'We can't really talk that." Farhad Lohoni, local tribal leader, previously claimed American hikers snatched Iraq cross-border raid Iranian agents, reported Daily Telegraph August 2009. Lohoni said relatives seen group men cross border Iraq, told Telegraph hikers "were targeted captured group came Iran, ignoring Iraq's sovereignty. We know means Iran must wanted take Americans hostage sensitive time." A State Department spokesman said unaware evidence three arrested Iraqi territory would comment further. Once captured, Bauer, Fattal Shourd sped car local headquarters Iranian Revolutionary Guards Marivan, town close border province Kurdistan. When arrived, according two sources, Americans remanded custody Lt. Col. Heyva Taab, head Revolutionary Guards' intelligence unit region. According sources — former member Revolutionary Guards official serves provincial government Sanandaj — Taab would authority order Americans' detention eventual transfer Tehran. A branch Iranian military least 125,000 personnel, Revolutionary Guards responsible maintaining national security throughout Islamic Republic. "When I heard news arrested American hikers, I immediately thought, This work intelligence arm Revolutionary Guards, people region," says Idris Ahmedi, Iranian Kurdish exile regional expert visiting scholar Georgetown University. "I thought likely lured Iranian Kurdistan, could arrest them. It consistent Iran's past actions." Less month later, late August 2009, Taab arrested charged July 6 murder son Mostafa Shirzadi, Imam Joma (Friday prayer leader) Marivan, influential cleric region. Shirzadi's nephew also allegedly killed Taab. Since arrest Taab implicated vast criminal enterprise encompassing profitable smuggling operation dozens murders, rapes kidnappings. According Sanandaj official, numerous lawsuits, perhaps hundreds, filed Taab Kurdistan, alleging libel, theft, rape, kidnapping murder. Taab's case twice judge, awaits execution Tehran prison. Although state-run Iranian press reported Taab's crimes, made public series articles January February Kurdish news site, Kurdistan Va Kurdnews, run Kurdistan Democratic Party. A February 17 article describes Taab head "criminal band" reports Taab seven accomplices arrest Revolutionary Guards role vast number illegal killings. Several sources describe Taab central power Kurdistan province. According locals experts, control border lies hands Revolutionary Guards, particular intelligence unit, Etelaat Sepah, whose local division commanded Taab five years. "At point it's really Sepah, Revolutionary Guards, charge, especially western provinces, especially Americans side, Iraq," says Kaveh Ehsani, assistant professor international studies DePaul University Iran expert serves contributing editor journal Middle East Report. "On surface security force [NAJA] charge, really Revolutionary Guards control borders." It region where, according several Iran experts, smuggling cross-border traffic routine. The Iraq-Iran border "relatively porous it's mountainous," says Faraz Sanei, Iran researcher Human Rights Watch, issued report last year political freedom Iranian Kurdistan. Sanei describes border common escape route dissidents —journalists, human rights advocates Iranian Kurds—as well commonly used trade route goods. "Smuggling something taken place continues take place there, whether goods humans across border. It's something happens quite often." Soon Taab took charge Sepah northwestern quadrant Kurdistan, began enrich black-market border economy. According Sanandaj official former Revolutionary Guards officer, firsthand knowledge Taab's activities, Taab's first scheme involved selling merchandise confiscated petty smugglers, known koolbars, traffic consumer goods across border (a trade depicted Iranian film A Time Drunken Horses, won Camera d'Or Cannes 2000). The region also home variety Kurdish nationalist groups demanding autonomy central Tehran government. One these, Party Free Life Kurdistan (PJAK), affiliated Kurdistan Workers' Party, Kurdish separatist organization engages armed conflict within Turkey labeled terrorist organization United States governments. Since 2005 PJAK, based mountains Kurdish Iraq, open conflict Tehran claimed responsibility killing dozens Revolutionary Guards soldiers cross-border raids Iranian military bases, well February 2007 downing Iranian military helicopter shoulder-launched missile Khoy, Western Azerbaijan province, killed thirteen Iranian soldiers. It speculated Kurdish militants enjoy US support. In April 2006, Representative Dennis Kucinich wrote letter President Bush questioning whether US government "fomenting opposition supporting military operations Iran among insurgent groups Iranian ethnic minority groups, operating Iraq." Kucinich named two groups, including PJAK. In November year, Seymour Hersh reported The New Yorker "Israel United States also working together support Kurdish resistance group known Party Free Life Kurdistan," government consultant told Israeli government provided "equipment training" PJAK. The United States Israel denied involvement PJAK. Still, allegations support gained substantial traction inside Iran may undergirded Taab's decision detain Bauer, Fattal Shourd well repeated public charges espionage three. In early April, instance, Iranian Intelligence Minister Heydar Moslehi told Iran's Press TV "it quite obvious us three Americans arrested Iran last year links Western Israeli intelligence services." The Iranian government retaliated rising Kurdish militancy launching counteroffensive PJAK, inside Iran across border Iraq. In August 2007, example, Iranian soldiers crossed Iraq attacked several villages, McClatchy reported. Most recently, June 4, officials Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region alleged "a small unit Iranian soldiers," including tank several vehicles, penetrated mile Iraqi Kurdistan's Arbil province search Kurdish rebels. Until arrest, Taab key player Iran's counter- offensive. The former Revolutionary Guards officer says several current members Guards told Taab's stated goal "completely wipe PJAK" jurisdiction. According Alunedi, scholar Georgetown, Taab involved recent cross-border assassinations Iranian Kurds Iraqi Kurdistan. The Kurdish weekly Awena reported Taab unit assassinated two Kurds December 15, 2008. According former officer Sanandaj official, Taab's criminal enterprise grew beyond smuggling 2007, made first forays murder. Koolbars, petty border smugglers, often killed land mines fatally shot border police. So Taab concocted scheme kidnap koolbars well ordinary unemployed Iranian Kurdish civilians, dress uniforms PJAK insurgents kill them—claiming they'd died military clash—in order collect bounty, high $40,000 head, superiors Revolutionary Guards. He assisted plot least nine others, seven apprehended. The article Kurdistan Va Kurdnews named seven, including Haji Majid Muqimiyan Kermansha, identified ringleader. PJAK officially denied involvement border clashes, including May 3, 2009, post Iranian website Tabnak, published Mohsen Rezai, former head Revolutionary Guards. Many PJAK clashes may, fact, "bogus," said Sanandaj official. "More less clashes PJAK reported area since Heyva Taab gang busted." A mother one koolbar tearfully described son's disappearance. She said went missing day early 2009 government later claimed clash PJAK taken place. The woman, resident border town Iranian Kurdistan, plaintiff one lawsuits Taab; asked name location mentioned, fear would harm case court. Taab's scheme wildly successful, according Sanandaj official, said one bank account Taab's name nearly $6 million deposited since 2008. This macabre scheme ended spring 2009, Taab killed local official's brother seeking work area and, decisively, last July killed cleric's son. On June 11 Mohammad Javad Larijani, secretary general Iran's High Council Human Rights, said government's investigation nearly complete trial Bauer, Fattal Shourd "should far now." In statement issued June 17, mothers hikers called Iran either prosecute release children. "Iran legitimate reason stage release move forward fair trial children openly answer allegations them." "These new revelations, indeed true, show hikers victims political machinations manipulation," said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director International Campaign Human Rights Iran. "The fact held long without prosecution strongly supports trend. Under Iranian laws, committed crime released immediately. Their Iranian lawyer, studied judicial files them, consistently maintained charge illegal entry, subject fine arbitrary detention long. With new information, even charge appears fabricated, basis holding them." As press date, Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal Sarah Shourd detained Iran ten months twenty-three days.
