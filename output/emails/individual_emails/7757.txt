H: Les Gelb, oversaw writing Pentagon Papers, makes points Wikileaks show US today trying solve difficult international problems, telling truth diplomats acting professionally. Wiki Leaks Accidentally Helps U.S. Leslie H. Gelb November 30, 2010 I 10:42pm Julian Assange clearly intended State Dept. cable leaks smear U.S. evil selfish. Leslie H. Gelb inadvertently proved opposite. The Wikileakers dumped vast pile secrets prove United States selfish, stupid wicked—but revelations proved opposite. When remove gossip obvious trivia mesmerized press, clearly see Wikileakers never expected: A United States seriously professionally trying solve dangerous problems frighteningly complicated world, yet lacking power dictate solutions. U.S. policymakers diplomats shown, quite accurately, supposed do: ferreting critical information foreign leaders, searching paths common action, struggling right amount pressure apply allies adversaries. And cases, villain Washington, foreign leaders escaping common action cowardice hypocrisy. Don't think New York minute Julian Assange, Wikileaker, unloaded trove save humankind. Why toss cables Italy's leader rake Germany's chancellor cautious fuddy-duddy, President Hamid Karzai Afghanistan "paranoid"? To save world? Not chance. He get attention, got attention drooling press, went call material highlighting trivial. Did Assange leak critical conversations Chinese Arab leaders help solve problems Korea Iran? Not hair chinny chin chin. He show could it—and attention. Anyone hopeless left-wing ideologue knows leaks crush future serious conversations leaders time come. Just think: told someone serious critical confidence someone else, confidant went told others, would soon repeat mistake? Assange leak cables help solve world problems. These leaks absolutely gratuitous served purpose making media marvel. When actually read cables, here's see: American leaders American diplomats trying solve crucial world In explaining deed publicly, Assange suggests he's uncovering American misdeeds lies. His aim, says, inform citizens democracies peoples around world leaders really doing. Assange also insists transparency's sake. Yet got look inside, didn't see plain: diplomats good job. Indeed, turn nonsense stop listening strange commentary cable news even front pages great newspapers, actually read cables, here's see: American leaders American diplomats trying solve crucial world problems. But turn nonsense stop listening strange commentary cable news even front pages great newspapers, actually read cables, here's see: American leaders American diplomats trying solve crucial world problems. —Washington needs China's help bolstering sanctions Iran, China balks fear jeopardizing oil gas flow country. The Obama team arranges Saudi Arabia guarantee loss supply China. If world wants slow even prevent Iran's march nuclear weaponry, key path so. — The U.S. discovers North Korea manufactured new medium-range missiles trying deliver Iran China. The Obama team discovers this, informs Beijing, asks Beijing stop transfer. Beijing declines. Really creepy. — Yemen's leader takes public responsibility American missile attacks Al Qaeda Yemen. He wants diminish power terrorists, Americans others world. The "lie" Yemeni president harmless way get critical job done—that is, job fighting international terrorism. Wikileaks tears away political cover Yemen's leaders. —No country anywhere near much influence nutty North Korea China. So, U.S. diplomats searching desperately figure Chinese thinking North Korea order compose plan avoiding war Korean Peninsula. So, Wikileakers expose Chinese leaders actually trying give us insight Chinese thinking North Korean craziness. They won't soon. Time again, one actually reads cables, one heartened professionalism insights U.S. diplomats. What doing? They lying, U.S. leaders lying. They actually, believe not, trying solve problems. That seriousness purpose professionalism execute jumps materials. So, naïve say, it's good show effectiveness diplomats. Give break. Ask American diplomat choose looking intelligent leaked cables making progress toward avoiding war. None say leaks, press pursue classified information necessary helpful sensible public debate policy. If U.S. administration lying, distorting facts, telling one story public another itself, means, let's public. If U.S. government concocting intelligence order justify wars, let's hope enterprising reporter finds rest us. But Wikileaks dump providing essential information Americans others—information need serious policy discussion. This massive trashing Wikileaks legitimate effort U.S. government preserve confidentiality least shame most, crime. Leslie H.
