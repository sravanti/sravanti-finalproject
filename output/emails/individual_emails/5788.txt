Published The New Republic (http://www.tnr.com) The Unnecessary Fall A counter-history Obama presidency. • John B. Judis • August 12, 2010 I 12:00 On April 14, 2009, Barack Obama's standing polls beginning slip, Tea Party demonstrators amassing Washington tax day protests, president gave lengthy address atGeorgetown University explaining "five pillars" economic policies. The speech intended promote memorable slogan Obama's program would evoke comparisons Theodore Roosevelt's Square Deal, Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. Obama's contribution New Foundation. "We must lay new foundation growth prosperity—a foundation move us era borrow spend one save invest," declared. Obama would repeat phrase seven times day many occasions next months. At Obama's private White House dinner presidential historians June, historians impressed public New Foundation slogan. "I don't think it's going work," Robert Dallek warned. Doris Kearns Goodwin said sounded "like woman's girdle." One historians might able forewarn Obama slogan unsuccessfully deployed Democratic president before. In 1979 State Union address, Jimmy Carter began, "Tonight, I want examine broad sense state American Union—how building new foundation peaceful prosperous world." Carter would use phrase five times speech, including conclusion, asked members Congress join "in building new foundation." Like Obama's effort, phrase inspired, most, underwear jokes forgotten. Obama's evocation Carter obviously unintended—but Man Plains indeed specter hanging presidency. Of course, Obama already accomplished first 20 months Jimmy Carter entire presidency. But disturbing political resemblance two presidencies. Both men ran inspired campaigns positioned scandals partisan quarrels predecessors initially stirred hopes "transformational" presidency. But, presidents, men somehow failed connect large parts electorate. To sure, number specific reasons Carter Obama landed political trouble. Both men contended rising unemployment—Carter rampant inflation well—and voters' approval president party tend track closely changes economy. Carter faced friction party rise powerful business lobby, Obama dealt Republican Party frustrated dreams post-partisan presidency. Yet important reason difficulties—evident inept attempts brand programs—has inability develop politics resonates public. In United States, politics pivots around allegiance middle class, even identity changed yeoman farmers mechanics store clerks, office workers, x-ray technicians, small business owners. They are, Bill Clinton's words, "those work hard play rules." They central characters populist rhetoric goes back early republic. It depicts middle class embattled threatened either forces (impoverished immigrants, welfare cheaters, ghetto rioters) (Wall Street speculators, state bureaucrats, K Street lobbyists). Populism embraced Glenn Beck Tom Harkin. It intrinsically neither left-wing right-wing. Politicians, Franklin Roosevelt Ronald Reagan, found way using populism's appeal downturns enjoyed success, spurned suffered accordingly. If, circumstances like present one, don't develop populist politics, adversaries use populism define enemy people. That's Carter discovered stagflation late '70s. And that's happened last 20 months Great Recession Barack Obama Democratic Party leads. Obama took office widespread popular support, even among Republicans, first efforts, including $800 billion stimulus, initially enjoyed strong public favor. But wide appeal began dissipate late spring 2009. Disillusion Obama fueled November defeat Democratic gubernatorial candidates New Jersey Virginia. By January 2010, crucial factor Republican Scott Brown's astonishing victory Martha Coakley Massachusetts. In postmortem debate defeats, Democrats blamed Obama's dogged pursuit health care reform economy hemorrhaging jobs. That may factor, real damage done earlier. What doomed Obama politically way dealt financial crisis first six months presidency. In atmosphere primed populist backlash, allowed right wing define terms. As Obama delivering inaugural address, financial crisis already full swing; already apparent financial speculation, outright fraud, irresponsible sometimes illegal housing-loan practices played large role precipitating crisis. The public arms. But, instead rallying public "money changers," Roosevelt done first inaugural, Obama, taking leaf Jimmy Carter's infamous "malaise" speech, put blame public whole. "Our economy badly weakened, consequence greed irresponsibility part some, also collective failure make hard choices prepare nation new age," declared. Over next month, Obama would periodically criticize bankers embarrassing revelations—at various times calling bonuses gave "shameful" "outrage"—but, hearing complaints rhetoric bankers, would back off. At private meeting March 28 13 Wall Street CEOs, president, spokesman Robert Gibbs said, "emphasized Wall Street needs Main Street Main Street needs Wall Street." And, Georgetown speech, Obama returned theme collective responsibility. The recession, Obama said, "was caused perfect storm irresponsibility poor decision-making stretched Wall Street Washington Main Street." Obama's policy followed swerving course rhetoric. One week, would favor harsh restrictions bank insurance-company bonuses, but, next week, would waver; one week, would support legislation allowing bankruptcy judges reduce amount homeowners threatened foreclosure owed banks; next week, would fail protest bank lobbyists pressured Senate kill provisions. But, importantly, Obama—in sharp contrast Roosevelt first months—failed push Congress immediately enact new financial regulations even set commission investigate fraud. (When Congress finally appointed commission July 2009, Obama party put milquetoast Democratic politician, former California State Treasurer Philip Angelides, charge it.) Obama's appointments also conveyed impression wanted let Wall Street hook. He appointed Timothy Geithner treasury secretary. Geithner claimed part Wall Street, but, capacity president Federal Reserve Bank New York, served board directors headed JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. As New York Fed president, Geithner partly responsible decision let Lehman Brothers go under, unpopular tarp program, American International Group (MG) paying back Wall Street creditors government money. Geithner chose chief staff former lobbyist Goldman Sachs. Retiring Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan told me, "Most Americans reading massive compensations bailouts, administration largely hired people culture Wall Street." By spring, Obama's apparent tilt Wall Street sparked right-wing populist revolt country. The newly formed Tea Party movement, Beck Fox News, host right-wing bloggers leading charge; but, less extreme form, general public shared anger. In early April New York Times/CBS News poll, public disapproved Obama's aiding banks 58 percent 33 percent. In poll, public approval Obama's handling economy began fall. Pollsters focus groups also traced disillusionment Obama's economic policies handling financial crisis. Congressman Barney Frank, defends Obama's policies, acknowledges president's political difficulties began revelation MG, received $170 billion government, paid $165 billion bonuses division brought company down. Geithner known bonuses insisted legal grounds block them. (It came Geithner pressured Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd insert provision stimulus bill protected bonuses.) "The pitchforks out. It added injury injury," Frank says. That's public opinion Geithner plummeted. According Rasmussen poll, 24 percent favorable view Geithner 44 percent unfavorable one. The public's view bank bailout AIG bonuses colored view auto bailout, stimulus, health care reform. One rallying cries populist opposition Obama "where's bailout?" (Obama acknowledged "one frequent questions" asked letters.) The auto program became bailout Big Three CEOs; stimulus became bailout government itself; health care reform bailout uninsured—or "reparations," Rush Limbaugh put it. Wrote right-wing blogger Michelle Malkin, "hardworking citizens getting sick played chumps" "moochers, big small, corporate individual, trampling hands demanding endless bailouts." Obama Democrats successfully portrayed aiding "the moochers," "hardworking citizens." In American politics, that's recipe political disaster. Some White House political operation recognized late spring administration's economic efforts defined right-wing populism tried push Obama take populist tack. A group within White House began calling "pitchfork gang," would find attempts convince Obama get tough Wall Street insurance companies undermined Geithner National Economic Council head Larry Summers, worried upsetting business confidence. "There continual tension White House," says person privy discussions. "One week, would hot, then, next week, would dial back." By early January year, Obama clearly losing battle middle class. According CNN poll, 60 percent Americans thought Obama "had paid attention problems faced banks financial institutions" "problems faced middle class Americans." Only 28 percent, barely quarter, thought paid attention middle class. As Brown surged ahead Coakley polls, White House temporarily embraced populist approach. On January 14, Obama called bank bonuses "obscene" said, "we want money back." In January 22 speech Lorain County Community College Elyria, Ohio (a far cry Georgetown), Obama used word "fighting" 13 times "fight" nine times. "I stop fighting you," declared. But, faced falling stock market anger Wall Street, Obama turned conciliatory. On February io, said didn't "begrudge" $17 million bonus awarded Dimon $9 million Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein. "I know guys. They savvy businessmen." Obama's reluctance rail Wall Street might led watered-down financial reform bill, even bill all, but, April 16, Securities Exchange Commission indicted Goldman Sachs fraud. The next week, emboldened Obama went New York criticize bankers directly "failure responsibility." As result indictment Obama's rediscovery anger, Republicans became somewhat less obstructionist, moderate Republicans broke party's leadership, moderate Democrats fell line. Congress produced much stronger bill Democrats ever expected. But Obama's embrace populism remained fitful sporadic. After U.S. Chamber Commerce Verizon's Ivan Seidenberg, head Business Roundtable, criticized Obama anti-business June, president dispatched Geithner, White House aide Valerie Jarrett, Bill Clinton appease business community. Obama said enough anger CEOs, failed convey greater public fighting them. Obama's unwillingness buck Wall Street Business Roundtable, along delayed muddled response BP disaster Gulf, eroded public's confidence leadership. In Pew's midyear report card Obama's image, greatest drop February 2009 June perception Obama "strong leader." Voters sometimes tolerate policies question presidents like John Kennedy Reagan, regard "strong," politicians like Jimmy Carter, regard weak. What factors behind Obama's political difficulties? There doubt that, economy growing faster, unemployment dropping 9 percent, Obama Democrats would popular fearing November rout. But, unfortunately, economy's sluggish recovery cannot completely disentangled White House's weak political performance. In January, White House debated large stimulus propose, Christina Romer, head Council Economic Advisors, proposed $1.2 trillion Keynesian jolt. David Obey, chairman House Budget Committee, told The Fiscal Times Obama's Treasury Department asked initially $1.4 trillion bill. But administration finally proposed stimulus $700 $800 billion included large tax cuts likely stimulate saving consumption—and spending would unlikely produce many jobs end Obama's first term. In stimulus's first year, administration spent $17 billion $139 billion allocated infrastructure spending. Prominent economists, including Paul Krugman Joseph Stiglitz, made case much larger stimulus necessary reverse (rather merely reduce) rise unemployment, that, modest stimulus failed reduce unemployment, Republicans would convince public stimulus toxic medication would block additional Keynesian measures. That argument proven sadly correct. Some White House advisers appear underestimated depth Great Recession. Others seem doubted administration political clout get Congress. But White House might gotten Obama proclaimed national economic emergency (which was); framed issue terms rescuing middle class damage done Wall Street speculators, short-sighted CEOs, Chinese mercantilism; directly attacked Republicans heartless obstructionists. When Obama belatedly made sort case eve financial reform vote year, got much stronger bill anyone anticipated. So it's clear failure get larger stimulus—which ended hurting administration politically—wasn't result political timidity. The president also suffered inability explain public sought large stimulus thought could accomplish. Obama's New Foundation speech Georgetown soon forgotten. Afterward, Obama, dismay Democrats Congress White House aides, pretty much dropped jobs issue. From Labor Day, devoted July visit Buffalo August stopover southern Indiana issue—at time right wing mobilizing him. Obama didn't fail develop consistent narrative economy; didn't really try. Contrast Obama's attempt develop politics justify economic program Reagan 1982. Faced steadily rising unemployment, went 8.6 percent January 10.4 percent November, Reagan political staff, included James Baker, Mike Deaver, Ed Rollins, forged strategy early year calling voters "stay course" blaming current economic troubles Democratic profligacy. "We clearing away economic wreckage dumped laps," Reagan declared. Democrats accused playing "the blame game," strategy, followed letter White House ten months, worked. The Republicans predicted lose many 50 House seats, lost 26 broke even Senate. Some commentators noted Reagan's popularity even lower Obama's. But, key economic questions, much better Obama Democrats currently performing—and voters expressed far greater patience Reagan's program. According polls, even unemployment rate climbed, narrow plurality still expressed confidence Reagan's program would help economy. On eve election, unemployment rate postwar high, New York Times/CBS News poll found 6o percent likely voters thought Reagan's economic program would eventually help country. That's sign successful political operation. If Obama could command numbers, Democrats could seriously limit losses November. But Obama able develop narrative could convince people trust Democrats. Why White House failed convince public fighting effectively behalf? The principal culprit clearly Barack Obama. He strange aversion confrontational politics. His aversion strange schooled it, working community organizer 198os, tutelage activists subscribed teachings radical Saul Alinsky. But, Obama departed Harvard Law School 1988, left Alinsky adversarial tactics behind. The young lawyer returned Chicago won seat Illinois state Senate 1996 practiced different style politics. Obama's principal accomplishments Springfield bills restricting lobbying requiring videotaping confessions potential death penalty cases. He typical blue-collar, bread-and-butter Chicago Democrat, kind good government liberal represents upscale districts city, seeing politics higher calling ill ease (although open opposition to) city's Democratic machine. He also post- racial politician eschewed hard-edged, angry rhetoric Jesse Jackson. (That, too, oddly reminiscent Carter, partly campaigned 1976 white Southern antidote George Wallace's angry racial populism.) Obama carried outlook U.S. Senate, campaign presidency, then, presidency itself. He cerebral, dispassionate, post-partisan; wants "end political strategy based division," "turn page" culture wars 1960s partisan battles 1990s. During campaign, aides jokingly referred "black Jesus." While tolerate even brush aside conflict, reluctant actively foment it. "In time crisis, can't afford govern anger," declared February 2009. During campaign first year office, held blind faith bipartisanship, even Republicans voted bloc legislation. He is, perhaps, ill-suited respects era bruising political warfare. His advisers clearly reinforced inclinations. In campaign, fashioned outsider candidate "hope" "change" extended strategy presidency itself. They see standing party. In meeting congressional leaders last April, senior adviser David Axelrod rejected complaint Obama accorded equal blame Democrats Republicans descriptions "cynical politics Washington." Within White House, top aides still speak promoting Obama "brand." Organizing America, administration's campaign organization, supposed focusing 2010 elections, recently devoted resources organizing parties across country celebrate Obama's forty-ninth birthday. These efforts elevate Obama hurly-burly Washington politics disastrous. Obama's image iconic outsider become screen Fox News, Tea Party, radicalright bloggers, assorted politicians projected image foreigner, Islamic radical, socialist. He remained "the other" aspired campaign, advisers longer control otherness defined. The White House cabinet officials appointed reinforced aversion populism. As Jonathan Alter recounts The Promise: President Obama, Year One, Geithner Summers repeatedly blocked attempts get tough Wall Street grounds would threaten recovery upsetting bankers. For first year, Alter writes, "Obama bought Geithner-Summers argument banks fragile couldn't confronted remained peril." Its reluctance come bankers crippled administration politically, making far difficult get way Congress second stimulus program would boosted recovery Democrats' political prospects. Bad politics trump good policy. Populism profound shortcomings worldview. It tends toward demagoguery. In relentless focus middle class, ignore stigmatize it. It prove hostile long-range scientific outlook. A populist Obama, instance, might postponed battle climate change legislation national health insurance probably would taken weaker stand immigration. But populism indelible part American political psyche, uncomfortable making populist appeals, like Hoover Carter—or, recently, presidential candidate John Kerry—suffer consequences polls. If Obama's politics leads Republican takeover one houses Congress, even Republican president 2012, much Obama accomplished could undone. It's unlikely new Republican president Congress would actually repeal health care financial reform bill. But former could starved public funds deprived regulatory oversight; latter could neutered hostile treasury secretary weak hostile presidential appointees Securities Exchange Commission new Consumer Financial Protection Agency. Reform legislation needs administrations congresses committed reform. That politics come in; that's Obama administration, aversion populism, fallen short. John B.
