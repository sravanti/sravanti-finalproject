Preliminary Analysis Voting Figures Iran's 2009 Presidential Election www.chathamhouse.org.uk 2 Executive Summary Working province province breakdowns 2009 2005 results, released Iranian Ministry Interior, 2006 census published official Statistical Centre Iran, following observations official data debates surrounding made. •In two conservative provinces, Mazandaran Yazd, turnout 100% recorded. •At provincial level, correlation increased turnout swing Ahmadinejad. This challenges notion Ahmadinejad's victory due massive participation previously silent conservative majority. •In third provinces, official results would require Ahmadinejad took former conservative voters, former centrist voters, new voters, also 44% former Reformist voters, despite decade conflict two groups. •In 2005, 2001 1997, conservative candidates, Ahmadinejad particular, markedly unpopular rural areas. That countryside always votes conservative myth. The claim year Ahmadinejad swept board rural provinces flies face trends. Preliminary Analysis Voting Figures Iran's 2009 Presidential Election www.chathamhouse.org.uk 3 1. Irregularities Voter Turnout Two provinces show turnout 100% four show turnout 90%. Regional variations participation disappeared. There correlation increase participation, swing Ahm adinejad. Firstly, across board massive increase turnout, several provinces increasing participation rate nearly 75%. This increase results substantially less variation turnout provinces, standard deviation amongst provincial turnouts falling 23% since 2005. The 2005 results show substantial turnout gap, seven provinces recording turnout 60%, ten 70%. In 2009, two 70% 24 80%. In fact, 21 30 provinces turnouts within 5% 83%. The data seems suggest regional variations participation suddenly disappeared. This makes evident lack sort correlation provinces saw increase turnout saw swing Ahmadinejad (Fig.1) unusual. There significant correlation increase participation given province swing Ahmadinejad (Fig.1). This lack correlation makes argument increase participation previously silent conservative majority won election Ahmadinejad somewhat problematic. Furthermore, concerns numbers themselves. Two provinces, Mazandaran Yazd, results indicate votes cast 12 June eligible voters four provinces turnouts mid-nineties. In country allegations 'tombstone voting' — practice200f using identity documents deceased cast additional ballots — longstanding widespread, result troubling perhaps unexpected. This problem start Ahmadinejad; according official statistics gathered International institute Democracy Electoral Assistance Stockholm, 12.9% registered voters time Mohammed Khatami's 2001 victory citizens voting age. In conclusion, number aspects reported turnout figures problematic. The massive increases 2005, collapse regional variations, absence clear correlation increases turnout increased support candidate make results problematic.

Where Ahmadinejad's New Votes Come From? According official Ministry Interior voting data (see Appendix), Mahmud Ahmadinejad increased conservative vote 113% compared 2005 election. There little correlation provincial level results increase turnout swing President, challenging notion previously silent conservative majority come support him. Interestingly, 1.0 30 provinces, mainly former Mehdi Karrubi strongholds, official data suggests Ahmadinejad received votes former non-voters former Rafsanjani voters, also took 44% vote previously voted Reformist. According official data1, Mahmud Ahmadinejad received approximately 13m votes election combined conservative vote 2005 Presidential election2. Assuming Ahmadinejad retained 11.5m Conservative votes 2005, additional 13m votes could come three sources, descending order likelihood: •The approximately 10.6m citizens vote 2005, chose vote election •The 6.2m citizens voted centrist Rafsanjani 2005 •The 10.4m citizens voted Reformist candidates 2005 In order examine detail Ahmadinejad's increased support came from, table (Fig.3) shows composition 2009 vote province, dividing voted Conservative, Rafsanjani, Reformist 2005, vote 2005. It assumes 2005 voters vote again. The table demonstrates 10 Iran's 30 provinces highlighted red, order official statistics correct Ahmadinejad would needed win new voters, former Rafsanjani voters, also 44% former reformist voters. 1 Serious complaints raised 2005 elections 2009 elections. Government data perfectly reliable. 2 In 2005 three Conservative candidates first round. Ahmadinejad reasonably expected received 2009, votes cast Conservatives 2005. Here, Ahmadinejad's 2009 performance compared combined performance three Conservatives 2005. Preliminary Analysis Voting Figures Iran's 2009 Presidential Election www.chathamhouse.org.uk 6 It notable many provinces Reformist cleric Mehdi Karrubi polled highly 2005, government's figures would appear suggest former supporters voted tactically likely Reformist challenger Mir Hussein Musavi, many expected, rather defected hard-line conservative incumbent Ahmadinejad. This interpretation extent supported relationship percentage former Karrubi voters province, swing Ahmadinejad (Fig.2). To many Reformists, situation extremely unlikely. Mehdi Karrubi well-known reformist, polar opposite views Ahmadinejad issues political cultural freedoms, economic management, foreign policy. They allege fraud, likely provinces Karrubi's vote collapsed provide bulk 600+ complaints defeated c andidates lodging conduct election. However, Karrubi, like Ahmadinejad, seen 'man people', Ahmadinejad much re-incarnation Islamic Republic's early hard left leader current hard-right. Ahmadinejad's supporters thus claim rural voters voted Ahmadinejad 2009 precisely reasons voted Karrubi 2005. The data offers arbitration dispute, although Roukema's application statistical fraud detection techniques 'by district' data turned anomalies respect figures Karrubi's vote,3 may suggest created computer. These followed fully disaggregated 'by polling station' data released ongoing dispute. 3 B Roukena, 'Benford's Law Anomalies 2009 Iranian Presidential Election' (as yet unpublished article, 2009).

Do Rural Voters Support Ahmadinejad? Many commentators suggested, Presidential Election, Ahmadinejad popular rural areas explains high levels support. However, data 2005 Presidential election support contention. Instead, confirms support Ahmadinejad gain 2005 mainly urban suburban areas. The graphs show levels support Ahmadinejad rural population province question (Fig.4) Conservatives group (Fig.5).

This supported fact much Iran's rural population comprised ethnic minorities: Lors, Baluch, • Kurdish, Arab amongst others. These ethnic minorities history voting Reformist voting members ethnic group. For example, important segment Khatami's vote 1997 2001 voted largely Karrubi Mostafa Moin 2005. The 2009 data suggests sudden shift political support precisely rural provinces, previously supported Ahmadinejad conservative (Fig.5) showing substantial swings Ahmadinejad (Fig.6). At time, official data suggests vote Mehdi Karrubi, extremely popular rural, ethnic minority areas 2005, collapsed entirely even home province Lorestan, vote gone 440,247 (55.5%) 2005 44,036 (4.6%) 2009. This paralleled overall swing 50.9% Ahmadinejad, official results suggesting captured support 47.5% cast ballots 4 Cf.
