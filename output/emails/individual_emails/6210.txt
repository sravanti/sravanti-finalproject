Sid US Election And The Fed Welcome To The New (Old) World September 19, 2010 One main debates inside senior Fed offices much may balance much conservative fiscal policy Republicans take over. This important question facing officials sides fence (far squiggles whirls monthly numbers). But it's spending taxes, important are, it's also implementation Reg Reform Health Care Reform. All going change November. Here details. Amid snarkiness crazy Tea Party candidates may (and, know, LOVE snarkiness) two things lost: 1. The President lost control spending tax agenda 2. The President lost control implementing Reg Reform health care legislation Congress pushed through. All polling parties independent sources point strongly Republicans taking House. Although less likely take Senate, able gain effective control spending, taxes large scale administrative reforms. Let's start spending: The basic fact spending approved Congress starts House. As wrote nearly week ago, House Republican Leader Boehner senior staff made clear us would like freeze spending 2008 levels annual cost savings $340 billion. This one top Republican priorities. Freezing spending 2008 levels happen. However, even unlikely event Republicans take House budget -- -- frozen near FY 2010 levels (i.e. last time money formally appropriated). Since spending bills approved fiscal year starts October, Congress pass "continuing resolution" keeps government running specific appropriations made (the 1995 government shutdown happened appropriations continuing resolution...the government literally runs spending authority). Congress pass CR next weeks likely run formation new Congress (say February March) next year. They could lame duck session, would cutting close cute. Because new Congress - even Republicans fail take full control House - dominated fiscal conservatives, Boehner's CR idea traction. The Senate make moderate, President veto thus shut government sign take hit. In turn two things: (1) frees money Bush tax rollovers (2) helps plan slow freeze implementation reg reform health care reform bills. The first part obvious. The second may less so. People forget implementation rules requires staff increases, staff reg writing, etc that's money. By freezing spending previous levels freeze ability hire new staff seriously obstruct new rule writing process. Add Boehner's commitment overturn two major regulatory reforms you've got tidal wave indecision paralysis (Jesus, talk mixed metaphors although would interesting see one those). The hearings announce simply chilling effect threatening overturn laws accomplish ninety-percent wants get done, potentially give courts time strike parts health care bill appeal. THE SENATE While everyone written Republican control Senate (we haven't), attention Senate look like even consensus 52-54 Democratic majority prevails. The point US Senate function January 2011 given new membership. We got glimpse would look like moderate Republican Scott Brown elected health care public option panned Reg Reform trimmed around edges. The incoming crop members much ardent government spending, debt, taxes regulatory oversight. They make Boehner's job much easier Take quick look new members (and several marry sworn office). While candidates replacing Republican open seats, generally considered conservative predecessors: 1. ck (CO) - likely winner 2. Toomey (PA) - likely winner 3. Rubio (FL) - likely winner 4. Ayotte (NH) - likely winner 5. Blunt (MO) - likely winner 6. Portman (OH) -likely winner 7. Coats (IN) - likely winner 8. Paul (KY) - likely winner 9. Miller (AK) - likely winner 10. Lee (UT) - likely winner 11. Boozman (AR) - likely winner 12. Hoeven (ND) - likely winner 13. Kirk (IL) - 50/50 (lean GOP) 14. Angle (NV) - 50/50 tossup There several Democrat-controlled seats remain play (CA, WI, WA, CT). These races continue develop report picture Election Day becomes clearer. These likely new members join following traditional budget trouble-makers US Senate: 1. DeMint (SC) 2. Coburn (OK) 3. Inhofe (OK) 4. McConnell (KY) 5. Kyl (AZ) 6. McCain (AZ) 7. Thune (SD) 8. Crapo (ID) 9. Vitter (LA) 10. Burr (NC) One aggressive Senator slow body snail's pace, Republicans operated efficiently minority party 41 votes total. In January, least 22 new existing serious road blocks patrolling Senate Floor. The Republican pick-ups make getting 60 votes cloture impossible spending bills. Welcome new reality.
