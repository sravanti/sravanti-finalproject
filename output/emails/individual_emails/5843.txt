Congratulations resumption direct talks. As evidenced activity past several weeks involvement peace process inevitably deepened need high-level U.S. intervention grown. I believe positive result. But fundamental issue remains role going forward order maximize chances diplomatic success. I. . State Play As U.S. embarks next stage Israeli-Palestinian process, faces series tactical strategic challenges regarding policy, politics personality. 1. At policy level, meager results indirect talks difficulties transitioning direct talks underscored lack trust two sides well existing substantive gaps. With direct talks begin coming days, one obstacles removed, several remain. Some may resolved connection gaining agreement direct talks. a. How handle renewal non-renewal Israel's settlement moratorium? b. What goal direct talks consensus matter parties? A comprehensive agreement permanent (CAPS) covers details? A framework agreement permanent status (FAPS) outlines governing parameters, along lines 2000 Clinton parameters? Or, less ambitiously, short (one two page) statement principles? c. What role U.S. play? Will George another U.S. official present meetings? Will Netanyahu accept that? Is argument allowing two sides deal one another without intermediary, least while, seek play U.S.? d. What U.S. event impasse breakdown? Should present bridging proposals and, so, when? e. How much work done, parallel simultaneously direct talks, U.S. Palestinians one hand U.S. Israel other? Beyond questions, I persuaded important factor likely remain Netanyahu prepared do. You witnessed first-hand difficult deal Palestinians Arab world generally; fragile Abbas's political position; indecisive be. Still, bottom, relatively clear sense positions core issues ever reach moment truth. That case Netanyahu either know prepared share who, now, neither felt urgency reach deal discomfort status quo. Assuming Bibi convinced benefits deal along lines acceptable Palestinians, occur solely basis talks Abbas, likes truly respect fears position deliver. Rather, happen feels (1) leadership U.S. administration genuinely trusts; (2) convinced combination agreement U.S. assurances meets core needs terms Israeli security international recognition Jewish character; (3) feels that, U.S. help, sell people survive -- even thrive -- politically. Getting Bibi accept core compromises enough, course. Other basic elements strategy must involve reaching effectively Israeli public ensuring strong, vocal Arab support U.S.- sponsored deal without Abbas cannot say yes Israelis lack incentive so. But point prerequisite successful peace effort U.S. convince prime minister -- various forms overt persuasion implicit pressure -- make necessary compromises. At end day, Bibi make deal, deal U.S. much Palestinians. 2. At political level, past year clearly demonstrated degree U.S. hamstrung low ratings Israel among important segments domestic Jewish constituency. This critical dimension electoral reasons, U.S.'s best chance influencing Bibi build support deal Israel home among care most. That capacity improved extent result successful July visit Netanyahu string military/security deals two countries. But must honest: sill long way go. If anything, recent Obama/Bibi illustrated new, potentially perverse dynamic: U.S. president juncture needs Israeli prime minister validate pro-Israeli credentials Israeli prime minister needs U.S. president vouch pro-peace ones. 3. At level personalities, George, skill perseverance, cannot secure serious concessions parties himself. In recent discussions, Israelis Palestinians described someone respected would make major concessions. This curse day-to-day negotiator. When ready deal, deal players perceive authority. It different Dennis Clinton Administration. This mean Mitchell crucial role going forward. Indeed, empowered active involvement. The president faces different less difficult problem. He trusted Israel and, though July meeting might altered situation somewhat, trusted Bibi. Domestically, faces reservoir skepticism issue reflects many factors, including inexcusable prejudice, could obstruct effectiveness interlocutor salesman. Besides, learned WJC's presidency, would mistake Obama get deeply invested negotiations prior end-point; time expend political capital prematurely. To so, moreover, would automatically devalue role anyone beneath him, thus making peace process whole excessively dependent involvement. Your Role Under circumstances, view, deeper involvement essential potentially highly beneficial. It selective involvement; Mitchell still must day-to-day negotiator others also must play part. In particular, I would recommend get overly mired details direct talks set questions I described (about format, goal, U.S. role, etc) critical junctures. Nor would I advise get pulled Christopher-style shuttle diplomacy would quickly depreciate value. Rather, injecting strategically right time right way, could fill gaps identified above. This uniquely placed address need higher-level mediator someone enjoys considerable credibility Israel U.S. (Bibi reportedly told someone recently prepared deal substantively Obama you). Your role would twofold 1. To serve higher-level interlocutor matters offinal status. To large degree, Abbas's positions already known; explored pushed, engage him. But probably know zone possible agreement. Not Bibi and, I believe, ideally suited begin series in-depth conversations aimed understanding key concerns, met, would need us others, far, end day, prepared go Palestinians security needs met. Bibi knows trusts you; fact, almost certainly high-level U.S. official trusts most. If succeed taking confidence work time, could pave way Israeli-U.S. understanding would underpin Israeli-Palestinian agreement. At times, require tough pushing back extreme demands (the militarily questionable request long term Israeli presence Jordan Valley one them) proposing rational alternatives. But point without getting Bibi trust level us, without feeling lose also gain, process unlikely go anywhere. To repeat, Mitchell's expense. It parallel, reinforcing process would deal one-on-one Abbas Netanyahu periodic intervals, extensive periods time. 2. To help restore US. 's image credibility Israel among important domestic constituencies. You history, background credentials Israel thus overcome suspicion Obama must contend. Over time, series visits public statements, would seek make case peace agreement positive terms, focusing benefits would bring Israelis rather costs would incur: secure recognized borders; stronger security ties U.S. others; end conflict; normal relations Arab world; strengthened international legitimacy. III. Potential Downsides Responses 1. Dragging weeds negotiations. A risk exists that, though repeated meetings Bibi Abbas, drawn detailed discussions nature territorial compromise, precise security arrangements, etc. This would unhelpful process you. There fine line discussing principles guide final outcome precise details outcome, important cross it. Your role extract Bibi important understandings parameters (e.g., security arrangements Jordan valley minimize infringements Palestinian sovereignty minimize duration residual Israeli presence) respective negotiators work details 2. Disempowering George. A related danger render George powerless creating sense everything dealt you. Besides potentially leading step down, outcome would serve interests reasons cited, effectiveness function remaining somewhat removed day-to-day specifics talks. In fact, I see it, process could end strengthening George's presently hand clarifying it. Once Bibi reached agreement broad principles, two provide instructions respective negotiators find solutions reflect them. In sense, George counterpart stronger clearer mandate currently case. 3. Involving failed enterprise. Of potential downsides, significant one ought dismissed lightly. Failure real possibility. Palestinians disarray. The Arab world profoundly divided, forthcoming successions Egypt Saudi Arabia weaken two states upon rely. And serious questionmark hovers Bibi's politics, head heart. As result, powerful argument could made would better keeping arms' length process, especially given much else plate. That said, I disagree following reasons: a. By getting involved, risk worst two worlds: associated failure (which, virtue position, inevitably would be) criticized engaged effort avert it. b. Over past year half, involved -- traveling region; seeking convince Abbas enter talks; commenting settlement freeze Jerusalem -- able escape kind involvement future. The problem engagement appeared sporadic rather strategic -- you've deployed deemed necessary get impasse rather order implement long term, well thought-out plan. I think served well. c. While one cannot means confident success, I believe agreement possible chance work effectively bring Bibi position believes costs historical compromise outweighed benefits. d. If don't try next year year half, likelihood forced deal extensively Middle East -- albeit peacemaking crisis-managing mode. Without movement peace process, Abbas could depart, Fayyad's state-building plan could gone smoke, hostilities might break Israel, Syria Hizbollah U.S. would deal Iran even less hospitable regional climate.
