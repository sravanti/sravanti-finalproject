Sid http://www.newstatesman.com/asia/2010/08/india-pakistan-afghanistan iNT aLOSE The military mullahs William Dalrymple Published 23 August 2010 The Pakistani state long history nurturing jihadis means dominating Afghanistan undermining India. It proving fatal alliance. It May nightmarish year Pakistan pretty good one country's inscrutable chief army staff, powerful man Land Pure, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. For start, army's response floods compared well usual corrupt incompetence Pakistan's civilian politicians, guided chateau-hopping president, Asif Ali Zardari (while minister investment, nicknamed "Mr 10 Per Cent"; upgraded "Mr 110 Per Cent"). This led discussion army circles whether time drop civilian fig leaf return country loving embrace military. So serious threat, one country's senior well-connected journalists. Najam Sethi, editor-in-chief Friday Times, went record month warn elements army plotting yet another coup."( know definitely discussed," said. Then news Kayani going allowed keep job second term: "an extraordinary situation requires extraordinary decision overcome it", explained brigadier, writing Nation newspaper. Kayani, former head Pakistan's notorious intelligence agency, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISO, continue run army, default Pakistan's foreign policy, November 2013. But Kayani's biggest triumph year, arguably greatest career, visit Kabul July honoured guest Afghan president, Hamid Karzai. The visit marked important thawing Pak-Afghan relations, glacial ever since Karzai came power 2001. It also coincided sacking Amrullah Saleh, Karzai's pro-Indian rabidly anti-ISI former security chief. Saleh tough Tajik rose prominence mujahedin protege Ahmed Shah Massoud, Indian-backed "Lion Panjshir". The Taliban, sponsors ISI, regarded Saleh fiercest opponent, something Saleh enormously proud of. When I dinner Kabul May, spoke length frustration ineffectiveness Karzai's government taking fight Taliban, extent ISI managing aid, arm train puppet insurgents North Waziristan Balochistan. Saleh's sacking gave notice important change direction Karzai. As Bruce Riedel, Barack Obama's Af-Pak adviser, said news broke, "it means Karzai already planning post-American Afghanistan". • It seems Kayani Karzai discussing sort accommodation Afghan government ISI- sponsored elements Taliban, maybe Sirajuddin Haqqani, could give much Pashtun south pro-Pakistan Taliban, preserve Karzai power Kabul US withdrawal. The expulsion India, Pakistan's great regional rival, Afghanistan, least closing four regional consulates, would top priority ISI return deal kept Karzai power. With US toppling Taliban 11 September 2001 attacks, Pakistan's influence disappeared abruptly Afghanistan India quickly filled vacuum. To ISI's horror, early years decade, India provided reconstruction assistance training worth roughly £835m total. It also built roads, sanitation projects, new Afghan parliament free medical facilities across country. It even offered help train Afghan army. Nato refused. As General Stanley McChrystal put report last year, "while Indian activities largely benefit Afghan people, increasing Indian influence Afghanistan likely exacerbate regional tensions encourage Pakistani countermeasures". McChrystal right. The Pakistanis always paranoid small Indian presence Afghanistan. "We strong evidence [that India is] using Afghanistan Pakistan's interests destabilise Pakistan," foreign ministry spokesman claimed March. Pakistan's military establishment, terrified economic superpower emerging south, believes would suicide accept Indian presence regards Afghan backyard - potential point retreat army event Indian invasion, something Pakistani analysts refer vital "strategic depth". According Indian diplomatic sources, still fewer 3,600 Indians Afghanistan; ten Indian diplomatic officers, opposed nearly 150 UK embassy. Yet horror encircled led ISI risk Pakistan's relationship main strategic ally, US, order keep Taliban play leadership ISI patronage Quetta - policy Kayani developed head IS!. Karzai's new deal Pakistanis, clear intention try reach accommodation proxies among Taliban, therefore represents major strategic victory Kayani Pakistan's military, well grave diplomatic defeat India. Pakistan's support Taliban today recent chapter old story complicity jihadi movements Pakistani state. Since days anti-Soviet mujahedin, Pakistan's army saw violent Islamic groups ingenious cost-effective means dominating Afghanistan (which finally achieved retreat Soviets 1987) bogging Hindu-dominated Indian army Kashmir (which managed great effect 1990 onwards). The former ISI director Dick Dastardly lookalike Hamid Gul, largely responsible developing strategy, said me: "If jihadis go contain India, tying one rnillion men army soil, legitimate cause, support them?" Next Gul Islamabad living room lay piece Berlin Wall presented city's people "delivering first blow" Soviet empire use jihadis 1980s. The WikiLeaks documents suggest still busy liaising jihadis "retirement". The Pakistani military top brass long convinced could control militants nurtured. In taped conversation President Pervez Musharraf Muhammad Aziz Khan, chief general staff, India released 1999, Aziz said army jihadis "tooti" (balls). Yet Islamists increasingly followed agendas, sending suicide bombers Pakistan's religious minorities political leaders, even IS! headquarters. Nonetheless, many army still believe jihadis practical defence Indian hegemony nuclear weapons. For them, supporting Islamist groups ideological religious whim, much practical patriotic imperative - vital survival strategy Pakistani state. The army ISI continued duplicitous risky policy 11 September 2001 despite Musharrafs public promises contrary. The speed US lost interest Afghanistan invasion embarked plans invade Iraq convinced Pakistani army Washington long-term commitment Karzai's regime. This led generals keeping Taliban reserve, used reinstal pro-Pakistani regime Kabul American gaze turned elsewhere. So .ISI gave refuge leadership Taliban fled Afghanistan 2001. Mullah Mohammed Omar kept IS! safehouse Quetta; militia lodged sprawling suburb Pashtunabad. There, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar presided Taliban military committee war chest. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, leader Hizb-e-lslami, lured back exile Iran allowed operate freely outside Peshawar, Jalaluddin Haqqani, one violent Taliban commanders, given sanctuary North Waziristan. Other groups despatched safehouses Balochistan. By 2004, US filmed Pakistani army trucks delivering Taliban fighters Afghan border recovering days later; wireless monitoring US base Bagram picked Taliban commanders arranging Pakistani army officers border safe passage came Afghanistan. Western intelligence agencies concluded ISI running full training programme Afghan Taliban, turning blind eye raised funds Gulf allowing import materiel, mainly via Dubai. By 2005 Taliban, covert Pakistani support, launching full-scale assault Nato troops Afghanistan given covering fire returned bases Pakistan. At time, Taliban attacks Indian interests Afghanistan intensified, beginning process turning Afghan conflict, like Kashmir, today: lndo-Pak proxy war. The Indian embassy Kabul twice bombed - July 2008 October 2009 - two city-centre hotels thought used Research Analysis Wing (Raw), Indian intelligence agency. Seven Indian civilians two Indian military officers died blasts. The degree ISI controlling Afghan Taliban become clear, documents published WikiLeaks. A report Matt Waldman Carr Centre Human Rights Harvard, based interviews ten former senior Taliban commanders, closely documents IS! "orchestrates, sustains strongly influences" Taliban shows !SI even represented Taliban's supreme leadership council, Quetta Shura. Meanwhile, Punjab, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, founder Lashkar-e-Toiba, man believed behind 2008 Bombay attacks, allowed continue operating Muridke, near Lahore. "The powerful western world terrorising Muslims," told conference Islamabad year. "We invaded, manipulated looted. We must fight evil trio America, Israel India. Suicide missions accordance Islam. In fact, suicide attack best form jihad." At time Pursuing policy selectively using jihadis, Pakistan appeased US giving generous assistance CIA arresting foreign Arab al-Qaeda personnel. A major assault also launched militants took Lal Masjid ultra-radical Pakistan Taliban took Swat Valley announced intention turning country Islamic Emirate. In course operations others Federally Administered Tribal Areas, 1,500 Pakistani soldiers policemen killed; another 250,000 people made homeless Pak army assault Bajaur. The IS1 even prepared arrest members Afghan Taliban didn't follow orders. Hence seizure Karachi, February, Taliban second-in- command, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, along aboutia dozen senior Taliban ISI regarded infringing hospitality opening talks Karzai administration via Saudis, without ISI clearance. Yet, even though Pakistani army conducted major offensives six tribal areas, seventh, North Waziristan, left alone, home ISI's favourite proxies: Haqqani Hekmatyar. Similarly, Pakistan's foot-dragging response 2008 attacks Bombay, lack response attacks minority faith groups Pakistan past months, show Janus-faced policy remains place. This summer, chief minister Punjab, Shahbaz Sharif, quoted heatedly denying militant groups working Pakistani Punjab, Punjabi Taliban even existed. There still, eyes many Pakistani establishment, good Taliban bad Taliban, useful militants expendable ones. In eyes, ongoing defeat Nato Afghanistan, US British troops suffering record casualties last month, vindication long-term strategy. Islamabad succeeded regaining influence Afghanistan Delhi checked. But India take lying down. Already Indian press reported attempts - resuscitate Northern Alliance contingency Taliban's takeover south, India working conjuction Russia, Iran central Asian "stans". The Indian national security adviser, Shivshankar Menon, despatched Afghanistan March, foreign minister, S M Krishna, visited Tehran. Post-American Afghanistan looking increasingly likely divided Tajik, Uzbek Hazara north Pashtun south, either formally, partition, likely, slip inter-ethnic civil war, India supporting arming north Pakistan south. As diplomacy gathers pace, Afghan Taliban, already control 70 per cent country. continue increase power. The worrying development spread Taliban units previously peaceful north, taken pockets Pathan settlement around Kunduz Badakhshan. The death British aid worker Karen Woo 5 August direct result. In Pakistan. too, jihadi activity growing. Last year 87 suicide attacks across country, killing roughly 3,000 people ISI week stated that, first time nation's history, regarded home-grown Islamic militants bigger threat integrity nation India. Yet army continues obsess India. In recent speech, Kayani emphasised although army knows dangers militancy, Indian attacks principally focused. At time Pakistan's economy crisis, electricity supply increasingly erratic educational system complete breakdown, Kayani secured huge increase country's defence budget. It pretty picture: growing violence everywhere, increasing Indo-Pak tensions defeat western interests region. Worst all, Pakistani army regards major triumph, unlikely change policy time soon.
