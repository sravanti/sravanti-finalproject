Dean Baker co-director Center Economic Policy Research Washington, DC. Wednesday, 18 August 2010 04:04 Thomas Friedman begins oiece 1Q(44v telling readers that: "over past weeks I've chance speak senior economic policy makers America Germany." This might lead readers believe share great insights would possible someone special access senior economic policy makers. Readers expectation seriously disappointed. There nothing insightful found Washington Post's editorial pages average workday. Friedman rehashes usual cliches, usual lack thought. In so, gets story recent past present seriously wrong. Starting past, badly misrepresents prior business cycle: "we've ended decade debt-fueled growth borrowed money China give tax cut entitlements nothing curtail spending make long-term investments new growth engines." The main problem facing U.S. economy last decade lack demand. This large part due fact China lent us. China's lending policy propping value dollar order maintain export market United States. (At start decade, Clinton administration also tried promote over-valued dollar.) The over-valued -U.S. dollar made imports China countries cheap United States made exports expensive countries. This led large growing trade deficit business cycle. The trade deficit replaced domestic demand, preventing economy approaching normal levels employment (even boost housing bubble) crash. There reason whatsoever believe China's decision prop dollar way affected Bush tax cuts. In words, neither Bush tax cuts growth entitlements anything borrowing China. The issue China's decision lend thereby prop dollar. Given weakness demand decade, expenses could easily filled domestic production without borrowing abroad. Friedman better shifts discussion past present. He refers businesses' reluctance hire result "unusual uncertainty," phrase attributed Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bemanke. Of course reluctance hire, simply lack demand labor. A reluctance hire would reflected increasing number hours per worker, employers sought meet demand labor working existing workforce hours. This happening. There modest uptick hours low point downturn, increase hours per worker certainly rapid recessions average workweek still far shorter every sector downturn. Later tells readers: "America's solvency inflection point coinciding technological one. Thanks Internet diffusion, rise cloud computing, social networking shift laptops desktops hand-held iPads iF'hones, technology destroying older, less skilled jobs paid decent wage faster pace ever spinning new skilled jobs pay decent wage require education ever." This great story -- social networking soaring, IPads everywhere -- Friedman evidence whatsoever development increased demand educated workers reduced demand less educated workers? If so, would place column present evidence. Otherwise, readers might think 4.7 percent unemployment rate college grads (nearly triple pre-recession level), coupled decline real wages decade, implies reduced demand labor highly educated workers well less educated workers. Friedman's proposed fix also seems bit wide mark. He insists: "There one way deal challenge: innovation stimulate new industries jobs pay workers $40 hour, coupled huge initiative train Americans win jobs global competitors. There way." We better hope another way. A wage $40 hour would put worker well 90th percentile wage distribution. Even double number jobs pay range -- incredible accomplishment -- happens 80 percent workforce? Friedman warns us challenge Europe getting Germany's past present wrong: "Keeping Germany won't easy. A decade ago Germany 'sick man Europe.' No more. The Germans pulled together. Labor gave wage hikes allowed businesses improve competitiveness worker flexibility, government subsidized firms keep skilled workers job downturn." Germany clearly done sorne changes benefited economy, like work sharing, haven't, past "sick man Europe" invention Friedman highly placed sources. Germany always ran trade surplus. That basic measure country's competitiveness: foreigners buying goods. Germany's unemployment rate 2.000 ayeravd 7 .,5_percept, hugely different current 7.0 percent rate. The story Friedman seems completely missed basics current economic crisis spite weeks conversing senior economic policy makers. The current crisis due lack demand pure simple. If generate demand either expansionary Fed monetary policy, greater fiscal stimulus, increased exports due falling dollar, reason believe economy return high levels employment. Certainly Friedman presented evidence increased demand generate increased employment always has. The longer term debt problem overwhelmingly health care story. Apparently Mr. Friedman's sources don't access documents like Medicare trustees report, imply U.S. health care costs controlled serious long-term deficit problem. This may prove -Wrong, seems would least worth noting column. Of course, fixed health care system, always achieve huge saving retyinq efficient health care systems countries. If Friedman's intention scare us, succeeded. After all, senior economic policy makers U.S. Germany badly misinformed Friedman implies, expect times ahead.
