I'm usually pessimist, I'm sure dire seems moment 10,000 miles away. First, world/media fixated President's speech, imagery Riyadh dominates, there's Honduras footage interest, key. Speech tomorrow blanket coverage extinguish Cuba stuff, need weather night. Second, Tom & Dan record conf call long ago think well. Dan especially strong, he's also speaking people 1:1 Third, statement strong reporting catch it, it's 90 minutes. Fourth, suffering two significant tactical problems: 1) removed 2) press corps position today flight, people worked week ones likely skew way replaced reporters connected us. The two issues rectified tomorrow two interviews - especially Greta malleable. We use make strong case principle, simple fact Cuba wasn't OAS yesterday, won't tomorrow. Everyday passes reinforces point. The time difference East Coast help us moving whatever said interviews tomorrow. Short term, started week showing engage Cuba (mail, migration), ending showing serious redlines Long term, stood human rights plus.
