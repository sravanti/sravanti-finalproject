The Runaway General Stanley McChrystal, Obama's top commander Afghanistan, seized control war never taking eye real enemy: The wimps White House By Michael Hastings Jun 22, 2010 10:00 AM EDT This article originally appeared RS 1108/1109 July 8-22, 2010. 'Howed I get screwed going dinner?" demands Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It's Thursday night mid-April, commander U.S. NATO forces Afghanistan sitting four-star suite HOtel Westminster Paris. He's France sell new war strategy NATO allies — keep fiction, essence, actually allies. Since McChrystal took year ago, Afghan war become exclusive property United States. Opposition war already toppled Dutch government, forced resignation Germany's president sparked Canada Netherlands announce withdrawal 4,500 troops. McChrystal Paris keep French, lost 40 soldiers Afghanistan, going wobbly him. "The dinner comes position, sir," says chief staff, Col. Charlie Flynn. McChrystal turns sharply chair. "Hey, Charlie," asks, "does come position?" McChrystal gives middle finger. The general stands looks around suite traveling staff 10 converted full-scale operations center. The tables crowded silver Panasonic Toughbooks, blue cables crisscross hotel's thick carpet, hooked satellite dishes provide encrypted phone e-mail communications. Dressed off-the-rack civilian casual — blue tie, button-down shirt, dress slacks — McChrystal way comfort zone. Paris, one advisers says, "most anti-McChrystal city imagine." The general hates fancy restaurants, rejecting place candles tables "Gucci." He prefers Bud Light Lime (his favorite beer) Bordeaux, Talladega Nights (his favorite movie) Jean-Luc Godard. Besides, public eye never place McChrystal felt comfortable: Before President Obama put charge war Afghanistan, spent five years running Pentagon's secretive black ops. "What's update Kandahar bombing?" McChrystal asks Flynn. The city rocked two massive car bombs past day alone, calling question general's assurances wrest Taliban. "We two KIAs, hasn't confirmed," Flynn says. McChrystal takes final look around suite. At 55, gaunt lean, unlike older version Christian Bale Rescue Dawn. His slate-blue eyes unsettling ability drill lock you. If you've fucked disappointed him, destroy soul without need raise voice. "I'd rather ass kicked roomful people go dinner," McChrystal says. He pauses beat. "Unfortunately," adds, "no one room could it." With that, he's door. "Who's going dinner with?" I ask one aides. "Some French minister," aide tells me. "It's fucking gay." The next morning, McChrystal team gather prepare speech giving Ecole Militaire, French military academy. The general prides sharper ballsier anyone else, brashness comes price: Although McChrystal charge war year, short time managed piss almost everyone stake conflict. Last fall, question-and-answer session following speech gave London, McChrystal dismissed counterterrorism strategy advocated Vice President Joe Biden "shortsighted," saying would lead state "Chaos-istan." The remarks earned smackdown president himself, summoned general terse private meeting aboard Air Force One. The message McChrystal seemed clear: Shut fuck up, keep lower profile Now, flipping printout cards speech Paris, McChrystal wonders aloud Biden question might get today, respond. "I never know what's going pop I'm there, that's problem," says. Then, unable help themselves, staff imagine general dismissing vice president good one- liner. "Are asking Vice President Biden?" McChrystal says laugh. "Who's that?" "Biden?" suggests top adviser. "Did say: Bite Me?" When Barack Obama entered Oval Office, immediately set deliver important campaign promise foreign policy: refocus war Afghanistan led us invade first place. "I want American people understand," announced March 2009. "We clear focused goal: disrupt, dismantle defeat Al Qaeda Pakistan Afghanistan." He ordered another 21,000 troops Kabul, largest increase since war began 2001. Taking advice Pentagon Joint Chiefs Staff, also fired Gen. David McKiernan — U.S. NATO commander Afghanistan — replaced man didn't know met briefly: Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It first time top general relieved duty wartime 50 years, since Harry Truman fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur height Korean War. Even though voted Obama, McChrystal new commander chief failed outset connect. The general first encountered Obama week took office, president met dozen senior military officials room Pentagon known Tank. According sources familiar meeting, McChrystal thought Obama looked "uncomfortable intimidated" roomful military brass. Their first one-on-one meeting took place Oval Office four months later, McChrystal got Afghanistan job, didn't go much better. "It 10-minute photo op," says adviser McChrystal. "Obama clearly didn't know anything him, was. Here's guy who's going run fucking war, didn't seem engaged. The Boss pretty disappointed." From start, McChrystal determined place personal stamp Afghanistan, use laboratory controversial military strategy known counterinsurgency. COIN, theory known, new gospel Pentagon brass, doctrine attempts square military's preference high-tech violence demands fighting protracted wars failed states. COIN calls sending huge numbers ground troops destroy enemy, live among civilian population slowly rebuild, build scratch, another nation's government — process even staunchest advocates admit requires years, decades, achieve. The theory essentially rebrands military, expanding authority (and funding) encompass diplomatic political sides warfare: Think Green Berets armed Peace Corps. In 2006, Gen. David Petraeus beta-tested theory "surge" Iraq, quickly gained hardcore following think-tankers, journalists, military officers civilian officials. Nicknamed "COINdinistas" cultish zeal, influential cadre believed doctrine would perfect solution Afghanistan. All needed general enough charisma political savvy implement it. As McChrystal leaned Obama ramp war, fearlessness used track terrorists Iraq: Figure enemy operates, faster ruthless everybody else, take fuckers out. After arriving Afghanistan last June, general conducted policy review, ordered Defense Secretary Robert Gates. The now-infamous report leaked press, conclusion dire: If didn't send another 40,000 troops — swelling number U.S. forces Afghanistan nearly half — danger "mission failure." The White House furious. McChrystal, felt, trying bully Obama, opening charges weak national security unless general wanted. It Obama versus Pentagon, Pentagon determined kick president's ass. Last fall, top general calling troops, Obama launched three-month review re-evaluate strategy Afghanistan. "I found time painful," McChrystal tells one several lengthy interviews. "I selling unsellable position." For general, crash course Beltway politics — battle pitted experienced Washington insiders like Vice President Biden, argued prolonged counterinsurgency campaign Afghanistan would plunge America military quagmire without weakening international terrorist networks. "The entire COIN strategy fraud perpetuated American people," says Douglas Macgregor, retired colonel leading critic counterinsurgency attended West Point McChrystal. "The idea going spend trillion dollars reshape culture Islamic world utter nonsense. In end, however, McChrystal got almost exactly wanted. On December 1st, speech West Point, president laid reasons fighting war Afghanistan bad idea: It's expensive; we're economic crisis; decade-long commitment would sap American power; Al Qaeda shifted base operations Pakistan. Then, without ever using words "victory" "win," Obama announced would send additional 30,000 troops Afghanistan, almost many McChrystal requested. The president thrown weight, however hesitantly, behind counterinsurgency crowd. Today, McChrystal gears offensive southern Afghanistan, prospects kind success look bleak. In June, death toll U.S. troops passed 1,000, number IEDs doubled. Spending hundreds billions dollars fifth-poorest country earth failed win civilian population, whose attitude toward U.S. troops ranges intensely wary openly hostile. Thetiggest military operation year — ferocious offensive began February retake southern town Marja — continues drag on, prompting McChrystal refer "bleeding ulcer." In June, Afghanistan officially outpaced Vietnam longest war American history — Obama quietly begun back away deadline set withdrawing U.S. troops July next year. The president finds stuck something even insane quagmire: quagmire knowingly walked into, even though it's precisely kind gigantic, mind-numbing, multigenerational nation-building project explicitly said didn't want. Even support McChrystal strategy counterinsurgency know whatever general manages accomplish Afghanistan, it's going look like Vietnam Desert Storm. "It's going look like win, smell like win taste like win," says Maj. Gen. Bill Mayville, serves chief operations McChrystal. "This going end argument." The night speech Paris, McChrystal staff head Kitty O'Shea's, Irish pub catering tourists, around corner hotel. His wife, Annie, joined rare visit: Since Iraq War began 2003, seen husband less 30 days year. Though Annie's 33rd wedding anniversary, McChrystal invited inner circle along dinner drinks "least Gucci" place staff could find. His wife isn't surprised. "He took Jack Box I dressed formalwear," says laugh. The general's staff handpicked collection killers, spies, geniuses, patriots, political operators outright maniacs. There's former head British Special Forces, two Navy Seals, Afghan Special Forces commando, lawyer, two fighter pilots least two dozen combat veterans counterinsurgency experts. They jokingly refer Team America, taking name South Park-esque sendup military cluelessness, pride can-do attitude disdain authority. After arriving Kabul last summer, Team America set changing culture International Security Assistance Force, NATO-led mission known. (U.S. soldiers taken deriding ISAF short "I Suck Fighting" "In Sandals Flip-Flops.") McChrystal banned alcohol base, kicked Burger King symbols American excess, expanded morning briefing include thousands officers refashioned command center Situational Awareness Room, free-flowing information hub modeled Mayor Mike Bloomberg's offices New York. He also set manic pace staff, becoming legendary sleeping four hours night, running seven miles morning, eating one meal day. (In month I spend around general, I witness eating once.) It's kind superhuman narrative built around him, staple almost every media profile, ability go without sleep food translates possibility man single-handedly winning war. By midnight Kitty O'Shea's, much Team America completely shitfaced. Two officers Irish jig mixed steps traditional Afghan wedding dance, McChrystal's top advisers lock arms sing slurred song invention."Afghanistan!" bellow."Afghanistan!" They call Afghanistan song. McChrystal steps away circle, observing team. "All men," tells me. "I'd die them. And they'd die me." The assembled men may look sound like bunch combat veterans letting steam, fact tight-knit group represents powerful force shaping U.S. policy Afghanistan. While McChrystal men indisputable command military aspects war, equivalent position diplomatic political side. Instead, assortment administration players compete Afghan portfolio: U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, Special Representative Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke, National Security Advisor Jim Jones Secretary State Hillary Clinton, mention 40 coalition ambassadors host talking heads try insert mess, John Kerry John McCain. This diplomatic incoherence effectively allowed McChrystal's team call shots hampered efforts build stable credible government Afghanistan. "It jeopardizes mission," says Stephen Biddle, senior fellow Council Foreign Relations supports McChrystal. "The military cannot create governance reform." Part problem structural: The Defense Department budget exceeds $600 billion year, State Department receives $50 billion. But part problem personal: In private, Team McChrystal likes talk shit many Obama's top people diplomatic side. One aide calls Jim Jones, retired four-star general veteran Cold War, "clown" remains "stuck 1985." Politicians like McCain Kerry, says another aide, "turn up, meeting Karzai, criticize airport press conference, get back Sunday talk shows. Frankly, it's helpful." Only Hillary Clinton receives good reviews McChrystal's inner circle. "Hillary Stan's back strategic review," says adviser. "She said, 'If Stan wants it, give needs.'" McChrystal reserves special skepticism Holbrooke, official charge reintegrating Taliban. "The Boss says he's like wounded animal," says member general's team. "Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors he's going get fired, makes dangerous. He's brilliant guy, comes in, pulls lever, whatever grasp onto. But COIN, can't someone yanking shit." At one point trip Paris, McChrystal checks BlackBerry. "Oh, another e-mail Holbrooke," groans. "I don't even want open it." He clicks message reads salutation loud, stuffs BladkBerry back pocket, bothering conceal annoyance. "Make sure don't get leg," aide jokes, referring e-mail. By far crucial — strained — relationship McChrystal Eikenberry, U.S. ambassador. According close two men, Eikenberry — retired three-star general served Afghanistan 2002 2005 — can't stand former subordinate calling shots. He's also furious McChrystal, backed NATO's allies, refused put Eikenberry pivotal role viceroy Afghanistan, would made diplomatic equivalent general. The job instead went British Ambassador Mark Sedwill — move effectively increased McChrystal's influence diplomacy shutting powerful rival. "In reality, position needs filled American weight," says U.S. official familiar negotiations. The relationship strained January, classified cable Eikenberry wrote leaked The New York Times. The cable scathing prescient. The ambassador offered brutal critique McChrystal's strategy, dismissed President Hamid Karzai "not adequate strategic partner," cast doubt whether counterinsurgency plan would "sufficient" deal Al Qaeda. "We become deeply engaged way extricate ourselves," Eikenberry warned, "short allowing country descend lawlessness chaos." McChrystal team blindsided cable. "I like Karl, I've known years, they'd never said anything like us before," says McChrystal, adds felt "betrayed" leak. "Here's one covers flank history books. Now fail, say, 'I told so.'" The striking example McChrystal's usurpation diplomatic policy handling Karzai. It McChrystal, diplomats like Eikenberry Holbrooke, enjoys best relationship man America relying lead Afghanistan. The doctrine counterinsurgency requires credible government, since Karzai considered credible people, McChrystal worked hard make so. Over past months, accompanied president 10 trips around country, standing beside political meetings, shuras, Kandahar. In February, day doomed offensive Marja, McChrystal even drove president's palace get sign would largest military operation year. Karzai's staff, however, insisted president sleeping cold could disturbed. After several hours haggling, McChrystal finally enlisted aid Afghanistan's defense minister, persuaded Karzai's people wake president nap. This one central flaws McChrystal's counterinsurgency strategy: The need build credible government puts us mercy whatever tin-pot leader we've backed — danger Eikenberry explicitly warned cable. Even Team McChrystal privately acknowledges Karzai less-than-ideal partner. "He's locked palace past year," laments one general's top advisers. At times, Karzai actively undermined McChrystal's desire put charge. During recent visit Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Karzai met three U.S. soldiers wounded Uruzgan province. "General," called McChrystal, "I didn't even know fighting Uruzgan!" Growing military brat, McChrystal exhibited mixture brilliance cockiness would follow throughout career. His father fought Korea Vietnam, retiring two-star general, four brothers joined armed services. Moving around different bases, McChrystal took solace baseball, sport made pretense hiding superiority: In Little League, would call strikes crowd whipping fastball middle. McChrystal entered West Point 1972, U.S. military close all-time low popularity. His class last graduate academy started admit women. The "Prison Hudson," known then, potent mix testosterone, hooliganism reactionary patriotism. Cadets repeatedly trashed mess hall food fights, birthdays celebrated tradition called "rat fucking," often left birthday boy outside snow mud, covered shaving cream. "It pretty control," says Lt. Gen. David Barno, classmate went serve top commander Afghanistan 2003 2005. The class, filled Barno calls "huge talent" "wild-eyed teenagers strong sense idealism," also produced Gen. Ray Odierno, current commander U.S. forces Iraq. The son general, McChrystal also ringleader campus dissidents — dual role taught thrive rigid, top-down environment thumbing nose authority every chance got. He accumulated 100 hours demerits drinking, partying insubordination — record classmates boasted made "century man." One classmate, asked named, recalls finding McChrystal passed shower downing case beer hidden sink. The troublemaking almost got kicked out, spent hours subjected forced marches Area, paved courtyard unruly cadets disciplined. "I'd come visit, I'd end spending time library, Stan Area," recalls Annie, began dating McChrystal 1973. McChrystal wound ranking 298 class 855, serious underachievement man widely regarded brilliant. His compelling work extracurricular: As managing editor The Pointer, West Point literary magazine, McChrystal wrote seven short stories eerily foreshadow many issues would confront career. In one tale, fictional officer complains difficulty training foreign troops fight; another, 19-year- old soldier kills boy mistakes terrorist. In "Brinkman's Note," piece suspense fiction, unnamed narrator appears trying stop plot assassinate president. It turns out, however, narrator assassin, he's able infiltrate White House: "The President strode smiling. From right coat pocket raincoat I carried, I slowly drew forth 32-caliber pistol. In Brinkman's failure, I succeeded." After graduation, 2nd Lt. Stanley McChrystal entered Army broken wake Vietnam. "We really felt peacetime generation," recalls. "There Gulf War, even didn't feel like big deal." So McChrystal spent career action was: He enrolled Special Forces school became regimental commander 3rd Ranger Battalion 1986. It dangerous position, even peacetime — nearly two dozen Rangers killed training accidents Eighties. It also unorthodox career path: Most soldiers want climb ranks general don't go Rangers. Displaying penchant transforming systems considers outdated, McChrystal set revolutionize training regime Rangers. He introduced mixed martial arts, required every soldier qualify night-vision goggles rifle range forced troops build endurance weekly marches involving heavy backpacks. In late 1990s, McChrystal shrewdly improved inside game, spending year Harvard's Kennedy School Government Council Foreign Relations, co-authored treatise merits drawbacks humanitarian interventionism. But moved ranks, McChrystal relied skills learned troublemaking kid West Point: knowing precisely far could go rigid military hierarchy without getting tossed out. Being highly intelligent badass, discovered, could take far — especially political chaos followed September 11th. "He focused," says Annie. "Even young officer seemed know wanted do. I don't think personality changed years." By accounts, McChrystal's career least two times now. As Pentagon spokesman invasion Iraq, general seemed like White House mouthpiece up-and-coming commander reputation speaking mind. When Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made infamous "stuff happens" remark looting Baghdad, McChrystal backed up. A days later, echoed president's Mission Accomplished gaffe insisting major combat operations Iraq over. But next stint — overseeing military's elite units, including Rangers, Navy Seals Delta Force — McChrystal took part cover-up would destroyed career lesser man. After Cpl. Pat Tillman, former-NFL-star-turned-Ranger, accidentally killed troops Afghanistan April 2004, McChrystal took active role creating impression Tillman died hands Taliban fighters. He signed falsified recommendation Silver Star suggested Tillman killed enemy fire. (McChrystal would later claim didn't read recommendation closely enough — strange excuse commander known laserlike attention minute details.) A week later, McChrystal sent memo chain command, specifically warning President Bush avoid mentioning cause Tillman's death. "If circumstances Corporal Tillman's death become public," wrote, could cause "public embarrassment" president. "The false narrative, McChrystal clearly helped construct, diminished Pat's true actions," wrote Tillman's mother, Mary, book Boots Ground Dusk. McChrystal got away it, added, "golden boy" Rumsfeld Bush, loved willingness get things done, even included bending rules skipping chain command. Nine days Tillman's death, McChrystal promoted major general. Two years later, 2006, McChrystal tainted scandal involving detainee abuse torture Camp Nama Iraq. According report Human Rights Watch, prisoners camp subjected now-familiar litany abuse: stress positions, dragged naked mud. McChrystal disciplined scandal, even though interrogator camp reported seeing inspect prison multiple times. But experience unsettling McChrystal tried prevent detainee operations placed command Afghanistan, viewing "political swamp," according U.S. official. In May 2009, McChrystal prepared confirmation hearings, staff prepared hard questions Camp Nama Tillman cover-up. But scandals barely made ripple Congress, McChrystal soon way back Kabul run war Afghanistan. The media, large extent, also given McChrystal pass controversies. Where Gen. Petraeus kind dweeb, teacher's pet Ranger's tab, McChrystal snake-eating rebel, "Jedi" commander, Newsweek called him. He didn't care teenage son came home blue hair mohawk. He speaks mind candor rare high-ranking official. He asks opinions, seems genuinely interested response. He gets briefings iPod listens books tape. He carries custom-made set nunchucks convoy engraved name four stars, itinerary often bears fresh quote Bruce Lee. ("There limits. There plateaus, must stay there, must go beyond them.") He went dozens nighttime raids time Iraq, unprecedented top commander, turned missions unannounced, almost entourage. "The fucking lads love Stan McChrystal," says British officer serves Kabul. "You'd Somewhere, Iraq, someone would take knee beside you, corporal would like 'Who fuck that?' And it's fucking Stan McChrystal." It doesn't hurt McChrystal also extremely successful head Joint Special Operations Command, elite forces carry government's darkest ops. During Iraq surge, team killed captured thousands insurgents, including Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, leader Al Qaeda Iraq. "JSOC killing machine," says Maj. Gen. Mayville, chief operations. McChrystal also open new ways killing. He systematically mapped terrorist networks, targeting specific insurgents hunting — often help cyberfreaks traditionally shunned military. "The Boss would find 24-year-old kid nose ring, fucking brilliant degree MIT, sitting corner 16 computer monitors humming," says Special Forces commando worked McChrystal Iraq serves staff Kabul. "He'd say, 'Hey — fucking muscleheads couldn't find lunch without help. You got work together guys.'" Even new role America's leading evangelist counterinsurgency, McChrystal retains deep-seated instincts terrorist hunter. To put pressure Taliban, upped number Special Forces units Afghanistan four 19. "You better hitting four five targets tonight," McChrystal tell Navy Seal sees hallway headquarters. Then he'll add, "I'm going scold morning it, though." In fact, general frequently finds apologizing disastrous consequences counterinsurgency. In first four months year, NATO forces killed 90 civilians, 76 percent period 2009 — record created tremendous resentment among population COIN theory intent winning over. In February, Special Forces night raid ended deaths two pregnant Afghan women allegations cover-up, April, protests erupted Kandahar U.S. forces accidentally shot bus, killing five Afghans. "We've shot amazing number people," McChrystal recently conceded. Despite tragedies miscues, McChrystal issued strictest directives avoid civilian casualties U.S. military ever encountered war zone. It's "insurgent math," calls — every innocent person kill, create 10 new enemies. He ordered convoys curtail reckless driving, put restrictions use air power severely limited night raids. He regularly apologizes Hamid Karzai civilians killed, berates commanders responsible civilian deaths. "For while," says one U.S. official, "the dangerous place Afghanistan front McChrystal 'civ cas' incident." The ISAF command even discussed ways make killing something win award for: There's talk creating new medal "courageous restraint," buzzword that's unlikely gain much traction gung-ho culture U.S. military. But however strategic may be, McChrystal's new marching orders caused intense backlash among troops. Being told hold fire, soldiers complain, puts greater danger. "Bottom line?" says former Special Forces operator spent years Iraq Afghanistan. "I would love kick McChrystal nuts. His rules engagement put soldiers' lives even greater danger. Every real soldier tell thing." In March, McChrystal traveled Combat Outpost JFM — small encampment outskirts Kandahar — confront accusations troops directly. It typically bold move general. Only two days earlier, received e-mail Israel Arroyo, 25-year-old staff sergeant asked McChrystal go mission unit. "I writing said don't care troops made harder defend ourselves," Arroyo wrote. Within hours, McChrystal responded personally: "I'm saddened accusation I don't care soldiers, something I suspect soldier takes personally professionally — least I do. But I know perceptions depend upon perspective time, I respect every soldier's view own." Then showed Arroyo's outpost went foot patrol troops — bullshit photo-op stroll market, real live operation dangerous war zone. Six weeks later, McChrystal returned Paris, general received another e-mail Arroyo. A 23-year- old corporal named Michael Ingram — one soldiers McChrystal gone patrol — killed IED day earlier. It third man 25-member platoon lost year, Arroyo writing see general would attend Ingram's memorial service. "He started look you," Arroyo wrote. McChrystal said would try make pay respects soon possible. The night general scheduled visit Sgt. Arroyo's platoon memorial, I arrive Combat Outpost JFM speak soldiers gone patrol with. JFM small encampment, ringed high blast walls guard towers. Almost soldiers repeated combat tours Iraq Afghanistan, seen worst fighting wars. But especially angered Ingram's death. His commanders repeatedly requested permission tear house Ingram killed, noting often used combat position Taliban. But due McChrystal's new restrictions avoid upsetting civilians, request denied. "These abandoned houses," fumes Staff Sgt. Kennith Hicks. "Nobody coming back live them." One soldier shows list new regulations platoon given. "Patrol areas reasonably certain defend lethal force," laminated card reads. For soldier traveled halfway around world fight, that's like telling cop patrol areas knows won't make arrests. "Does make fucking sense?" asks Pfc. Jared Pautsch. "We drop fucking bomb place. You sit ask yourself: What here?" The rules handed McChrystal intended — they've distorted passed chain command — knowing nothing lessen anger troops ground. "Fuck, I came heard McChrystal charge, I thought would get fucking gun on," says Hicks, served three tours combat. "I get COIN. I get that. McChrystal comes here, explains it, makes sense. But goes away bird, time directives get passed us Big Army, they're fucked — either somebody trying cover ass, don't understand themselves. But we're fucking losing thing." McChrystal team show next day. Underneath tent, general 45-minute discussion two dozen soldiers. The atmosphere tense. "I ask what's going world, I think it's important understand big picture well," McChrystal begins. "How's company doing? You guys feeling sorry yourselves? Anybody? Anybody feel like you're losing?" McChrystal says. "Sir, guys here, sir, think we're losing, sir," says Hicks. McChrystal nods. "Strength leading don't want lead," tells men. "You're leading example. That's do. Particularly it's really, really hard, hurts inside." Then spends 20 minutes talking counterinsurgency, diagramming concepts principles whiteboard. He makes COIN seem like common sense, he's careful bullshit men. "We knee-deep decisive year," tells them. The Taliban, insists, longer initiative — "but I don't think do, either." It's similar talk gave Paris, it's winning hearts minds among soldiers. "This philosophical part works think tanks," McChrystal tries joke. "But doesn't get reception infantry companies." During question-and-answer period, frustration boils over. The soldiers complain allowed use lethal force, watching insurgents detain freed lack evidence. They want able fight — like Iraq, like Afghanistan McChrystal. 'We aren't putting fear Taliban," one soldier says. "Winning hearts minds COIN coldblooded thing," McChrystal says, citing oft-repeated maxim can't kill way Afghanistan. "The Russians killed 1 million Afghans, didn't work." "I'm saying go kill everybody, sir," soldier persists. "You say we've stopped momentum insurgency. I don't believe that's true area. The pull back, restrain ourselves, stronger it's getting." "I agree you," McChrystal says. "In area, we've made progress, probably. You show strength here, use fire. What I'm telling is, fire costs you. What want do? You want wipe population resettle it?" A soldier complains rules, insurgent doesn't weapon immediately assumed civilian. "That's way game is," McChrystal says. "It's complex. I can't decide: It's shirts skins, we'll kill shirts." As discussion ends, McChrystal seems sense hasn't succeeded easing men's anger. He makes one last-ditch effort reach them, acknowledging death Cpl. Ingram. "There's way I make easier," tells them. "No way I pretend won't hurt. No way I tell feel that. . . . I tell you, you're great job. Don't let frustration get you." The session ends clapping, real resolution. McChrystal may sold President Obama counterinsurgency, many men aren't buying it. When comes Afghanistan, history McChrystal's side. The foreign invader success Genghis Khan — wasn't hampered things like human rights, economic development press scrutiny. The COIN doctrine, bizarrely, draws inspiration biggest Western military embarrassments recent memory: France's nasty war Algeria (lost 1962) American misadventure Vietnam (lost 1975). McChrystal, like advocates COIN, readily acknowledges counterinsurgency campaigns inherently messy, expensive easy lose. "Even Afghans confused Afghanistan," says. But even somehow manages succeed, years bloody fighting Afghan kids pose threat U.S. homeland, war little shut Al Qaeda, shifted operations Pakistan. Dispatching 150,000 troops build new schools, roads, mosques water-treatment facilities around Kandahar like trying stop drug war Mexico occupying Arkansas building Baptist churches Little Rock. "It's cynical, politically," says Marc Sageman, former CIA case officer extensive experience region. "Afghanistan vital interest — there's nothing us there." In mid-May, two weeks visiting troops Kandahar, McChrystal travels White House high-level visit Hamid Karzai. It triumphant moment general, one demonstrates much command — Kabul Washington. In East Room, packed journalists dignitaries, President Obama sings praises Karzai. The two leaders talk great relationship is, pain feel civilian casualties. They mention word "progress" 16 times hour. But mention victory. Still, • session represents forceful commitment Obama made McChrystal's strategy months. "There denying progress Afghan people made recent years — education, health care economic development," president says. "As I saw lights across Kabul I landed — lights would visible years earlier." It disconcerting observation Obama make. During worst years Iraq, Bush administration real progress point to, officials used offer exact evidence success. "It one first impressions," one GOP official said 2006, landing Baghdad height sectarian violence. "So many lights shining brightly." So language Iraq War Obama administration turned — talk progress, city lights, metrics like health care education. Rhetoric years ago would mocked. "They trying manipulate perceptions definition victory — victory even defined recognizable," says Celeste Ward, senior defense analyst RAND Corporation served political adviser U.S. commanders Iraq 2006. "That's game we're right now. What need, strategic purposes, create perception didn't get run off. The facts ground great, going become great near future." But facts ground, history proven, offer little deterrent military determined stay course. Even closest McChrystal know rising anti-war sentiment home doesn't begin reflect deeply fucked things Afghanistan. "If Americans pulled back started paying attention war, would become even less popular," senior adviser McChrystal says. Such realism, however, doesn't prevent advocates counterinsurgency dreaming big: Instead beginning withdraw troops next year, Obama promised, military hopes ramp counterinsurgency campaign even further. "There's possibility could ask another surge U.S. forces next summer see success here," senior military official Kabul tells me. Back Afghanistan, less month White House meeting Karzai talk "progress," McChrystal hit biggest blow vision counterinsurgency. Since last year, Pentagon planning launch major military operation summer Kandahar, country's second-largest city Taliban's original home base. It supposed decisive turning point war — primary reason troop surge McChrystal wrested Obama late last year. But June 10th, acknowledging military still needs lay groundwork, general announced postponing offensive fall. Rather one big battle, like Fallujah Ramadi, U.S. troops implement McChrystal calls "rising tide security." The Afghan police army enter Kandahar attempt seize control neighborhoods, U.S. pours $90 million aid city win civilian population. Even proponents counterinsurgency hard-pressed explain new plan. "This isn't classic operation," says U.S. military official. "It's going Black Hawk Down. There aren't going doors kicked in." Other U.S. officials insist doors going kicked in, it's going kinder, gentler offensive disaster Marja. "The Taliban jackboot city," says military official. "We remove them, way doesn't alienate population." When Vice President Biden briefed new plan Oval Office, insiders say shocked see much mirrored gradual plan counterterrorism advocated last fall. "This looks like CT-plus!" said, according U.S. officials familiar meeting. Whatever nature new plan, delay underscores fundamental flaws counterinsurgency. After nine years war, Taliban simply remains strongly entrenched U.S. military openly attack. The people COIN seeks win — Afghan people — want us there. Our supposed ally, President Karzai, used influence delay offensive, massive influx aid championed McChrystal likely make things worse. "Throwing money problem exacerbates problem," says Andrew Wilder, expert Tufts University studied effect aid southern Afghanistan. "A tsunami cash fuels corruption, delegitimizes government creates environment we're picking winners losers" — process fuels resentment hostility among civilian population. So far, counterinsurgency succeeded creating never-ending demand primary product supplied military: perpetual war. There reason President Obama studiously avoids using word "victory" talks Afghanistan. Winning, would seem, really possible. Not even Stanley McChrystal charge.
