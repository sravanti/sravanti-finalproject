I joked I Twilt.- -s ,rgc, two dozen times I seen Petraeus first time I'd seen uniform, ice cold shudder fear would spread quickly political circles DC. In August 2007, I wroteoiece, stating folks keep eye possibility General Petraeus might run President 2012. In April 2008, Steven Lee Myers wrote solid New York Times follow titled "The General" referencing earlier take. Recently, legendary newsman Ai:nai4d de 13orchgave resuscitated topic Eisenhoweresque future counterinsurgency guru piece, "President ?etraeus7" Petraeus recently named one Foreign Policy magazine's tip 100 ttzal thinkers, U.S. News & World Reports "Washington Whispers" notes, going speaking May 2010 annual American Enterprise Institute dinner receiving Irving Kristol Award. In January 2010, Public Policy Pollin.q revealed Obama held ten point lead potential wild card race Petraeus, General strengths. But pollsters also noted many American public didn't know enough yet Petraeus form opinion: Finally blog readers voted David Petraeus wild card Republican month numbers come mixed bag. He largest deficit Obama, trailing 44-34. But +13 net favorability better President Republicans tested. The problem numbers break 25/12- 63% voters country don't know enough formed opinion. Who knows Petraeus would actually interest going politics, would introducing many voters first time. President Obama himself, according aides reported me, quite taken David Petraeus respects approach thinking. Petraeus also respectful President -- although pushed recent forum might react Presidential decision Afghanistan General might liked, Petraeus offered cryptic rather clear response. (see video) At "First Draft History" meeting sponsored Atlantic Monthly/Atlantic Media Group, Newseum, Aspen Institute; Petraeus asked would support President matter result strategic review Afghanistan responded "would continue give President best professional military advice could." Contrast Defense Secretary Robert Gates resoonOinato_the..saest.ipr .j., "We salute execute [the President's] decisions faithfully best ability." But spending evening General Petraeus watching closely number years, way intelligent leader -- I disagreements respect -- could comfortable Tea Party takeover Republican political machine. There always possibility core reasonable Republicans like Michael Bloomberg, James Baker, Olympia Snowe, Chuck Hegel, Alan Simpson, John Whitehead, Peter Peterson, Rita Hauser others try rekindle classic Republican sensibilities fighting re-hijack party back Eisenhower-like campaign Petraeus lead. Remember Eisenhower clinched Republican nomination promising President though knew war would end Korean War. Petraeus knows Afghanistan Iraq -- though seems hard envision today could kind leader promising end wars Obama proves unable so. But another option intrigues seems realistic imagining iconic David Petraeus running President -- running Vice President. I think Vice President Joe Biden done outstanding job big guns Obama White House, Biden done best job outperforming expectations. He given President Obama much needed counsel, always taken regrettably, counsel Obama needed show American public getting. Biden key agent behind scenes moving Iraq's elections forward. He scored lot wins -- reported -- nuclear/WMD controls arena. Biden worked Gates stabilizing awkward complex relationship Russia -- counterpoints Afghanistan surge, view, remain compelling. But Biden going find way hold spot 2012 others going gunning it. As I look now, Hillary Clinton said one term Secretary State would natural candidate Obama VP slot. Her franchise completely control Obama team yet, moving Hillary closer White House (although private home Whitehaven Street actually couple hundred feet closer White House VP residence Naval Observatory) would finalize Obarna's takeover key political franchises Democratic Party -- starting Daley's machine, Deschle's machine, Kennedy's machine, Edwards' machine, Clintons'. But General David Petraeus, business suit, lurks there. Obama seems concerned looking like weak national security. The Republicans -- Cheney's constant goading (and Sarah Palin's) -- seem want continue play politics fear-mongering. Obama could neutralize possibility faces Republican party challenge David Petraeus inviting General 2012 ticket Democrat. Crazy? Perhaps. But inviting potential rivals tent becoming standard Obama trademark -- much appointing Republican Governor Utah former G.W. Bush administration Deputy US Trade Representative Jon Huntsman, Jr. serve US Ambassador People's Republic China. And get this, learned David Petraeus voted since 2002 -- doesn't care vote -- reportedly wants keep eventual political options political loyalties open. This soldier options table keeping powder dry. My hunch whether Obama sticks Vice President Biden pivots someone else, Petraeus short list considered. -- Steve Clemons publishes popular political blog, The Washington Note.
