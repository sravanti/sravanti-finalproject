pvervee Secretary Clinton — I understand going Kenya next week I know trip primarily focused trade issues, I wanted flag issue I know near dear heart. Kenya one strictest anti-abortion laws Africa — illegal unless woman's life risk criminalizes woman provider. Two years ago, Kenyan authorities imprisoned doctor two nurses, falsely accusing providing illegal abortions. After year prison, providers found innocent released, galvanized legal provider community formed coalition make abortion less restrictive. It come surprise that, result abortion law, Kenya one highest maternal mortality rates Africa, estimated 800 women day seeking procedure, often dangerous means. Kenya restarting long-stalled constitutional review process hope produce final Constitution next year. Religious groups concerted crusade include new language Constitution would codify "life begins conception". The current Constitution largely silent issue. If fetal personhood amendment goes forward, would place Kenya small community nations provision. It would clearly mark Kenya stop countries attempting institutionalize African Union's Maputo Protocol, one progressive regional documents women, development reproductive rights, vast majority African countries general. For country trying regain momentum stability success enjoyed recently, policy imposition would regression women's rights country writ large. I went Kenya last month work coalition formed strategize Constitutional amendment work toward less restrictive abortion law. I also visited several clinics providers Nairobi nearby villages Planned Parenthood programs train providers post abortion care. You seen million times travels around world, I don't need tell poignant stories lives saved lost, bravery standing constant government harassment, fear potential Constitutional amendment mean provision safe medical services. I know asking lot, way could draw attention issue Kenya, would even personal hero already are. It hope Kenya knows world watching may careful proceed. Of course would happy help way decide want something there. There also Congressional delegation going Kenya week August 8th working side meeting issue well. As always, thank much do.
