Philippe Jake asked send along response Washington Post editorial: By Michael Posner The Post's Dec. 27 editorial ("Redefining Human Rights") Obama Administration's human rights democracy policies, Secretary Clinton's recent speech Georgetown particular, misses critical point: human rights, democracy, development mutually reinforcing, competing goals. They complement task making human rights human reality. President Roosevelt understood fundamental link liberty, prosperity security, tying together freedom speech worship freedom want freedom fear famous "Four Freedoms" speech. At Georgetown, Secretary Clinton articulated 21st century vision grounded wisdom. To accuse Secretary Clinton embracing Soviet-bloc approach human rights includes development discussion democracy strains bonds credulity common sense, also walls crucial avenue ensuring people actually exercise rights naturally - including rights freedom religion, association, speech-in daily lives. As Secretary Clinton made clear, policies address development alone adequate: "Freedom doesn't come half measures, partial remedies solve whole problem," said. But experience shows us broad-based development occurs, people likely demand say securing futures, governments likely resources maintain strong institutions, including reliable police fair courts, help ensure consistent protection rights. Where people given right speak freely, participate nation's political process access basic information government, sustainable development likely occur. At time, democracies without development last. These mutually reinforcing tracks, Obama Administration committed pursuing simultaneously. As President Obama said Nobel lecture, "engagement repressive regimes lacks satisfying purity indignation." But Post's overheated outrage ignores lessons learned generations men women worked advance human rights around world. To suggest Secretary Clinton somehow provided excuses rights-abusing dictators speech forcefully criticized specific abuses across world, simply credible. Far excuse regime, approach pushes governments advance civil political rights ensure democracy actually delivers measure prosperity opportunity all. That right approach Obama Administration 21st century. ###
