Sid http://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/03/14/the_petraeus_briefing_biden_s_embarrassment_is_not_the_whole_sto ry The Petraeus briefing: Biden's embarrassment whole story Posted By Mark Perry 4Saturday, March 13, 2010 - On Jan. 16, two days killer earthquake hit Haiti, team senior military officers U.S. Central Command (responsible overseeing American security interests Middle East), arrived Pentagon brief Joint Chiefs Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The team dispatched CENTCOM commander Gen. David Petraeus underline growing worries lack progress resolving issue. The 33- slide, 45-minute PowerPoint briefing stunned Mullen. The briefers reported growing perception among Arab leaders U.S. incapable standing Israel, CENTCOM's mostly Arab constituency losing faith American promises, Israeli intransigence Israeli-Palestinian conflict jeopardizing U.S. standing region, Mitchell (as senior Pentagon officer later bluntly described it) "too old, slow ... late." The January Mullen briefing unprecedented. No previous CENTCOM commander ever expressed essentially political issue; briefers careful tell Mullen conclusions followed December 2009 tour region where, Petraeus's instructions, spoke senior Arab leaders. "Everywhere went, message pretty humbling," Pentagon officer familiar briefing says. "America viewed weak, military posture region eroding." But Petraeus wasn't finished: two days Mullen briefing, Petraeus sent paper White House requesting West Bank Gaza (which, Israel, part European Command -- EUCOM), made part area operations. Petraeus's reason straightforward: U.S. troops deployed Iraq Afghanistan, U.S. military perceived Arab leaders engaged region's troublesome conflict. [UPDATE: A senior military officer denied Sunday Petraeus sent paper White House. "CENTCOM team brief CJCS concerns revolving around Palestinian issue, CENTCOM propose UCP change, CJCS, WH," officer said via email. "GEN Petraeus certain might conveyed WH (if anything) brief CJCS." (UCP means "unified combatant command," like CENTCOM; CJCS refers Mullen; WH White House.)] The Mullen briefing Petraeus's request hit White House like bombshell. While Petraeus's request CENTCOM expanded include Palestinians denied ("it dead arrival," Pentagon officer confirms), Obama administration decided would redouble efforts -- pressing Israel settlements issue, sending Mitchell visit number Arab capitals dispatching Mullen carefully arranged meeting chief Israeli General Staff, Lt. General Gabi Ashkenazi. While American press speculated Mullen's trip focused Iran, JCS Chairman actually carried blunt, tough, message Israeli-Palestinian conflict: Israel see conflict Palestinians "in larger, regional, context" -- direct impact America's status region. Certainly, thought, Israel would get message. Israel didn't. When Vice President Joe Biden embarrassed Israeli announcement Netanyahu government building 1,600 new homes East Jerusalem, administration reacted. But one outraged Biden who, according Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth, engaged private, angry, exchange Israeli Prime Minister. Not surprisingly, Biden told Netanyahu reflected importance administration attached Petraeus's Mullen briefing: "This starting get dangerous us," Biden reportedly told Netanyahu. "What you're undermines security troops fighting Iraq, Afghanistan Pakistan. That endangers us endangers regional peace." Yedioth Ahronoth went report: "The vice president told Israeli hosts since many people Muslim world perceived connection Israel's actions US policy, decision construction undermines Palestinian rights East Jerusalem could impact personal safety American troops fighting Islamic terrorism." The message couldn't plainer: Israel's intransigence could cost American lives. There important powerful lobbies America: NRA, American Medical Association, lawyers -- Israeli lobby. But lobby important, powerful, U.S. military. While commentators pundits might reflect Joe Biden's trip Israel forever shifted America's relationship erstwhile ally region, real break came January, David Petraeus sent briefing team Pentagon stark warning: America's relationship Israel important, important lives America's soldiers. Maybe Israel gets message now. Mark Perry's newest book Talking To Terrorists http://warincontext.org/2olo/o3/14/israel-is-putting-american-liyes-at-risk/ My piece briefing Admiral Mullen CENTCOM senior officers occasioned great deal comment, well skepticism: accurate account? Was told direct participants briefing? Is basis imagining Petraeus kind hidden agenda, whether desire expand CENTCOM — even hostility towards Israel. I won't name sources, even though it's clear people Pentagon — certainly General Petraeus — are. Was I told briefing briefers themselves? I say four people briefing — two briefers, Admiral Mullen, Admiral Mullen's primary adviser Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I know two people involved briefing. Whether sources something reader determine. The account accurate, it's precis actually happened. There lot it. The White House, State Department Pentagon denied account, good reason: it's true. Is basis imagining Petraeus kind hidden agenda ordering briefing? I reporting American military thirty years. My work Joint Chiefs Staff, Four Stars, authoritative account subject. I deeply rooted contacts military go back thirty years. I never met senior military officer I admire. There greater insult believe General Petraeus senior American military officer would use lives American soldiers lever enhance political future. My sense General Petraeus neither likes dislikes Israel: loves country wants protect soldiers. The current crisis American relations Israel litmus test General Petraeus's loyalty Israel, his, our, concern Americans uniform Middle East. It is, perhaps, sign depth "the Biden crisis" every controversy type seems get translated whether America leaders committed Israel's security. This isn't Israel's security, it's security. http://maxblumenthal.com/2010/03/pastor-hagee-and- netanyahus-lovefest-on-eve-of-bidens-arrival-in-israel/ Netanyahu Pastor Hagee's Lovefest Eve Biden's Arrival Israel On 03.09.10, By Max (Videos recorded Rachel Tabachnick; videos coming shortly.)
