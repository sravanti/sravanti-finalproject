Under-Skin Defibrillators Seen Closer Reality By BARRY MEIER The likelihood patients United States may day receive heart defibrillators operate without electrical wires connected hearts moved step closer, according study published Wednesday. The development new type defibrillator long pursued researcher, Dr. Gust H. Bardy, Seattle Institute Cardiac Research Seattle. And study The New England Journal Medicine, Dr. Bardy researchers reported initial trials device patients successful. Defibrillators fire electrical jolt interrupt potentially fatal heart rhythm restore normal beating. For unit function, surgeon must thread electrical sensing wire blood vessel patient's heart. The wires pose risks can, rare occasion, puncture heart implantation fracture place. The new version delivers electrical jolt means sensor implanted skin near chest bone. A power unit placed skin side chest. The new device already sale European countries, Dr. Bardy others cautioned full-scale, long- term trials still needed prove implant's worth Food Drug Administration. Even successful, unit could used patients needed defibrillator, several researchers said excited new study nonetheless. Dr. Douglas P. Zipes, professor Indiana University School Medicine Indianapolis, said new device could someday displace existing models used many patients Every month, 10,000 patients country get defibrillator, either first time replacements devices whose batteries worn out. In recent years, safety defibrillator wires come particular focus model made Medtronic prone fracturing. Hundreds patients received model undergo new operations replace it. Also, scar tissue often builds around intravenous wires, process make removing replacing difficult dangerous. Dr. Bardy said telephone interview deaths several patients many years ago wire-related injuries factor interest developing new device. "You looking therapy avert, hope, complications effective," said. In study published Wednesday, Dr. Bardy others reported new device undergone several successful initial trials, including one used year 60 patients. The device developed Cameron Health, small company San Clemente, Calif., co-founded Dr. Bardy. Since cardiologist began work project decade ago, defibrillator helped design gone several iterations. The device suitable significant number heart patients, particularly require units also include pacemaker, regulates heart beating fast slowly. But Dr. Bardy estimated device could work 25 percent patients get defibrillator. These largely patients risk, genetic factors certain types heart diseases, type erratic cardiac rhythm cause sudden death. Dr. Bardy said cost new device standard defibrillator. However, said could help reduce health care costs, implanting much simpler. Before device sold here, Cameron Health submit extensive human trial data theF.D.A.. Dr. Bardy said larger study device begun country overseas likely take year assemble data agency's review.
