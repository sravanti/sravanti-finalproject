Gentlemen, information below. Werner GFC To may concern experience speaking! RSO Niall, Please aware requested elaboration written format. As briefly discussed meeting today, LGF operate I would consider "Threshold' Sleep Deprivation. Further meaning, work schedule, hours sleeping pattern' LGF close edge serious sleep deprivation. When work go., , time ramp extra manpower (during scheduled days) due increased threw . etc...etc...; compound issue sleep deprivation. This ultimately dirninit,: LGF's ability provide security. To better explain, starts, LGF work 3 days transition (swing shift) . nights transition 3 days (it used 2x2x2). Each work day equals 14 actin I I!(-) work; Supervisor's average 15 hours per work day. Snap shot average day shift: 1. 05:00hrs every day, Shift Brief on-going shift, along "In-Service Training". .I Convoy Brief, followed convoy load time organization entire shift (approx day) followed actual convoy movement. 2. 05:45 06:15hrs. (approximately) shift change site, 3. 06:15 17:45, regular work day site. 4. 17:45 18:15, Shift change over, followed reorganization convoy off-going. slii actual convoy movement 5. 18:30 (approximately) Off-going shift returns Camp Sullivan, weapons equipment loaded convoy equipment stowed, vehicle's re-staged parking lot. 6. 19:00 (approximately) Off-going shift complete, equipment accounted secured, personnel time whether work train, eat dinner, watch movie, internet, phone calls, sleep etc. 7. 10 hours later, starts 05:00hrs Shift Brief taking considers tit wake-up grooming breakfast. This averages actual 14 hour day LGF member. Some days short a, hours days long 14.5 hours. Supervisor's average additional (approximate) 30 minutes prior shift conducting administrative duties ,;1 organization. All personal hygiene, laundry, personal e-mail/matters, Physical fitness, usually meals sleep must conducted within 10 hour window individual's shifts. After completing 3 days work cycle ends 19:00hrs, shifts swings night shift schedule. Their next duty starts 17:00hrs following day evening briefmg. This 22 hour transition window LGF sleep 14 hour schedule first night shift. This viewed gea one good sleep 36 hours window time (by end first night shift, fol two night shifts). When finishing last night shift, immediately off, however, working ah (arriving back Camp Sullivan around 06:30) sleep first day off. They adjust back night-time sleeping pattern. The second day designated training day. Third day scheduled day. If average work schedule course month, LGF member transitio', day night sleeping pattern average 7 times. It's nearly impossible establish rhythmic sleeping pattern. This causes sleep deprivation. You see efftiek course time. When shift gets back ground R&R, fresh rt, energy, compared shift grind 7 8 weeks sometint,:.. 5 6 weeks. In summary, disruption addition current work schedule compounds t1. sleep deprivation sustainable LGF extended periods time.
