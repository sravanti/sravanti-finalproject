FYI, Gary Sick's latest analysis Iran (posted blog). Sick independent sources well informed. June 17, 2009 Is another Iranian revolution? To someone watched studied Iranian revolution 1979 fascination, developments Iran today eerie reminiscence. Then massive protests filled streets, often marching dignified ominous silence; bloodshed nervous security men guns faced determined unarmed crowds; sullen mourning parades;20there catchy chants ritual calls "Down shah!"; night rooftops rang shouts allahu akbar. You need change "shah" "dictator," description happening Iran today. But one big difference. Thirty years ago, Iran charismatic cleric named Ayatollah Khomeini refined sense strategy willingness risk everything cause represented. On side Mohammed Reza Shah, throne 37 years commanded one powerful military security regimes world. On surface appeared uneven battle — guns turbans — ruler guns wavered turbans grew size confidence old order collapsed. Today nominal leader opposition forces reformed radical, Mir Hossein Mousavi, notably lacking personal charisma. On side constitutional Leader, Ayatollah IChamene' i, widely perceived cautious political animal limited qualifications religious post compensates lack charisma manipulation political system institutions loyal — particularly politically minded clergy powerful security forces, including Revolutionary Guards. Neither men seems fully control forces, let alone situation. The fraudulent election defeat Mousavi triggering event, energy behind unprecedented demonstrations due sense outrage betrayal gross manipulation numbers regime undying devotion Mousavi. Yesterday Mousavi ordered people stay home face conflicting pro-regime demonstration. They marched anyway (and daughter former president Rafsanjani joined urged on). Mousavi "ordered" everyone march following day (which probably going without orders). IChamene'i announced "divine assessment" election outcome — even would probably physically possible count 40 million ballots. Then, face mass protests, ordered investigation results Guardian Council— organization responsible managing election first place. No one believed either case, one expected anything importance Guardian Council. Khamene'i ordered peace reconciliation. No one paid attention. I deliberately mention president-elect Ahmadinejad. After celebrating "victory," went largely symbolic meeting Moscow. He seems decision loop passive player major actor events. So calling shots? Mousavi seems running along crowd, leading it. But probably required keep protest motion. On side, little evidence suggests important decisions made ultra-conservative leadership Revolutionary Guards, whose political role ballooned past decade, perhaps cooperation extremist counterparts clergy. They utterly ruthless ideologically fueled. New York Times columnist Nick Kristoff reminded us several days ago (see blog item June 15 below) end day, I saw Tiananmen 20 years ago, Might Right battle, it's often prudent bet Might, least short run. The regime seems miscalculated badly. They seemed believe sudden coup — announcement dramatic election results followed show force — would intimidate silence opposition consolidate control. That perhaps understandable decisions made military leaders tend see battle Manichaean terms, rather politicians IChamene'i accustomed seeing shades gray. In event, b ackfired much larger crisis hands simply arranged Ahmadinejad win slim margin (which least believable). All parties uncharted territory. A significant portion Iranian population seems concluded social contract rulers — accepting Islamic rule return respectful regard opinion governed, Islamic Republic — longer valid. They trust rulers. The rulers, whose support declining years face inept management country, increasingly replacing popular support repression. This election seems called tactic question. For military, obvious answer repression. So would appear moment bet Might. But nobody fully command events. Decisions taken next weeks fateful could determine future path Iranian revolution. There another lesson Iran's leaders contemplate Tiananmen moment. When Tiananmen crackdown occurred almost exactly ten years ago, one leaders China time Zhao Ziyang, General Secretary Communist Party. He later fired placed house arrest. His smuggled memoirs appeared, revealing depth disagreements within lea dership proceed.
