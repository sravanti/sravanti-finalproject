Not iron curtain, iron intolerance politicians revert blaming minorities nations' woes. In Western Europe Muslims. In Eastern Europe Jews, Roma, gays. In Netherlands, Geert Wilders surged election victory March back anti-Muslim, anti-Quran populism. In Hungary Fidesz Party won big recent elections attacks "Jewish capital... wants devour entire world." To right Fidesz openly anti-Jewish Jobbik Party, won two seats fewer Socialists. Its leaders want wear neo-Nazi uniform pre-1939 Hungarian Guard take seats Budapest's Parliament. Contemporary political scientists like highlight anti-Semitism. They prefer term "radical populism," anyone half sense European history, parallels older, Jew-baiting politics longer dismissed. Economic dislocation rapid loss confidence traditional politics gave rise ultranationalist movements first half last century. Now global recession hunt someone blame jobs incomes disappear producing toxic politics. The Fidesz leader, Viktor Orban, youthful evangelist liberalized open markets 1990. Now strikes much nationalist tone. His Socialist opponents accept austerity IMF package. Unlike Greece—which helped, far, euro-zone partners—Hungary alone boom-time euro loans buy houses cars paid back ever-devaluing forint. Blaming Socialist government, globalization, international capital easy. But Fidesz went further. In bid votes far right, Fidesz parliamentarian, Oszkar Molnar, says it's time give "primacy Hungarian interests global capital, Jewish capital." Like Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front France, Jobbik support 15 percent Hungarian voters. The Czech right-wing ODS Party dismiss leader, former premier Mirek Topolanek, attacked Jewish origins current Czech prime minister castigated gay transport minister. In new book, The Populist Radical Right Poland, Oxford-educated Warsaw political professor Rafal Pankowski writes: "Antisemitism crucial Polish populist right. The number Jews Poland today minimal, anti-Jewish prejudice serves code general hostility diversity Polish [liberal] democracy." For time being, criticism nationalist politics suspended Poles mourn President Lech Kaczynski national leaders killed air-crash tragedy month. But record party activists—including Michal Kaminski, Poland's best-known M.E.P. leader small right- wing group Strasbourg Parliament—is disturbing. An admirer late Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, Kaminski uses ugly language gays, says apologize killing Jews Polish soil World War II "Jews apologize killing Poles." Mainstream political parties sought play rise minority bashing. But Fidesz affiliated center- right European People's Party, groups Angela Merkel's ruling Christian Democratic Union Party Germany, Nicolas Sarkozy's Union Popular Movement government France, ruling conservative parties Sweden, Italy, Belgium. When Austrian rightist Jorg Haider entered coalition Austria decade ago, European Union held Vienna political quarantine Haider removed. But Fidesz massive majority built attacking "Jewish capital" language even Haider didn't dare utter. So radical populism—anti-Muslim Western Europe, anti-Jewish Eastern Europe, anti-foreigner anti- immigrant rhetoric everywhere—is longer fringe politics. In Britain's general election, main parties seeking appease anti-foreigner feeling language immigrants would tolerate applied British citizens living working abroad. Comparisons prewar Europe overdrawn. Fascism dead coming back. But new politics intolerance afoot Europe, one knows deal it. http://www.newsweek.com/2010/09/05/how-marine-le-pen-is-changing-french-politics.print.html B6 Eit What Tea Party Looks Like Europe Marine Le Pen moving father's rabble-rousing, far-right party away fringe, redefining French politics process. Tracy McNicoll Christopher DickeySeptember 05, 2010 amuel Bollendorff / The New York Times-Redux Marine Le Pen heir apparent leadership National Front, right-wing party father Jean-Marie (left) leads today Jean-Marie Le Pen, 82-year-old firebrand France's far right—the man decades played inchoate fears, xenophobia, knee-jerk racism, ill-disguised anti-Semitism many supporters—had finished speaking faithful farm far English Channel. As members youth wing National Front party feasted barbecue apple pie, thrilled see grand old man hold forth, still "provocateur" taunting establishment, "toreador" hides sword cape lets press run like bull. Even youngsters knew, however, Jean-Marie's time ring nearing end. The old man made clear he's. determined step down. All eyes day daughter Marine. "She will, courage, temperament necessary, competence," Le Pen told reporters farmhouse. "It seems indisputable camp's best candidate 2012." Tall, blonde, plain-spoken, thick-skinned, Le Pen's youngest child, 42, heir apparent party. She's expected win contest leadership January, she's passionate advocate core message: strong French nationalism, relentless Euro-skepticism, lot hard-nosed talk fighting crime immigration. She's fresh face, new look, and, rising poll numbers placing third crowded field possible 2012 candidates, new threat French politics. In eyes many, she's effective—and thus dangerous—than father. It's measure Le Pens' enhanced power they've managed push President Nicolas Sarkozy right cast party mainstream. Over summer, Sarkozy essentially gave flirtation left, began election 2007. He cherry-picked popular Socialists centrist government, dividing party. But elections past March, Sarkozy's UMP party managed keep control one 22 regional governments. So decided swing back right playing fears public safety immigration. He proposed taking citizenship away criminals immigrant background launched campaign Roma (or "Gypsies"), booting hundreds country. While measures proved popular opinion polls, Sarkozy, ironically, not. His abysmal approval ratings remain low 30s. The younger Le Pen takes great pleasure watching Sarkozy squirm. "I think I get [his] nerves quite bit," says. "My profile much complicated deal father." The old man could painted creature past, purveyor old prejudices "sulfurous" reputation, says Marine. Today, however, Front wants bill "neither left right." If means losing fringe elements (many support Marine's rival, Bruno Gollnisch), well, "tent pis," says. Other right-wing movements Europe also pushing political mainstream. The government Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi Italy long relied alliance two groups used considered extreme—one former Fascist Party Gianfranco Fini, secessionist Northern League Umberto Bossi. A falling-out Berlusconi Fini left Bossi current kingmaker Italian politics. In Netherlands, militantly Islamophobic Geert Wilders won enough seats last elections become pivotal figure drawn-out process trying build new coalition government. Yet movements often differ significant ways right wing that's made U.S.A. Put aside usual caricature "people pointy hoods Ku Klux Klan," Marine Le Pen says, still believes "the American right much right National Front." She might agree want manage American frontiers effectively prevent massive illegal immigration, she's also big believer state's ability obligation help people. "We feel state means intervene," says. "We attached public services A la frangaise way limit inequalities among regions among French," including "access level health care." Le Pen grew household politics time, father object sometimes violent attacks competing factions right, well left. When Marine 8, someone set 20-kilo bomb family's Paris apartment building. Miraculously, one killed seriously injured, front building brought down. The crime never solved. "The worst part wasn't attack, single politician sent word condolence," says. "It difficult, builds character, hardens you." That's real asset political life anywhere. If Sarkozy finds facing Marine Le Pen presidential race year half now, may find wishing old man stayed around little longer. With Barbie Nadeau Rome
