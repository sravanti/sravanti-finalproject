Such mood seems spreading United States. It's surprising, really: Since attacks September 11, 2001, fear iniiecttcl "homeland" like drug penumbia official secrecy settled land way makes secrecy Cold War years (when country faced superpower, ragtag set offihadis, guerrillas, terrorists) seem like era sunshine. In atmosphere swirling fears hysteria amid declining living conditions, "explanations" times might remained confined tiny crews conspiracy-mongers suddenly gain patina plausibility traction. No wonder that, hard times hit, financial system seemed verge collapse, unemployment soared massive wave home foreclosures swept view, increasing numbers Americans became prey wacky explanation troubles, none idea Islam somehow responsible, mosques Islamic centers meant sliver minority capable imposing anything, less way life country, Sharia law (of things) might somehow worm way state teal systems, YouTube hotbed of.terrorism worthy suppression, or... well, name it. Max Blumenthal, author bestselling book Reptblican Gomorrah: Inside Movement Thai Shattered Party, done necessary legwork to"take us deep one crews conspiracy- mongers who, another time, one would paid much attention to, twenty-first-century America gained remarkable audience. They chilling barometer changing weather America. Torn The Great Islamophobic Crusade Inside Bizarre Cabal Secretive Donors, Demagogic Bloggers, Pseudo- Scholars, European Neo-Fascists, Violent Israeli Settlers, Republican Presidential Hopefuls Behind Crusade By Max Blumenthal Nine years 9/11, hysteria Muslims American life gripped country. With Gone outburst arson attacks mosques, campaigns stop construction, branding Muslim- American community, overwhelmingly moderate, hotbed potential terrorist recruits. The frenzy raged rural Tennessee New York City, Oklahoma, voters even overwhelmingly Approved ballot measure banning implementation Sharia law American courts (not prospect existed). This campaign islamophobia wounded President Oba.ma politically, one five Americans bought sustained chorus false rumors secret Muslim faith. And may tainted views Muslims general; August 2010 Pew Research Center poll revealed that, among Americans, favorability rating Muslims dropped 11 points since 2005. Erupting many years September 11th trauma, spasm anti-Muslim bigotry might seem oddly timed unexpectedly spontaneous. But think again: it's fruit organized, long-term campaign tight confederation right-Wing activists operatives first focused Isia.mophobia soon September 11th attacks, attained critical mass Obama era. It embittered conservative forces, voted power 2008, sought remarkable success leverage cultural resentment political partisan gain. This network obsessively fixated supposed spread Muslim influence America. Its apparatus spans continents, extending Tea Party activists European far right. It brings together common cause right-wing ultra- Zionists, Christian evangelicals, racist British soccer hooligans. It reflects aggressively pro- Israel sensibility, key figures venerating Jewish state Middle Eastern Fort Apache front lines Global War Terror urging U.S. various European powers emulate heavy-handed methods. Little recent American Jslamophobia (with a.strong emphasis "phobia") sheer happenstance. Years Tea Party shock troops massed angry protests outside proposed site Islamic community center lower Manhattan, representatives Israel lobby Jewish-American establishment launched campaign pro- Palestinian campus activism would prove seedbed everything come. That campaign quickly -- perhaps predictably -- morphed series crusades mosques islarilic schools which, turn, attracted assortment shady exceptionally energetic militants network's ranks. Besides providing initial energy islamophobic crusade, conservative elements within pro-Israel lobby bankrolled network's apparatus, enabling influence national debate. One philanthropist particular provided beneficence propel campaign ahead. He little-known Los Angeles- area software security entrepreneur named Aubrey Chernick, operates security consulting firm blandly named National Center Crisis Continuity Coordination. A former trustee Washington Institute Near East Policy, served think tank American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), frontline lobbying group Israel, Chernick said worth $750 million. Chemick's fortune puny compared billionaire Koch Brothers, extraction industry titans fund Tea Party-related groups like Americans Prosperity, dwarfed financial empire Haim Saban, Israeli- American media baron one largest.-orivate donors Democratic party recently matched $9 million raised Friends Israeli Defense Forces single night. However, injecting money small influential constellation groups individuals narrow agenda. Chernick considerable impact. Through Fairtmook Foundation, private entity wife Joyce control, Chernick provided funding groups ranging Anti- Defamation League (ADL) CAMERA, right- wing, pro-Israel, media- watchdog outfit, violent Israeli settlers living Palestinian lands figures like pseudo-academic author Robert Spencer, largely responsible popularizing conspiracy theories coming conquest West Muslim fanatics seeking establish worldwide caliphate. Together, groups spread hysteria Muslims Middle American communities immigrants Middle East recently settled, watched glee likely Republican presidential frontrunners Mike Huckabee Sarah Palin pmmoted cause oarpe.ki tropes. Perhaps thing surprising increasingly widespread appeal islamophobia that, years ago, phenomenon confined college campuses inner city neighborhood, seemed like fleeting fad would soon pass American political landscape. Birth Network The fslamophobic crusade launched earnest peak George W. Bush's prestige neoconservatives allies riding high. In 2003, three years collapse President Bill Clinton's attempt resolve Israeli-Palestinian issue immediate wake invasion Iraq, network Jewish groups, ranging ADL the. American Jewish Committee AIPAC, gathered address saw sudden rise pro-Palestinian activism college campuses nationwide. That meeting gave birth David Project, campus advocacy group led Charles Peters, co-founded CAMERA, one many outfits bankrolled Chernick. With help public relations professionals,. Peters ci plan "take back campus influencing public opinion lectures. Internet, coalitions," memo produced time consulting firm McKinsey Company stated. In 2004, conferring Martin Kramer, fellow Washington Institute Near East Policy, pro-Israel think tank Where Chernoff served trustee, Peters produced documentary film called Columbia "rbecornint., It -filled claims Jewish students Columbia University claiming endured intimidation insults Arab professors. The film portrayed New York City school's Department Middle East Asian Languages Cultures hothouse anti-Semitism. In complaints, students focused one figure particular: Joseph .vlassa.d, Palestinian professor Middle East studies. He known passionate advocacy formation binational state Israel Palestine, well strident criticism termed "the racist character Israel." The film identified "one dangerous intellectuals campus," featured crucial villain The Professors: The 101 Most Dangerous Academics America, book (Chemick-•funded) neoconservative activist David Horowitz. As Massad seeking tenure time, especially vulnerable sort wholesale assault. When controversy Massad's views intensified, Congressman Anthony Weiner, liberal New York Democrat pqee :lescri representative "the ZOA [Zionist Organization America] wing Democratic Party," demanded Columbia President Lee Bollinger, renowned First Amendment scholar, fire professor. Bollinger responded issuing uncharacteristically defensive statements "limited" nature academic freedom. In end, however, none charges stuck. Indeed, testimonies David Project film eventually either discredited never corroborated. In 2009, Massad earned tenure winning Columbia's prestigious Lionel Trilling Award excellence scholarship. Having demonstrated ability intimidate faculty members even powerful university administrators, however, Kramer claimed moral victory name project, boasting press "this turning point." While David Project subsequently fostered chapters campuses nationwide, director set different path -- initially, streets Boston 2004 oppose construction Islamic Society Boston Cultural Center. For nearly 15 years, Islamic Society Boston sought build center heart Roxbury, city's largest black neighborhood, serve sizable Muslim population. With endorsements Mayor Thomas Menino leading Massachusetts lawmakers, mosque's construction seemed like fait accompli - - until, is, Rupert Murdoch-owned Boston Herald local Fox News affiliate snapped action. Boston Globe columnist Jeff Jacoby also chimed series reports claiming center's plans evidence Saudi Arabian plot bolster influence radical Islam United States, possibly even train underground terror cells. It point David Project entered fray, convening elements local pro-Israel community Boston area seek strategies torpedo project. According emqiis obtained Islamic Society's lawyers lawsuit David Project, organizers settled campaign years nuisance lawsuits, along accusations center received foreign finding "the Wahhabi movement Saudi Arabia or... Moslem Brotherhood." In response, grassroots coalition liberal Jews initiat4d inter-faith efforts aimed ending controversy essentially manufactured thin air corroding relations Jewish Muslim communities city. Peters would not, however, relent. 'We concerned ever Saudi influence local mosques," ,apounced suburban Boston synagogue 2007. After paying millions dollars legal bills enduring countless smears, Islamic Society Boston completed construction community center 2008. Meanwhile, surprisingly, nothing came David Project's dark warnings. As Boston-area National Public Radio reporter Philip Martin reflected September 2010, "The horror stories preceded [the center's] development seem shrill histrionic retrospect." The Network Expands This second failed campaign was, end, movement building success, less national security. The local crusade established effective blueprint generating hysteria establishment Islamic centers mosques across country, galvanizing cast characters would form anti-Muslim network would gain attention success years come. In 2007, figures coalesced proto- movement launched new crusade, time targeting. Khalil Gibran International Academy, secular Arabic-English elementary school Brooklyn, New York. Calling ad hoc pressure group, Stop Madrassah madrassah simply Arab word "school" - - coalition's activists included array previously unknown zealots made attempt disguise extreme views came Islam religion, well Muslims America. Their stated goal challenge school's establishment basis violation church-state separation U.S. Constitution. The true aim coalition, however, transparent: pressure city's leadership adopt antagonistic posture towards local Muslim community. The activists zeroed school's principal, Debbie Almontaser, veteran educator Yemeni descent, baselessly .branded "a jihadist" well 9/11 denier. They also accused of-- Pamela Geller, far-right blogger gaining prominence put it, "whitewash[ing] genocide Jews." Daniel Pipes, neoconservative academic previously active campaigns Joseph Massad Boston Islamic center (and whose pro-Likud think tank, Middle East .Forum, received $150,000 Chernick) Jamed school go ahead "Arabic-language instruction inevitably laden Pan-Arabist Islamist baggage." As campaign reached fever pitch, Almontaser reported members coalition actually stallsinQ wherever went. Given Columbia Journalism School professor former New York Times reporter Samuel Freedman called "her clear, public record interfaith activism outreach," including work New York Police Department Anti-Defamation League September 11th attacks, assault .Almontaser seemed little short bizarre -- assailants discovered photograph T-shirt produced AWAAM, local Arab feminist organization, read "Intifada NYC." As turned out, AWAAM sometimes shared office space Yemeni- American association Almontaser served board member. Though connection seemed like stretch, promoted line attack Stop Madrassah coalition seeking. Having found way wedge emotional issue Israel-Palestine conflict a. previously New York-centered campaign, school's opponents next gained platform Murdoch- owned New York Post, reporters Chuck Bennett Jana Winter claimed T-shirt "apparently call Gaza-style uprising Big Apple." While Almontaser attempted explain Post's reporters rejected terrorism„ Anti- Defamation League chimed. cue. ADL spokesman Oren Segal told Post: "The T-shirt reflection movement increasingly lauds violence Israelis instead rejecting it. That disturbing." Before Qassam rockets could launched Almontaser's school, former ally New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg caved growing pressure threatened shut school, prompting resign. A Jewish principal spoke Arabic replaced Almontaser, later filed lawsuit city breaching free speech rights. In 2010, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ui New York's Department Education "succumbed bias creation school intended dispel" firing Almontaser urged pay $300,000 damages. The commission also concluded Post quoted misleadingly. Though failed stop establishment Khalil Gibran Academy,•the burg:eoning anti-M sliin movement succeeded forcing city leaders bend will, learned that, moved search high-profile targets. As ,New York Times s!..t_..at time, "The fight school... early skirmish broader, national struggle." battle really begun." Pipes told Times. From Scam Publicity Coup Pipes couldn't mark. In late 2009, Isiamophobes sprang action Cordoba Initiative, non-profit Muslim group headed Feisai Abdul Rauf, exceedingly moderate Sufi Muslim imam regularly lepic,,etiting United States behest State Department, announced going build community center downtown New "NCork City. With help investors, Raufs Cordoba Initiative purchased space two blocks Ground Zero Manhattan. The space contain prayer area part large community center would open everyone neighborhood. None facts mattered Pamela Geller. Thanks constant prodding Nog, Atlas Shrugged. Geller made Cordoba's construction plans national issue, provokino fervent calls faml conservatives protect "hallowed ground" 9/11 creeping Sharia. (That "mosque" would sight Ground Zero neighborhood was, fact. everything strip clubs fast-food joints didn't matter.) Geller's activism Cordoba House earned 52-year-old full- time blogger attention apparently craved., including • 1 Neu, York ThIleS frequent cable news spots, esoeciallv, course, Fox News. Mainstream reporters tended focus Geller's bizarre stunts. She posted video string bikini Fort Lauderdale beach, instance, ranting "left-tards" "Nazi Hezbollah." Her gall boycotting Campbell's Soup company offered halal -- approved Islamic law (as kosher food Jewish law) -- versions products got much attention, .cron-lotior screed claiming President Barack Obama illegitimate lovechild Malcolm X. Geller never earned living journalist. She supported millions dollars divorce settlement life insurance money ex-husband. He died 2008, year alleged $1.3 million scam accused of-running car dealership co-owned Geller. Independently wealthy time hands, Geller proved able indeed came exploiting strange media stardom in.cite already organized political network islamophobes intensify crusade. She also benefited close alliances leading islamophobes Europe. Among Ocher's allies Andrew Gravers, Danish activist formed group Stop Islamicization Europe, :.1a.-ye unusually blunt motto: "Racism lowest form human stupidity, Islamophobia height common sense." Gravers' group inspired Geller's U.S.- based outfit, Stop Islamicization America, formed friend Robert Spencer, pseudo-scholar whose bestselling books, including The Truth About Muhammad, Founder World's Most Intolerant Religion, prompted former advisor President Richard Nixon Muslim activist Robert Crane ca/1 "the principal leader... new academic .field Muslim bashing." (According website almost $1 million donations Chernick steered Spencer's Jihad Watch group David Horowitz's Freedom Center.) Perfect sources Republican political figures search next hot- button cause, rhetoric found way talking points Newt Gingrich Sarah Patin propelled crusade Cordoba House national spotlight. Gingrich soon pared community center Nazi sign next Holocaust Memorial Museum, Patin called "a stab heart" "the Heartland." Meanwhile, Tea Party candidates like Republican Ilario Pantano, Iraq war veteran killed two unarmed Iraqi civilians, shooting 60 times -- even stopped reload made opppsition Cordoba House centerpiece midterm congressional campaigns conducted hundreds miles Ground Zero. Geller's campaign "the mosque Ground Zero" gained unexpected assist veneer legitimacy established Jewish leaders like Anti- Defamation League National Director Abraham Foxman. "Survivors Holocaust entitled feelings irrational," et.:narked New York Times. Comparing bereaved family members 9-1 1 victims Holocaust survivors, Foxman insisted, "Their anguish entitles positions others would categorize irrational bigoted." Soon enough, David Harris, director (Chernick- funded) American Jewish Committee, demanding Cordoba's leaders compelled reveal "true attitudes" Palestinian militant groups construction center initiated. Rabbi Marvin Hier Simon Wiesenthal Center Los Angeles, another major Jewish group, insisted would "insensitive" Cordoba build near "a cemetery," though organization recently granted permission municipality Jerusalem build "museum tolerance" called The Center Human Dignity directly top Mamilla Cemetery, Muslim Graveyard contained thousands grave sites dating back 1,200 years. Inspiration Israel It evident involvement figures like Gravers Islamophobic network United States represented trans-Atlantic expansion simmering resentment Europe. There, far-right storming victories parliamentary elections across continent part appealing simmering anti-Muslim sentiments voters rural working-class communities. The extent collaboration European American Islamophobes continued grow Geller, Spencer, even Gingrich standing beside Europe's prominent anti-Muslim figure, Dutch pad iamentarian Geed Wilders, rally Cordoba House. In meantime. Geller issuing statements sunport Emdish Defense League, band uoorlstruc[ed riec)-Nazis former members whites-only British National Party intimidate Muslims streets cities like Birmingham London. In addition, trans- Atlantic Islamophobic crusade stretched Israel, country come symbolize network's fight Muslim menace. As Geller told New York Times' Alan Feuer, Israel "a good guide because, like I said, war civilized man savage, side civilized man." EDL members regularly wave Israeli flags rallies, Wilders claims formed views Muslims time worked Israeli cooperative farm 1980s. He has, says, visited country 40 times since meet rightist political allies like Aryeh Eldad, member Israeli Knesset leader far right Hatikvah faction National Union Party. He called forcibly "transferring" Palestinians living Israel occupied West Bank Jordan Egypt. On December 5th, example, Wilders traveled Israel 'ffrjend nieei,imr, Foreign Minister Avi2clor Lieberman, declared press conference Israel annex West Bank set Palestinian state Jordan. In apocalyptic clash civilizations global anti- Muslim network sought incite, tiny armed Jewish settlements like Yitzar, located hills occupied Palestinian city Nablus, represent front- line fortresses. Inside Yitzar's state-funded yeshiva, rabbi named Yitzhak Shapira instructed students rules must applied considering killing non- Jews. Shapira summarized opinions widely publicized book. Torat HaMelech, The King's Torah. Claiming non- Jews "uncompassionate nature," Shapira cited rabbinical texts declare gentiles could killed order "curb evil inclinations." "There justification," rabbi proclaimed, "for killing babies clear grow harm us, and, situation they' may harmed deliberately, combat adults." In 2006, rabbi briefly held Israeli police urging supporters murder Palestinians age 13. Two years later, according Israeli newspaper Ilaaretz, rabbinical letter support Israeli Jews brutally assaulted two Arab youths country's Holocaust Remembrance Day. That year, Shapira arrested suspect helping rocket attack Palestinian village near Nablus. Though charged, name came connection another act terror when, January 2010, Israeli police raided settlement seeking vandals set fire nearby mosque. One Shapira's followers, American immigrant, Jack _Mite", confessed murdering two innocent Palestinians attempting kill liberal Israeli historian Ze'ev Sternhell mail bomb. What Islamophobic campaigns United States? A great deal, actually. Through New York-based tax-exempt non- profits like Central Fund Israel Ateret Cohenim, instance, omnipresent Aubrey Chernick sent tens thousands dollars support Yitzar settlement, well messianic settlers dedicated "Judaizing" East Jerusalem. The settlement movement's leading online news magazine. Arutz Sheva, feattired Geller columnist. A friend Geller's, Beth Gili.nsky, right-wing activist group called Coalition Honor Ground Zero founder Jewish Action Alliance (apparently ttun. Manhattan real estate office), organized large rally New York City April 2010 protest Obama administration's call settlement freeze. Among Chemick's major funding recipients supposedly "apolitical" group called Aish. Hatorah claims educate Jews heritage. Based New York active fever swamps northern West Bank settlements near Yitzar, Aish Hatorah shares address staff shadowy foreign non-profit called Clarion Fund. During 2008 U.S. election campaign, Clarion Fund distributed 28 million DVDs propaganda film called Obsession newspaper inserts residents swing states around country. The film featured who's anti-Muslim activists, including \Valid Shoebat, self-proclaimed "former PLO terrorist." Among Shoebat's striking statements: "A secular dogma like Nazism less dangerous Islamofascism today." At Christian gathering 2007, "former Islamic terrorist" told crowd Islam "satanic cult" born evangelical Christian. In 2008, however, Jerusalem Post, right- leaning newspaper, exposed h rn fraud, whose claims terrorism fictional. Islamophobic groups registered minimal impact 2008 election campaign. Two years later, however, Republicans regained control House Representatives midterm elections, network appears reached. critical mass. Of course, deciding factor election economy, two years, Americans likely vote pocketbooks again. But construction single Islamic community center imaginary threat Sharia law issues reflected influence small band locally oriented activists, suggested certain presidential candidate already demonized crypto- Muslim runs reelection, country's vocal Islamophobes could find national platform amid frenzied atmosphere campaign. By now, Islamophobic crusade gone beyond right-wing pro-Israel activists, cyber-bigots, ambitious hucksters conceived it. It belongs leading Republican presidential candidates, top- rated cable news hosts, crowds Tea Party activists. As fervor spreads, crusaders basking glory accomplished.
