How Come havent? This against. Betrayed They said save Afghanistan's women. So come haven't? BY VALERIE M. HUDSON, PATRICIA LEIDL I MAY 10, 2010 One day November 2009, Helmand province's capital Lashkar Gah, group Afghan widows divorcees met Patricia, commissioned write series success stories U.S. Agency International Development (USAID). All women 20s, 30s, 40s looked 60s. Until recently, none could work possessed marketable skills, could neither read write, risk killed left homes. A number women said that, program -- focused tailoring basic literacy -- children used weep night hunger. COMMENTS (22) SHARE: Twitter Reddit Buzz EMore... As Patricia prepared leave, women fluttered around like moths, touching sleeves speaking once. 'What saying?" Pat asked young Pashto-speaking interpreter. "They telling go back country ask people abandon them. The women Afghanistan don't want leave. They quite literally die Taliban return," said. In recent question-and-answer period one universities, Brigham Young, student asked Gen. David Petraeus whether anyone thought ask women Afghanistan felt U.S. hopes incorporate "reformed" Taliban governance structures Americans leave. Carefully avoiding word "women," general assured questioning student "moderate" Taliban would eligible rehabilitation. Left unaddressed definition "moderate," clearly depends sit: If sit burqa, thing "moderate" Taliban. Petraeus might find easy sidestep question happen Afghanistan's women "moderate" Taliban come back, it's likely haunt long time. Without security women security -- we've done protect it, moral practical obligation stay Afghanistan. In 2001, George W. Bush's administration interpreted first post-invasion photos Afghan girls heading school Afghan women unveiling faces tangible evidence conditions improving benighted land. A months invasion, 2002 State Union address, Bush announced, "The last time met chamber, mothers daughters Afghanistan captives homes, forbidden working going school. Today women free part Afghanistan's new government." The Americans strong-armed handful women loya jirga drafted Afghan Constitution. They strong-armed quota women Afghan national legislature -- something even American women treated to. U.S. troops built schools girls pushed women included local shuras, USAID ripped page Greg Mortenson's Three Cups Tea facilitated new training educational opportunities women. But current administration, despite female secretary State new Office Global Women's Issues, appears ditching women Afghanistan like blind date gone bad. You go back 10 months find sustained rhetoric President Barack Obama importance assuring security women Afghanistan. Since then, especially since last year's Afghan election, fine words sitting president disappeared. Many fine actions gone, too. Push local shuras including women 2002? Yes. Push local shuras including women 2010? Forget it. It's difficult understand why. Afghanistan crisis. The cynical policies characterized early mid-stages occupation come home roost. President Hamid Karzai rogue's gallery kleptocrats, human rights abusers, drug lords hanging onto power even Karzai declares open season United Nations accusing senior bureaucrats organizing widespread voter fraud consolidated hold power. In meantime, women taken back seat realpolitik exigencies coalition exit strategy. But suffering real, Afghanistan's poverty chaos affect women possibly all. Matemal mortality Afghanistan still makes world's top three list, nine years U.S. invasion, resulting life expectancy women 46. In countryside, Taliban zealots spray acid girls' faces going school -- 27 percent first place. According recent survey U.N. Development Fund Women, 87 percent Afghan women report beaten regular basis. In July last year, U.N. Assistance Mission Afghanistan (UNAMA) issued report represents stinging official condemnation Karzai administration's abysmal track record women date. The report concluded, "The current reality ... women denied fundamental human rights risk violence course seeking justice crimes perpetrated them." Last year Karzai pardoned well-connected political thugs -- witnesses -- gang-raped woman bayonet. Her husband, battled redress, assassinated soon thereafter. Women dare speak widespread trampling rights face almost certain death murderers face 100 percent impunity. For warlords mujahideen make upper echelons Karzai government, issue gender equality always unwanted appendage U.S. involvement -- one could easily dispensed deployment flowery speeches token appointment lone female minister Ministry Women's Affairs. Indeed, recent "election," Karzai felt secure enough sign law series repressive measures designed repeal minimal gains women made since Taliban ouster. Although eventually forced back legislation allows Shiite husbands rape wives, Karzai successfully signed law legislation denies severely limits women's rights inherit, divorce, guardianship children. The Shiite Personal Status Law also legalizes forced marriage rape minors. It allows men exert almost total control female relatives offers power prohibit women's access work, education, health care denying right leave homes except "legitimate" purposes. Even Karzai's wife -- doctor whose skills desperately needed -- strictly sequestered. And sounds bad, wait Americans leave. This women. Gender inequality affects girls women, boys men. In Afghanistan, women rarely able leave house, young boys often forced carry unwarranted amount financial responsibility, something limits prospects well. Nor even Afghanistan. As Secretary State Hillary Clinton said March, "The subjugation women threat national security United States." On geopolitical level, Valerie's research found states higher levels violence women also less peaceful internationally. Indeed, violence women better predictor bellicosity level democracy, level wealth, presence Islamic civilization. In 2010 study, Valerie, along Brad Thayer, also found high levels gender inequality strong aggravating factor development Islamic suicide terrorism. So, given desperate need Afghanistan's women serious consequences worldwide, aren't help? One reason fallacious notion, common among coalition members, Afghan "culture" allow gender equality forcing issue undermine Western interests. Pat heard openly one coalition representative, prefers remain anonymous: 'There point pushing gender equality. It alienate [Afghans]." Of course, "them" refers men. But decision-makers forget culture fixed, highly mutable dynamic. More 30 years ago, Afghan women attending universities, teaching, working doctors, nurses, professors. Far black hole gender apartheid, Afghanistan, though impoverished, progressive many Muslim neighbors. Furthermore, many young Afghans open new ways things. In 2009, hundreds Afghan men women bravely stood together Kabul protest Karzai's support new oppressive Shiite family law. If Americans assume Afghan men Neanderthals incapable sympathizing plight sisters, wrong. Another, unmentionable reason may chauvinism permeates Western military culture. U.S. military life, despite increasing female recruitment even "female engagement teams," remains bastion masculinity, little sensitivity toward questions female rights. For military leadership recruits alike, immured almost exclusively male world, complete absence women Afghanistan's streets villages elicited comment Marines surrounded Pat, though woman noticed immediately. And ready availability pornography U.S. bases, coupled seamier depictions life West, damages prospects gender equality extension, Western interests. As one young, well-educated 24-year-old Afghan male pointed out, "Your culture respect women all. Look pornography way exploit women ways can't even imagine. Do call progress?" Added another Afghan USAID programmer working Gardez, man 50s father three girls, "It would better coalition could figure way limit kind material." We better -- much better. The Obama administration must instill military personnel senior diplomats necessity fully protecting women's rights. Key educating gender equality furthers Western interests security. The military spend less time courting "moderate" Taliban time showing Afghan community leaders gender equality -- including female access family planning methods -- result healthier families, lower maternal child death rates, poverty alleviation, greater self-determination. Gender included component governance training placed front center upcoming "peace jirga" include Taliban. Indeed, let half negotiating team representing government coalition female: yes, full 50 percent. Women must also represented government. As Melanne Verveer, U.S. ambassador large global women's issues, noted last summer, speaking female politicians Afghanistan, "There one minister cabinet, powerless. There low percentage women civil service. There one female governor, Bamiyan." Obama must insist important changes women leave make subsequent aid contingent upon maintenance strong presence women Afghan government. Better yet, coalition needs support "regime change" building democratic institutions groom moderate, educated middle class young women men eventually take over. Over two-thirds Afghan population age 25, either real opportunity social change -- educated given chance shape society progressive way -- major obstacle, find without jobs, unable marry, burdened retrograde attitudes means male female. We must hold Afghanistan responsible treaty obligations U.N. Convention Elimination Discrimination Women (CEDAVV) U.N. Security Council Resolution 1325 women, peace, security. Afghanistan signed CEDAW without reservations (the United States interestingly, not), means committed passing whatever legislation necessary implement wide-ranging principles gender equality enshrined treaty. This includes taking measures ensure women enjoy basic human rights fundamental freedoms men, place legal judicial procedures protect rights women, taking measures eliminate sexist discrimination, lastly, submitting national reports every four years U.N. advisory group international experts, CEDAW Committee, ensure transparency measures country taken implement treaty's provisions. Unanimously adopted 2000, UNSC 1325 marked first time Security Council recognized disproportionate unique impact armed conflict women stressed importance equal full participation active agents peace security. Needless say, women currently enjoy fundamental freedoms men, indeed, passing Shiite family law, many worse before. To change this, coalition needs stay Afghanistan. Withdrawing critical juncture would doom Afghanistan entire region instability effectively consign one half population premature death existence fit animals. We creating shameful American tradition leaving women better (Afghanistan) -- even much worse (Iraq) -- U.S. troops intervened. On basis America's track record, women around world faith U.S. soldiers improve security. Despite Clinton's remarks link gender equality security, ground Americans act women's well-being, end, peripherally related issue peace. As seen, view could wrong. Verveer's benchmarks concerning Afghanistan right ones: "Progress Afghanistan must measured military terms, also terms social, political, economic participation women rebuilding Afghanistan safeguarding human rights." American women right ask sending sons daughters fight die Afghan women continue treated like inferior subspecies humanity. When break faith Afghan women, break faith American women. You also break faith reasons first place. Save bio subscribe FP. Majid Saeedi/Getty Image
