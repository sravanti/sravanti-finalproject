The direct negotiations Israel Palestinians preconditions - dictated Israel. By At.tiye Elder: Tags: Israel news M:ddist East peace Two years ago, basketball tournament held Tel Aviv University participation student teams 14 cOuntries, including Palestinian team occupied territories. The games purportedly held "without preconditions," every team put best players court aimed win. But unsurprisingly, Shin Ben security service permitted seven Palestinian players, including bench players, enter Israel. Some key players team compelled stay home. After several losses (by 30 40 points), Palestinians turn face team one Israeli colleges, coach announced decided spare players another humiliation, requested game canceled. The illuminating movie "Friendship Games," shown tonight Yes Docu channel (directed Ram Levy, along Ibtisam IVIara'ana, Duki Dror Yoav Shamir), documents tournament, initiative Ed Peskowitz, American Jew co-owner Atlanta Hawks basketball team NBA. The camera follows Israeli coach Palestinian locker room. After long while, tells players order even teams, two join side. He tells two Israeli bench players, including one known Fats(); shirts Palestinian team. The game ends decisive victory Israeli team strong sense missed opportunity.. The direct negotiations Israel Palestinians, like basketball game, preconditions. Not conditions demanded Palestinians, conditions dictated Israel. The refusal freeze Israeli building East Jerusalem precondition, like demand freeze it. The refusal resume negotiations point talks previous prime minister, Ehud Olmert, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas left Annapolis conference less precondition demand resume talks square one. The head referee, president United States, twisted arms colleagues Quartet dragging Abbas Washington. Barack °barna decided negotiations held without commitment regarding building East Jerusalem, opened without even declaration principles stating talks held basis general formula, like peace security Israel state along 1967 borders Palestinians. It's time jump fountain Rabin Square cheer: The Palestinians shafted! If Benjamin Netanyahu's aim play around much possible ball, sometimes kick opponent, really chalk another victory. But Israel's success negotiations, like success student team tournament, measured terms "victory" "defeat." What victory weak Palestinian team worth, won friendly games ended virtually interaction participants? What political process Palestinians worth erodes Abbas' standing leads nowhere? What gain humiliating partner constituency way negotiating table? If Israel's approach every one core issues winning everything, there's point bothering many VIPs another unnecessary summit. Let's assume we'll succeed, help Jewish power around Obama, twist Abbas' arm extract, example, agreement concedes sovereignty Temple Mount. How many hours would agreement last? All need "victories" like invitation launch direct negotiations, "without preconditions," we'll lose last partners settlement prevent Israel turning apartheid state Palestinian state (the binational model nightmare, far I'm concerned). What Abbas announces he's enough losing purportedly friendly games, he's decided time come step down? Will declare another victory invite Hamas leader Khaled Meshal Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad party?
