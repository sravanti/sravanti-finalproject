By Sarah Chayes November 15, 2012 The scandal enveloping members America's adulated top brass deepest crisis hit military decades. It crisis President Obama need — shaming country increasing burden major transition national security team. And yet, crisis great corrective. Obama use one reverse one dysfunctional elements U.S. foreign policy last decade: infatuation military solutions problems fundamentally political. The resignation former Central Intelligence Agency Director David H. Petraeus extramarital affair came light, together expected high-level personnel changes State Department agencies, creates singular opportunity embark complex process rebalancing U.S. foreign policy favor non-military approaches. When first came office, Obama seemed suspicious Petraeus, made reputation President George W. Bush general transformed military's approach Iraq war. The suspicion reflected fraught National Security Council debate Afghanistan strategy 2009. Yet since then, Obama, like many others, seems seduced Petraeus. Not man man could offer him. Petraeuss unique political genius last decade provide two contrasting presidents military solution key national security problems tailored character. For Bush, obsessed Iraq leaving mark Middle East, Petraeus helped design grandiose, troop-heavy approach. With change administrations, Petraeus soon saw Obama team different — concerned costs inherited wars risks runaway military. So Petraeus continued pay lip-service counterinsurgency doctrine, veered away practice.

But approach, though cheaper resources American lives, still flawed. It still military answer problems deeply political nature rooted complex mix history, regional cultural particularism, effects protracted abuse power elites. By shifting drones special ops instruments choice combat militant extremism, U.S. government remains consumed old questions: How many men women uniform, equipped kind hardware, need employ tactics defeat enemy? What atrophied years two U.S. administrations dwelt obsessively questions tools U.S. foreign policy, including information-gathering analysis, diplomacy economic legal leverage. Perhaps gravest consequence knowledge deficit. Both wars hampered devastating lack situational understanding. In Afghanistan, I lived worked eight years, I stunned long took U.S. officials realize tribes key Afghan social structure. U.S. officials resisted meeting ordinary Afghans, dealing instead members self-serving unpopular government. So, decade, U.S. government operating almost blind. The first way Obama constructively harness Petraeus downfall reorient CIA toward core function: intelligence-gathering. Of late, body-count culture prevailed CIA, exemplified secretive drone campaign. If 60 intelligence professionals assigned planning monitoring drone air, reported, that's 60 ground country, interacting locals, gaining intuitive feel dynamics. Obama resist temptation put another target-focused operator helm CIA. Another main civilian component U.S. power diplomacy. Obama also use moment transition think kind State Department really needs. The instruments U.S. foreign policy multiple, varied subtle application. To avail them, government needs smart, adaptable, dynamic risk-takers, think strategically operate autonomy. Such people must attracted government service provided responsibilities commensurate talents. But national security topic moment threatens push Obama wrong direction. The death Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens Benghazi, Libya, politicized deeply counterproductive ways. Members Congress bear mind continue examining details attack. Stevens exactly type diplomat U.S. government needs: someone long experience region posted, ambassador engaged people, gained insight environment helped influence it. That kind diplomacy essential, carries risks. If becomes politically untenable Washington ambassador die line duty, talented diplomats hobbled. And faced choked career path, best look elsewhere rewarding work. Obama appoint secretary State determined counteract tendency retrench. Perhaps important foreign policy challenge Obama faces second term expand, restructure reinforce range civilian instruments U.S. power. That generational task, one current crisis provided unparalleled opportunity tackle. Sarah Chayes, former special assistant chairman Joint Chiefs.
