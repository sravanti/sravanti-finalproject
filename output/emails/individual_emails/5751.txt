Things aren't bad seem. It took little bit figure out, turns O'Reilly didn't new show last night - place re-aired show May 17th, original night Posner got beat up. I guess O'Reilly taking 4-day weekend, don't ask picked show air place. So watching repeat: http://www.billoreilly.com/show?action=viewTVShow&showID=2612
