Diplomacy Before After Conflict By Marc Grossman Conflict universal condition,' older diplomacy. While conflict constant human history, nature armed conflict, especially nature 21st-century warfare, transformed. General Rupert Smith identified changes book The Utility Force: "The ends fight changing; fight amongst people; conflicts tend timeless; fight lose force; occasion new uses found old weapons; sides mostly non-state."2 The nature 21st-century diplomacy also changing. To successful, diplomats must simultaneously shape, act upon, react global challenges. As Hans Binnendijk Richard Kugler National Defense University argue, single problem, danger, threat holds key world's future. What matters interaction simultaneity responses.3 The definition victory, too, different today. Twenty-first-century national security success encompass comprehensive definition security, achieved broadest simultaneous application elements national power. This key understanding Philip Bobbitt's concept "preclusive victory," describes "anticipatory, precautionary attention possible futures," requiring expansive integrated approach modern diplomacy, defense, development. A diplomatic strategy designed produce preclusive victory include conflict prevention, successful negotiation, deterrence, preparation conflict else fail, efforts establish order, ensure stability, promote political economic pluralism conflict. Diplomats always participants prevention management conflict aftermath. The conflict prevention side diplomacy occupied much time State Department 1993 1997 Department's Executive Secretary U.S. Ambassador Turkey. Postconflict diplomacy defining issue last third career State Assistant Secretary State European Affairs Under Secretary State Political Affairs 2001 2005. I tried draw upon experiences observations discuss scope complexity modern diplomacy, methods goals needed prevent conflict, diplomacy's role conflict seems unavoidable, contribution diplomacy make restoring stability following conflict. Diplomacy Conflict Prevention Thanks efforts scholars practitioners, make better use methods theory conflict prevention. The United States Institute Peace Woodrow Wilson International Center Scholars two among many institutions taken leadership role efforts. Michael Lund, practitionerscholar, notes present uncoordinated patchy nature preventive diplomacy reflects absence accepted international conflict prevention regime system governance—that is, agreed upon arrangements geographic jurisdictions allocated, functional responsibilities assigned, norms procedures formulated, actors held accountable responsibilities.' He asks crucial question seek "coordinate rationalize" system preventive diplomacy: responsibility tasks preventive action located—early warning, decision act, formulation response, provision bureaucratic political support? Should horizontal, across different organizations actors, vertical, chains command?6 An example conflict prevention meets Lund's tests effort undertaken North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), close collaboration European Union (EU) Organisation Security Co-operation Europe, supported United States, avoid civil war Macedonia 2001. It difficult recall that, September 11, 2001, possibility civil war Macedonia leading international headline. This successful campaign conflict prevention defined remarkable personal institutional cooperation NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson EU High Representative Common Foreign Security Policy (and former NATO Secretary General) Javier Solana. I spoke often period Lord Robertson, Solana, Ambassador James Pardew, President George W. Bush Secretary Colin Powell appointed U.S. representative effort who, along Francois Leotard, EU Special Envoy, played crucial role negotiating implementing Ohrid Framework Agreement. As direct participant, senior NATO official Mark Laity stated insights modern diplomacy conflict prevention drawn effort, including need personal institutional teamwork, importance early engagement trying head violence, need choose right people tasks kind (including 21st-century diplomats act "unconventionally"), necessity able apply appropriate force quickly.' Diplomacy When Conflict Is Seems Be Unavoidable When diplomacy fails prevent conflict, role diplomat changes. The new requirement may justify use force efforts avoid conflict fail seek address underlying source conflict force seems inevitable imperative. The February 1999 diplomatic negotiations Rambouillet, France, designed show world NATO Contact Group willing make one last effort avoid using military force stop Slobodan Milosevic's attacks Kosovo. I Rambouillet Assistant Secretary State European Affairs support Secretary Madeleine Albright. After first day meeting, much chaos I urged Secretary Albright depart Rambouillet leave "negotiating" us junior. My strategy present, Secretary State— administration—could keep distance outcome might unacceptable United States. The Secretary different vision. Albright hoped Rambouillet would end brutality Kosovars, also prepared meeting fail, thereby options avoiding military conflict would exhausted. Her idea seen everything could diplomatically, including continued presence, Rambouillet failure, could excuses taking military action. Secretary State James Baker pursued similar strategy first Gulf War 1991. Baker relates memoirs, The Politics Diplomacy, President George H.W. Bush concluded United States offer meeting Washington Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz followed Baker trip Baghdad show America's commitment avoiding war possible. Baker writes thought proposal three merits: would give administration one last diplomatic opening avoid war; would shore domestic support conflict; would show that, deadline Iraq's withdrawal Kuwait neared, administration something preparing war. The President's offer turned famous meeting Baker Aziz January 9, 1991. As Baker recounts, "I illusions. I assumed talks would unsuccessful within matter days, would war."8 In 2001-2003, State Department leadership generally saw Iraq diversion Afghanistan central war terror. Saddam Hussein dictator menace— "in box," posing immediate, direct threat United States; focus kept defeating al Qaeda Afghanistan supporting new Afghan government.9 Iraq source tension disagreement inside State Department since beginning administration, sought move policy support "smart" United Nations (UN) sanctions toward aggressive posture Saddam. Secretary State Henry Kissinger wrote Years Upheaval second term Nixon administration State Department culture emphasizes negotiability, consciousness side accept.' Kissinger consider trait particular positive time, department's culture negotiability serve good guide institutional behavior senior State officials participated interagency debate leading invasion Iraq. If period surrounding 1970s détente Russia, diplomatic efforts Shah Iran, crisis Middle East resulting 1973 war, culture negotiability longer served good guide institutional behavior senior State officials participated interagency debate leading invasion Iraq. We took part planning conflict aftermath assuming—or hoping—that events either home abroad would turn preparations conflict successful coercive diplomacy rather military action ordered spring 2003. The State Department's Director Policy Planning, Richard Haass, observed "60:40 going war. . . organization could function people left every time lost 60:40 decision."' Haass operating belief Iraq weapons mass destruction; known not, says would 90:10 war. And senior Department State officer resigned protest. The department sought instead try recreate successful Gulf War coalition President George H.W. Bush argued United States allies might compel Saddam submit deployment force region early 2003. If failed, sustained diplomatic effort create broad coalition move militarily later 2003. This possibility broad international coalition lost relevance January 20, 2003, French government announced would never support second UN Security Council resolution authorize use force Iraq. Diplomacy Preparation Conflict Once conflict inevitable initiated, one job diplomats support military commanders getting need make conflict short possible, fewest casualties Americans, allies, civilians. This objective United States pursued Turkey first Gulf War, resulted President Turgut Ozal's support American efforts. The diplomatic effort prepare conflict Kosovo also involved whole U.S. Government governments NATO Allies. To pursue successful bombing campaign, diplomats many NATO countries arranged overflight support Allied forces. A similar effort U.S. diplomats took place invasion Afghanistan 2001. American allied diplomats worked closely nations surrounding Afghanistan, including forging contacts Central Asian states security issues first time order achieve transit, overflight, bed-down rights American coalition forces October 7, 2001, beginning action Afghanistan. Before invasion Iraq March 2003, especially January 20, 2003, similar effort began earnest. Diplomats supported U.S. Central Command commander General Tommy Franks order make war short successful possible limit American, allied, Iraqi civilian casualties. American diplomats worked military commanders seek access facilities U.S. forces participate public diplomacy effort gain much support possible armed liberation Iraq. American diplomats Pentagon officials paid particular attention Turkey effort convince Turks allow 4th Infantry Division transit country create northern front battle Saddam's forces. Although State Department worried size Department Defense (DOD) request Ankara, worked closely civilian military authorities Pentagon try meet need identified Chairman Joint Chiefs Staff. Joint DOD—State diplomacy, however, could overcome negative vote Turkish parliament, reflected strong public opposition war. The way debate using force carried inside government influences attitudes actions conflict well future decisions whether use force. Military force may restore security, cannot resolve political cultural sources conflict. As Rupert Smith writes, "We engaging conflict objectives lead resolution matter directly force arms, since basic tactical level objectives tend concern intentions people leaders rather territory forces."' Smith argues civil-military structure designed make political- military decisions "deeply problematic" distorts decisionmaking many ways.13 In book, Smith imagines debate British Foreign Commonwealth Office (FCO) Ministry Defense (MOD) officials address genocide taking place number weeks Rwanda summer 1994. FCO: What face events Rwanda? MOD: What want us do? FCO: We ought act. Something must done. We can't people massacred. As permanent member UN Security Council cannot seen nothing. MOD: So want us use military force? FCO: Yes. MOD: To what? To stop killing? FCO: Yes. Exactly. MOD: Who want us fight? We clear killing: tribe tribe, force found _from tribe? And Rwanda big country. Where start? Kigali, presumably, it's capital would want airhead. FCO: Well, must international force, course. MOD: And would British aim joining force? FCO: To play part permanent member UN Security Council. MOD: Is Britain lead force? FCO: No, led UN—a proper UN mission. MOD: That take time assemble, probably late stop killing. FCO: Then mission aimed bringing postconflict order. MOD: OK But need clear many British troops currently available. Given deployments Ireland, Bosnia places, many. FCO: What suggest? MOD: What government's priorities? Is contributing force higher priority tasks already undertaking? FCO: Probably not. MOD: In case, UN forces always lack expeditionary logistic support. And want speed deployment force, offering logistic unit would probably valuable contribution. FCO: Will put soldiers risk? MOD: Hardly any." Many American diplomats recognize imaginary conversation, participated something like dozens times since fall Berlin Wall. In American debate, issue also quickly focuses pays bills. It worth stating, least American case, officials Pentagon DOD often legitimately frustrated State Department's inclination promote military missions Pentagon Armed Forces increasing number situations important, vital, U.S. national interests. While readiness volunteer U.S. military forces solve problems around world direct result lack civilian capacity jobs required, leads understandable consternation among uniform. Diplomacy Restoring Stability Following Conflict There many issues—defeating extremism, promoting pluralism, bringing benefits globalization yet benefited, living sustainably planet, nonproliferation— part definition successful 21st-century diplomacy. But getting postconflict diplomacy right—creating conditions preclusive victory—may crucial all. This easy assignment. The concept success redefined fact, complicating assessment. Successful democratic governance economic development cannot delivered certain date, therefore need time patience necessity ground. However, patience limited home countries, "fatigue" often sets in. Thus, potential failure high. Industrial war produced winners losers; today's lines clearly drawn, timeline may longer. Rupert Smith brings clarity assessment: We intervene even decide escalate to, conflict order establish condition political objective achieved means ways. We seek create conceptual space diplomacy, economic incentives, political pressure measures create desired political outcome stability, possible democracy. . . . decisive strategic victory hallmark interstate industrial war, establishing condition may deemed hallmark new paradigm war amongst people.15 Smith's point pressed even recognizing additional distinction military operation carried following Smith's rules ambiguity inherent trying create conditions Smith identifies objectives. Christopher Schnaubelt noted typical military operation unambiguous geographic boundaries (areas responsibility) assign specific units responsible every inch ground cubic foot airspace. There obvious chain responsibilities expected actions individual Soldier Marine ground commanding general. Nothing comparable exists economic development governance tasks, tend assigned function rather local geography rigid hierarchy authority.16 Postconflict diplomacy among defining diplomatic issues last third career State Department. In aftermath first Gulf War 1991, almost 500,000 Kurds fled mountains Iraq Turkey. Stranded harsh conditions, began starve thousands day. I Deputy Chief Mission Turkey. Inspired leadership Ambassador Morton Abramowitz, American diplomats, followed American military forces international coalition governments nongovernmental organizations, initiated Operation Provide Comfort (which became Operation Northern Watch). This "whole-of-government" "whole-of-theinternational- community" campaign provide humanitarian assistance return Kurds homes Northern Iraq. Once home, needed protected, 11 years, United Sates allies, including Turkey, worked ground recreate functioning society protected area Saddam enforcing no-fly zone. These years also punctuated activity Balkans. As Richard Holbrooke recounts, pre-Dayton negotiations Bosnian leader Alija Izetbegovi took place residence I Ambassador Turkey:7 As one Holbrooke's successors Assistant Secretary European Affairs, I watched effort made Ambassadors Robert Gelbard James Dobbins implement Dayton Accords applying whole-of-government efforts postconflict post- Yugoslavia. I picked diplomatic thread Under Secretary State Political Affairs promoting reconciliation, development, political progress, nationbuilding Kosovo. Other postconflict diplomacy efforts Haiti, East Timor, Liberia called upon resources United States governments try create conceptual space development sustained peace. The U.S. effort Colombia, too, highlighted need focus integrated cross-sectoral approach, included disarmament, demobilization, reintegration former combatants promoted justice postconflict society. But main events modern diplomacy's postconflict paradigm Afghanistan Iraq. The key understanding U.S. diplomacy postconflict Afghanistan Iraq recall profound disagreement inside U.S. Government, especially DOD State, whether United States engage "nationbuilding," policy President Bush campaigned 2000. State Department professionals generally proud effort United States made nationbuilding peacekeeping, supporting deployment U.S. military forces participate, example, Multinational Force Observers Sinai peacekeeping nationbuilding activities East Timor, Haiti, Balkans. Most believed nationbuilding, properly funded executed, effective long-term tool integrated modern diplomacy United States. The effort create new Afghan government overthrow Taliban piece classical diplomacy carried 21st-century context.'8 Secretary Powell directed Ambassador Dobbins support regional negotiation hosted Germans Bonn 2001 create new Afghan government. To succeed, Dobbins worked key players, including representatives Iran, support major role United Nations put Hamid Karzai position lead new Afghanistan.' But, Dobbins written, "Bush Administration, overthrown Taliban installed new government Kabul, determined American troops would peacekeeping peacekeepers countries would allowed venture beyond Kabul city limits. Public security throughout rest country would left entirely Afghans, despite fact Afghanistan army police force."2° The struggle nationbuilding also hampered American attempts get sufficient amounts U.S. international assistance Afghanistan. Washington accepted diffusion responsibility there, British taking charge counternarcotics, Italians reforming justice sector, Germans training police. This satisfied need burden-sharing lead success. In addition, postconflict resources focused United States Afghanistan small compared recent postconflict situations, even including Kosovo.' American diplomats followed Dobbins Embassy Kabul years faced legacy lack attention underinvestment.22 The State Department participated many levels National Security Council—led planning postconflict Iraq. Much planning detailed, focused lessons learned first Gulf War. The department's Future Iraq Project, important, would solved Iraq's postwar problems. State capacity take responsibility immediate postconflict administration Iraq, leadership agreed Executive order creating postconflict Iraq structure reported Secretary Defense. There need recount lost lives lost opportunities well chronicled others immediate postconflict period Iraq, although Dobbins's argument that, looking back, Coalition Provisional Authority accomplished great deal trying circumstances worth noting.23 On July 1, 2004, State Department officially open (on time budget) Embassy Baghdad, allowed expansion diplomacy led comprehensive senior civilian-military cooperation. There another important lesson draw recent postconflict efforts: need adequate civilian capacity respond, including role revitalized U.S. Agency International Development (USAID). As journal chronicled article' Ambassador John Herbst, Secretary State's Coordinator Reconstruction Stabilization (S/CRS), office mandated develop whole-ofgovernment civilian response stability operations ensure civilian-military coordination. The Civilian Response Corps (CRC) early stage, ultimately made reserve component, addition existing active standby components. The personnel anticipated represent full range sector experts: engineers, lawyers, judges, corrections officials, diplomats, development experts, public administrators, public health officials, city planners, border control officials, economists, others. Currently, active standby components stepped drawn State, USAID, core group domestic U.S. Agencies. Once congressionally funded, reserves would drawn state local governments private sector. Between January 2008 May 2009, 56 CRC members deployed 11 countries, including Afghanistan planning purposes, realistic plans 250 active members 1,000 standby members ready deploy end 2010. There least 14 countries United States allies civilian peacebuilding capacity—some including stability civilian police, employing wholeof- government "comprehensive" approaches similar created Washington. Several, fact, higher budgets proportionate gross national products America's.25 One way State support S/CRS effort would consider creating new personnel specialty: "expeditionary diplomat." Washington's diplomatic personnel have, course, always one sense expeditionary; majority Foreign Service deployed abroad majority time. But post-9/11 diplomatic experience, especially effort Iraq Afghanistan, means State needs explicit expeditionary nature future diplomatic work prepare small significant number people serve successfully hardest places moment's notice. Experience Provincial Reconstruction Teams Iraq Afghanistan, lessons learned S/CRS, example diplomats pursued careers toughest posts lead State leadership conclude step worth taking. The first requirement would advanced training, provided DOD Central Intelligence Agency, entering diplomats believe want pursue special career path. These entering officers would make explicit choice understand investment extra training would require service hard places, ask diplomats take hardest languages— Chinese Arabic, example—to serve one tour using skills. Since expeditionary diplomats need meet age physical requirements special operations military, State Department could allow people opt "special force" careers long proper training. This would allow flexibility across institution encourage desire whose family circumstances might change time participate well. The department would also need make sure taking career path recognized career beyond norm Foreign Service promoted rewarded. The creation S/CRS symbol comprehensive, simultaneous diplomacy needed future, expeditionary diplomat could form backbone State USAID commitment civilian response capacity. There still key questions answered civilian capacity. In face real world situation, DOD really support State Department—led operation? Will Congress adequately fund S/CRS, including reasonable contingency fund? How S/CRS resurgent USAID work together? Where lines drawn immediate postconflict needs nationbuilding? There seems question path right one, consistent administration's focus diplomacy, development, defense. Success come clear direction active implementation. If combine observations made several authors,' arrive question: What national policies, supported adequate human financial resources, create conditions war bring preclusive victory? Nation building, post- conflict reconstruction stability operations, counterinsurgency strategy (call will) part modern diplomacy years come. Accomplishing task exclusively American responsibility, and, indeed, one goals modern American diplomats make efforts international. But foreseeable future, United States need learn lessons role nation building Germany Iraq." These lessons include support new institutions bring elements power influence together theater, time, close coordination United States allies friends chance succeed.28 As Philip Bobbitt written, "The problem picture warfare cling. This picture unfolds way: peace making diplomats; war making Armed Forces; peace building [US]AID reconstruction personnel. The reality 21st century warfare, however, tasks must performed simultaneously."' While challenges opportunities 21st century observed analyzed individually, none solved without reference others. Diplomacy answer every question, utility conflict. As General Smith writes end volume: For general purpose interventions clear: seek establish minds people leaders ever present option conflict preferable course action confrontation matter another. This applies much state possessing nuclear weapons seeking obtain them, rogue otherwise, * terrorist machete-wielding rebel; posing armed threat people establish condition achieve political goal. To this, military force valid option, lever intervention influence, much economic, political diplomatic levers, effective must applied apart greater scheme focusing measures one goal.3° The connection utility modern diplomacy clear. Twenty-first-century diplomacy, working prevent conflict, trying get ready inevitable, dealing consequences, effective tool national security adequately funded, carried well-trained, dedicated people, focused clear goals set national leaders, backed effective military force.
