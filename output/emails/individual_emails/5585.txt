http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/opinion/16iht-edcohen.html?2=1&emc=eta18,pagewanted=print July 15, 2010 Inners arid Losers Ey ROGER COHEN NEW YORK — The Clintons threw big Washington bash June 30 Hillary Clinton's longtime aide, Hume Abedin, struck one many guests absence anyone President Obama's tight White House inner circle. Congressional heavyweights thronged garden Clinton spread Embassy Row, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The city's big powerbrokers various State Department honchos party marking Abedin's marriage Congressman Anthony Weiner New York. But White House insiders stayed away. Well, Bill Clinton told CNN recently, "I everything I could defeat President Obama I wanted Hillary win" — old wounds heal overnight. Indeed, may heal all. When informant said something old grievances going away, response hosts went something like this: No, don't never will. But, we're public servants suckers punishment, soldier on. Speaking soldiering on, Mrs. Clinton left Europe next day Americans celebrated July 4, Armenia trying sort Nagorno-Karabakh dispute and.— equally thankless task — mediate Armenia Turkey disagreement happened 1915. You've got salute Hillary. She's got guts go razor-sharp mind. It's heck job secretary state White House puts tight collar around big issues — Afghanistan, Iran, Israel-Palestine Iraq — you're left Nagorno-Karabakh, disputed Ottoman crimes World War I and, you're lucky, U.S. bases Okinawa. The situation might slightly less troubling boys White House — overwhelmingly boys — foreign-policy heavyweights. They're not. Indeed, I'm told Henry Kissinger refers "the kids." Chief among them, according colleague Helene Cooper, Denis McDonough, National Security Council's chief staff. Earlier month, Cooper wrote: "Forget Secretary State Hillary Rodham Clinton Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates. When comes national security, Mr. Obama's inner circle tight largely consists Mr. McDonough, 40-year-old Minnesota unknown Americans." I know McDonough I've spent fair amount time Minnesota. He many state's qualities: positive, brisk, can-do, affable efficient. But I reassured when! read Obama's national-security inner circle comprised him? Nope. He great guy control foreign-policy side campaign — perfection Obama — he's great guy think big world. Thinking big bold required right now. The clock ticking momentous presidential decisions. Among Afghan extrication salvage minimum core U.S. security interests — require bruising negotiation Taliban — Iran becomes apparent end year latest sanctions changed nothing. Obama's apparent carte blanche Israel month Iran disturbing. Then there's Israel-Palestine, Obama can't decide whether cost honest broker pressure sides — worth domestic heat takes critical Israel, result he's zigzagging little effect. After firing Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, Obama said would tolerate debate division. My sense foreign- policy house divided — weaker it. Gen. James Jones, national security adviser, speaks fine French — French love — he's left people unconvinced. Tom Donilon, Jones' deputy, dances around vacuum best can. Like McDonough, David Axelrod Rehm Emanuel brilliant campaign strategists, foreign-policy strategists? In Clinton, Obama Baker-class secretary state. For much longer going delegate Nagorno- Karabakh? The State Department, repository Other underused talent, cannot White House annex non- critical affairs. Back 1860s, James Gordon Bennett, editor New York Herald, forebear International Herald Tribune, gave instructions intrepid foreign correspondent named Henry Morton Stanley: "Draw thousand pounds now; gone that, draw another thousand, spent, draw another thousand, finished that, draw another thousand, on; but, FIND LIVINGSTONE." He referring lost African explorer, David Livingstone, Stanley eventually tracked Lake Tanganyika, uttering immortal words: "Doctor Livingstone, I presume?" That sort journalism's gone fashion. So thank Rolling Stone opening pocketbook telling Michael Hastings whatever took find General McChrystal. In brilliant piece, Hastings that. He also found something else: Afghan policy fragmented team Obama running it. McChrystal's gone, dysfunction. A blow-up, I presume? Watch space.
