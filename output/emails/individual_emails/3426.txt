In pursuit narrow even crude understanding interest, China constantly abuse break international rules, protocols bodies. Its willful destruction Copenhagen summit climate change reveals pattern. Its mercantile currency policy beggar-thy-neighbour approach, environmental degradation, disdain human rights rule law generally obvious reflections despotism. Through rough strange neo-imperialism, Africa especially also elsewhere, China able gain help, partly economic intimidation, international forays repel strike responsibilities internationalism. Internally, China prison nations, empire similar imperial Russia Soviet Union, may also unequal industrial country distribution income. China's power increasing, authoritarian regime hardly wave future awestruck worshippers raw power money (whether investment bankers ex-Marxists) imagine. The system inherently unstable, accounts rigid currency policy (at root fear operating virtual slave-labour standard, turning poverty-stricken millions consumers real choice, ultimately letting go even little bit).
