He also principal Salute Capital Management Ltd. Simon Johnson, former chief economist International Monetary Fund, co-author "13 Bankers."The Greek "rescue" package announced last weekend dramatic, unprecedented far enough stabilize euro zone.The Greek government European Union leadership, prodded International Monetary Fund, finally becoming realistic dire economic situation Greece. They abandoned previous rounds optimistic forecasts admitted profoundly worse situation. This new program calls "fiscal adjustments" — cuts fiscal deficit, mostly spending cuts — totaling 11 percent gross domestic product 2010, 4.3 percent 2011, 2 percent 2012 2013. The total debt-to-G.D.P. ratio peaks 149 percent 2012-13 starting gentle glide path back sanity.This new program honest enough show unlikely succeed.Daniel Gros, eminent economist euro zone issues based Brussels, argued 1 percent G.D.P. decline Greek government spending, total demand country falls 2.5 percent G.D.P. If government reduces spending 15 percent G.D.P. — initial shock demand could well 30 percent G.D.P.Obviously simple rule work large numbers, illustrates Greece likely experience sharp recession — substantial uncertainty around bad economy get. The program announced last weekend assumes Greek G.D.P. falls 4 percent year, another 2.6 percent 2011, recovering positive growth 2012 beyond.Such figures seem extremely optimistic, particularly face civil unrest sweeping Greece deep hostility expressed toward Greece northern European policy circles.The pattern growth critical because, program, Greece needs grow debt problem soon. Greece's debt-to-G.D.P. ratio debilitating 145 percent end 2011.Now consider putting realistic growth figures I.M.F. forecast Greece's economy — e.g., G.D.P. declining 12 percent 2011, debt-to-G.D.P. ratio may reach 155 percent. At levels, 5 percent real interest rate growth, country needs primary surplus 8 percent G.D.P. keep debt-to- G.D.P. ratio stable. It nowhere near level. The I.M.F. program Greece running primary budget deficit around 1 percent G.D.P. year, assumes path Greek growth regarded "upside scenario."The politics implied budget surpluses remains brutal. Since Greek debt held abroad, roughly 80 percent budget savings Greek government makes go straight Germans, French foreign debt holders (mostly banks). If growth turns poorly, Greeks prepared ever-tougher austerity pay Germans? Even everything goes well, Greek citizens seem unlikely welcome version "new normal." Last week European leadership panicked — late day — realized euro zone risk meltdown. If euro zone proves unwilling protect member like Greece default, bond investors run Portugal Spain also — doubt this, study carefully interlocking debt picture published recently The New York Times. Higher yields government debt would caused concerns potential bank runs nations, spread nations Europe.When "run," clear stops. In hazy distance, Belgium, France, Austria many others potentially risk. Even Germans cannot afford bail nations.Slapped face ugly scenario, Europeans decided throw everything I.M.F. bailing Greece. The program announced small chance preventing eventual Greek bankruptcy, may still slow avert dangerous spiral downward — enormous collateral damage — rest Europe.The I.M.F. floated fashion alternative scenario debt restructuring, rejected European Union Greek authorities. This surprise; leading European policy makers completely unprepared broader problems would follow Greek "restructuring," markets would immediately mark debt (i.e., increase yields) Portugal, Spain, Ireland even Italy.The fear panic face would unparalleled modern times: When Greeks pay 50 percent face value debt, investors expect Portuguese Spanish? It becomes arbitrary, including countries dragged down.Someone decide defended cost, European structures completely unsuited kind tough decision-making pressurein extreme downside scenario, Germany obvious safe haven within euro zone, government bond yields would collapse governments face sharply rising yields. The euro zone would likely hold together.There still narrow escape path, without immediate debt default chaos would produce:- Talk euro — moving toward parity American dollar would help lift growth across euroz one.- As euro falls, bond yields rise euro zone periphery. This create episodes panic. Enough short-term financing must place support rollover government debt.. Once euro fallen great deal, announce European Central Bank support euro levels (i.e., prevent appreciation, G-20 tacit agreement), also support peripheral euro zone nations viewed solvent buying bonds whenever markets chaotic.• At stage, before, euro zone leadership needs push weaker governments restructure. That include Greece perhaps also Portugal. Hopefully, scenario Spain muddle through.• European banks recapitalized necessary management replaced. This massive failure euro groupthink — including notably political level — question bank executives behaved responsibly long replaced en masse.To extent possible, ensuing losses shared bank creditors. But careful wish for. The bankers powerful reason; built vital yet fragile structures heart economies. Dismantle care.
