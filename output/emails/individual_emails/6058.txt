Besides providing forum debating European politics, symposium occasion first public appearance Europe Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa since awarded Nobel Prize Literature last month. The arrival Vargas Llosa, one world's foremost intellectuals, resulted overflow crowd filled members Dutch media, country's political class, royal family. Even Vargas Llosa spotlight, participants' attention focused Geert Wilders, leader far-right Dutch People's Party Freedom Democracy, third leading party Netherlands. With gathering influence, Wilders essentially placed Dutch coalition government stranglehold; government meets every Wednesday gauge opinions ask instructions. While Wilders dictates government, remains independent it, comfortably avoiding consequences policies helped shape. It perfect position politician whose agenda comprised exclusively xenophobic populism, typical strategy far-right countries across continent. Wilders' base lies mostly Catholic south, ironically people ever encountered Muslim. He also generated support city Groeningen, citadel communists. Seeking expand base, Wilders promised hire scores "animal cops" investigate prosecute abuse animals, clever wedge strategy country I know party dedicated exclusively animal rights. Of course, Wilders could care less furry friends. His stated goal end immigration Holland Europe; ban Quran (free speech "Judeo-Christian" community), severely limit rights Muslim citizens Europe by, instance, instituting called "head rag tax" Muslim women. Wilders' international allies include goosestepping neo- Nazis English Defense League, far-right pogromist Pam Geller, Belgian neo-fascist party Vlaams Belang, substantial portion US neocon elite. Over course years, become perhaps influential Islamophobe world. But make Wilders fascist? Rob Riemen, director Nexus Institute, thinks so. Riemen published book entitled "De Eeuwige Terugkeer Van Het Fascisme," "The Eternal Return Fascism" (I eagerly await English translation), dedicated highlighting danger Wilders' eerily familiar brand right-wing populism. In book, Riemen urges readers compare Wilders' politics early incarnations European fascism, genocidal terminal stage fascism late World War II. He calls parallels Wilders early fascists "one- and-one." In economic civilizational crisis like kind Netherlands facing, Riemen warns reactionary figures like Wilders easily seize power centrist elements stand politely passively, refusing call spade spade. Where Wilders' ascendancy lead unknown, stopped tracks, Riemen certain B6 story end well. In week publication, Riemen's book flew shelves, selling 5000 copies generating heated reactions across spectrum debate. Riemen told despite public enthusiasm book, characterization Wilders attacked "un- Dutch." In Dutch culture, many others, open confrontation avoided cost. Political disagreement welcomed expressed collegial manner, though nothing reputations stake. So Dutch cultural elite generally goes along get along. The resistance Riemen met since called Wilders seemed alarmed frustrated him. Why difficult liberal elements Netherlands recognize clear resonances fascism Wilders' political style? wondered. And seem concerned regulating terms debate forming united front far-right? Once symposium opened I able see Dutch elite action, I began understand Riemen's indignation. The symposium began speech Vargas Llosa, complex personality allied center-right parties Spain elsewhere whose politics remain fundamentally rooted cultural liberalism. Vargas Llosa's differences leaders left, used belong to, exploded issue free trade. He ardent neo- liberal reviles Latin populists like Hugo Chavez 011anta Humala advocate protectionism industrial nationalization. Vargas Llosa decorated speech literary metaphors natural imagery describe challenges democracy, particularly Europe. But body address devoted supposed threat Islamic extremism posed Western civilization. Vargas Llosa singled suicide bombing dangerous phenomenon, pointing Madrid London bombings al-Qaida inspired operatives, curiously mentioning suicide attacks secular groups like Tamil Tigers Kurdish PKK, nationalistic suicide terror Palestinian militants (Vargas Llosa declared speech "Israel deserves treated like nation," harshly critical state past). During first panel, I participated in, Fania Oz-Salzberger, Israeli professor history daughter famed author Amos Oz, boasted crowd Israel's "vibrant democracy." She enthusiastically seconded Mitchell Cohen, former editor Dissent devoted considerable energy assailing anti-Zionist Jews, writing "the dominant species anti-Semitism encourages anti-Zionism." I found odd neither expressed concern almost endless stream anti-democratic laws passing Knesset, general authoritarian, anti-liberal trend Israeli society. Oz-Salzberger went announce smattering applause "Geert Wilders politicians like welcomed Israelis." Yet Wilders one Israel's frequent guests, visited country 40 times 20 years. In fact, claims views Islam Arabs forged living Israeli moshav. "Nowhere I special feeling solidarity I get I land Ben Gurion airport," said. Wilders reportedly receives heavy support Dutch financial backers Israel, met range Israeli officials. His closest allies lie within extremist settler movement, prompting call forced transfer Palestinians Jordan. Members liberal Zionist intelligensia like Oz-Salzberger may want Wilders around, Israel listening them? Israel's mainstream leadership echoes Wilders' crudest talking points regular basis, Zionist left clings dwindling handful Knesset seats watches passively — even resentfully — rag-tag band leftist radicals fights equality all. Consider recent statement former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, seen centrist within Israeli political spectrum: "The origin terrorism within Islam," Olmert declared month. The pro-Israel position new breed European far-rightists recognized much convenient political tactic. Of course, saying "stand Israel," Wilders often does, easy way insulate charges anti-Semitism. But extreme right also attracted Israel country represents highest ideals. While critics see Israel racist apartheid state, people like Wilders see Israel racist apartheid state — like it. They richly enjoy Israel mows Arab Muslims dozens tells world go hell; admire Israel's settler culture; all, yearn live land like Israel privileges ethnic majority others point systematically humiliates dispossesses swarthy racial outclass. The endgame far-right make Europe less tolerant Israeli. After Italian philosopher Paolo Flores D'Arcais proclaimed Italy longer democratic country, citing PM Silvio Berlusconi's control 90 percent country's media, government's deep seated corruption Prime Minister's repeated attempts impose onerous restrictions journalistic freedom, Riemen asked United States democracy given rapidly rising influence corporations media elections. After two panelists described Israel vibrant democracy another labeled Italy non-democratic quasi-dictatorship, I decided definition democracy subjective best. So I sidestepped question outlined greatest blows American democracy, elimination Fairness Doctrine Telecommunications Deregulation Act Citizens United SCOTUS decision. Later evening, D'Arcais would remark amazement never knew American media ever regulated first place. During 20 minutes students Tilburg University able question panel, one student asked whether suicide terror uniquely Islamic phenomenon, apparently referring Vargas Llosa's address. I responded course not, citing example secular groups like Tamil Tigers brought tactic practice second suicide. I recommended audience review research Robert Pape, University Chicago political scientist demonstrated clear connection American Israeli occupation Middle Eastern countries motivations suicide bombers. Oz-Salzberger jumped in, proclaiming occupation little nothing motives suicide bombers. She marshal evidence support point, possibly time limited. It would hard so, however, without supporting fundamental argument Wilders Islam's inherent violence — even sillier theory Israeli filmmaker/professional hasbarist Pierre Rehov suicide bombers motivated sexual repression. Next, Dutch panel took stage. The main attraction Frits Bolkstein, longtime leader People's Party Freedom Democracy employed Wilders parliamentary aide, providing stepping stone political career. He silver haired curmudgeon aristocratic stock reminded instantly "paleocon" characters I've met covering white nationalist conventions like American Renaissance. "Everything went wrong government became impressed 90's idea 'good stranger," Bolkstein declared. "If previous governments tightened immigration laws, would Mr. Wilders." The member panel mount significant challenge Bolkstein Tilburg University professor Paul Frissen, argued rule law basic standards democracy protects "the right fundamentalist." The panelists either gave Bolkstein's xenophobia pass attempted surpass resentment Muslims. After Bolkstein lightly criticized Wilders' call banning Quran, remarking "what says Islam nonsense" contradicts freedom religion, AB Klink, former Dutch senator ex-Minister Health, chimed in."It's nonsense Islam different cultural values ours," Klink claimed. Then, Bolkstein called shutting Islamic schools, Frissen reminded state-supported Christian schools Dutch Bible belt teach theocratic concepts well. Meindert Fennema, political biographer Wilders, entered debate demand religious schools closed. "I'm forms religious teaching!" proudly exclaimed, sending gales applause audience. "How call liberal?" Frissen asked tone exasperation. Fennema ignored him. During question time, young freelance writer India named Natasha Ginwala asked Bolkstein answer "ghost neo-colonialism," "the African people never voted for." She mentioned exploitative deals forced developing countries transnational oil companies, possibly alluding Bolkstein's role manager Royal Dutch Shell authoritarian countries like El Salvador, Indonesia, Honduras 1970's (I'm sure nothing unseemly happened Bo!stein's tenure places). Bolkstein's responded bluntly, "If countries try self- sufficient doesn't work!" After symposium, I talked Ginwala group friends, mostly immigrant students. They appalled ignorance Dutch panelists. "None knew first thing Islam," Arab student remarked. "They couldn't even pretend understand Muslims actually believe." Ginwala added, "How Bolkstein tell country can't self-sufficient? I come India. It's one diversified economies planet." I Amsterdam long enough formal reporting. However, I notice immigrants I spoke closely nervously following rise right. At airport, waiting board flight, I talked 20- something security guard named Muhammad seemed almost bored I was. Muhammad spent whole life Amsterdam, parents Cairo, Egypt. He told wanted take girlfriend trip New York City Miami someday. When I brought topic Wilders, scoffed perception Muslims. "Most us aren't even religious," Muhammad said. "When I hear talking Muslims wanting take over, I laugh. I'm like, guy serious?" But underestimate Wilders' appeal. "Everything everything says, seems like it's carefully planned. He obviously knows he's doing. And let get away it," Muhammad remarked. "Look, I'm citizen, I'm nobody, I say something Christians Jews government doesn't like, I'll punished. But Wilders, public official, says things says Muslims, nothing happens him. Instead, people voting him."
