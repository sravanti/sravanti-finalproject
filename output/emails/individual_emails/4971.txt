H: Jim Fellows told speech thrilled it. He's returned three years China. He didn't expect would frank. Here's post The Atlantic website. Sid http://jamesfallows.theatiantic.comiarchives/2010/01/a_momentous_40_hours.php#more Xr 07: Hi!!ary Clinton's "Internet freedom speech iVian A momentous 40 hours, leading Clinton/China/Internet 21 Jan 2010 04:12 pm Apart two obvious pieces momentous news past day-and-a-half -- new junior Senator Massachusetts, new ckv V. V5- rvi,- , , c.:! (by I mean today's lamentable, straight-party-line Supreme Court ruline ;that removes limits direct corporate underwriting political campaigns) -- one event today big ripple effects. mean SecState Hillary Clinton's speech morning "Internet Freedom," mentioned ;:lere prelude discussion I'm going take time thorough gloss speech. Instead I highly recommend reading full text, lette, watching official video, .'tere. And main points listening (and noting main points real time handy ' uiveaSccibe, pen.) - In contrast dreamy Internet optimism decade ago -- I'm naming names, I remember! -- many people imagined info technology, itself, would undermine oppression bring world together, Clinton started astringent reminder technology, like others, neither good bad already used helpful destructive ways: "Amid unprecedented surge connectivity, must also recognize technologies unmitigated blessing. These tools also exploited undermine human progress political rights. Just steel used build hospitals machine guns, nuclear power either energize city destroy it, modern information networks technologies support harnessed good ill. The networks help organize movements freedom also enable al-Qaida spew hatred incite violence innocent. And technologies potential open access government promote transparency also hijacked governments crush dissent deny human rights." And nice pivot section, effective it's blunt plain: "On own, new technologies take sides struggle freedom progress, United States does." - Underscoring "this big deal" tone speech, enumerated "Four Freedoms" FDR proclaimed 1941, part struggle world's future, said comparable set Four Freedoms Internet age. Check speech details. - The China surprise: speech frontal challenge Chinese internet overall censorship policy I expected, I recall US-China interactions long time. For instance, early speech, itemization places suppression getting worse: "In last year, we've seen spike threats free flow information. China, Tunisia, Uzbekistan stepped censorship Internet. In Vietnam, access popular social networking sites suddenly disappeared. And last Friday Egypt, 30 bloggers activists detained." Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Egypt -- grouping countries Chinese government, recent sense rise superpower status, used lumped with. Compared US financial power, OK; overtaking japan economic size, yes; crucial player environmental negotiations.., one thing. Bracketed sentence Tunisia Uzbekistan different. Sentences like don't appear formal, big- deal SecState addresses accident. Other passages effect: "As I speak today, government censors somewhere working furiously erase words records history. But history already condemned tactics.... "Those disrupt free flow information society pose threat economy, government, civil society. Countries individuals engage cyber attacks face consequences international condemnation...." And Google section itself. I wondered whether speech would mention Google name -- reason think might not. (Main argument forleavina implicit rather referring directly Google case: company's ongoing efforts find "il lvineyiftaiv_in" acceptable way remain China, rather lose-lose-lose permanent split, necessarily help U.S. government standing officially side. ) But way Sec. Clinton introduced point significant: proxy China's ability H.to,tentiai sustain economic rise: "To use market terminology, publicly listed company Tunisia Vietnam operates environment censorship always trade discount relative identical firm free society. If corporate decision makers don't access global sources news information, investors less confidence decisions long term. Countries censor news information must recognize economic standpoint, distinction censoring political speech commercial speech. If businesses nations denied access either type information, inevitably impact growth. "Increasingly, U.S. companies making issue internet information freedom greater consideration business decisions. I hope competitors foreign governments pay close attention trend. The recent situation involving Google attracted great deal interest. And look Chinese authorities conduct thorough review cyber intrusions led Google make announcement. And also look investigation results transparent. "The Internet already source tremendous progress China, fabulous. There many people China online. But countries restrict free access information violate basic rights internet users risk walling progress next century. Now, United States China different views issue, intend address differences candidly consistently context positive, cooperative, comprehensive relationship." There's lot speech, including terrorism, disaster relief, religion, etc -- it's reading. Back to-do list now. Peirmalink .Share This
