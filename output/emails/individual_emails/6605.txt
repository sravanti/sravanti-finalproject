sbwhoeop Saturday, October 9, 2010 10:50 AM H: Dems demand Boehner remove GOP Nazi reenactor. Put Boehner blitzkrieg. Sid Why This GOP House Candidate Dressed Nazi? By Joshua Green An election year already notable menagerie extreme unusual candidates add another one: Rich lott, Republican nominee Congress Ohio's 9th District, Tea Party favorite, years donned German Waffen SS uniform participated Nazi re-enactments. Rich lott, second right, Nazi SS Waffen uniform. lott, whose district lies Northwest Ohio, involved group calls Wiking, whose members devoted re-enacting exploits actual Nazi division, 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking, fought mainly Eastern Front World War 11. lott's participation Wiking group mentioned campaign's website, name photographs removed Wiking website.When contacted The Atlantic, lott confirmed involvement group number years, said interest Nazi Germany historical subscribe tenets Nazism. "No, absolutely not," said. "In fact, there's disclaimer [Wiking] website. And you'll find almost reenactment website. it's purely historical interest World War II." Rich lott wife, shown campaign website. lott, member Ohio Military Reserve, added, "I've always fascinated fact relatively small country strictly military point view accomplished incredible things. I mean, took Europe Russia, really took combined effort free world defeat them. From purely historical military point view, that's incredible." lott says group chose Wiking division part fought Eastern Front, mainly Russian Army, U.S. British soldiers. The group's website includes lengthy history Wiking unit, recruitment video, footage goose-stepping German soldiers marching Warsaw victory parade Poland fell 1939. The website makes scant mention atrocities committed Waffen SS, includes glancing reference "twisted" nature Nazism. Instead, emphasizes Wiking unit fought Bolshevist Communism: Nazi Germany problem recruiting multitudes volunteers willing lay lives ensure "New Free Europe", free threat Communism. National Socialism seen - many Holland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, eastern European Balkan countries protector personal freedom way life, despite true underlying totalitarian (and quite twisted, cases) nature movement. Regardless, thousands upon thousands valiant men died defending respective countries name better tomorrow. We salute idealists; matter unsavory Nazi government was, front-line soldiers Waffen-SS (in particular foreign volunteers) gave lives loved ones basic desire free. Historians Nazi Germany vehemently dispute characterization. "These guys don't know history," said Charles W. Sydnor, Jr., retired history professor author "Soldiers Destruction: The SS Death's Head Division, 1933-45," chronicles SS division. "They sanitized, romanticized view occurred." Sydnor added re- enactments like Wiking group's illegal Germany Austria. "If put SS uniform Germany today, you'd arrested."

He says name pictures removed Wiking website concern would harm political career, quit group three years ago, son lost interest. loft participated group name, also alias "Reinhard Pferdmann," also removed, lott described German alter ego. "Part reenactor's [experience]," lott said, "is living-history part, really trying get persona time period. In many, unit, many units individuals create person largely based Germanized version name, history kind based around real experiences. 'Reinhard' course 'Richard' German. And 'Pferdmann,"pferd' horse. So it's literally 'horse man." Asked whether participation Nazi re-enactor's group might upset voters, particularly Jewish voters, loft said hoped would not: "They take context. There's reenactors everything. You couldn't Civil War re-enacting somebody didn't play role Confederates. [This] something that's definitely way past. ... [I hope voters] take context see is, interest World War II history. And that's strictly all." 0 lott Nazi re-enactment. Rabbi Moshe Saks, Congregation B'nai Israel Sylvania, Ohio, suburb Toledo sits 9th district, disagreed. "Any kind reenactment glorification Nazi Germany, us, would something unacceptable certainly poor taste, offensive," said. "I think reaction negative. And among Jewish community, broader community." In follow-up email today, loft seemed pains address concerns conduct may alienated veterans groups made specific mention possible offense Jews human rights groups: "Never, reenacting military history, I meant disrespect anyone served military anyone affected tragedy war. In fact, I immense respect veterans served country valiantly, respect military veterans one reasons I actively studied military history throughout life." He added participated re-enactments Civil War Union infantryman, World War I dough boy World War II American infantryman paratrooper. The actual Wiking unit history grisly Nazi divisions. In book "The Death Marches Hungarian Jews Through Austria Spring 1945," Eleonore Lappin, noted Austrian historian, writes soldiers Wiking division involved killing Hungarian Jews March April 1945, surrendering American forces Austria. "What often hear [Wiking] division never formally accused anything, that's kind dodge," says Prof. Rob Citino, Military History Center University North Texas, examined Wiking website. "The entire German war effort East racial crusade rid world 'subhumans,' Slays going enslaved numbers tens millions. And course multimillion Jewish population Eastern Europe going exterminated altogether. That's folks East. It sends shiver spine think people want dress play SS weekend."
