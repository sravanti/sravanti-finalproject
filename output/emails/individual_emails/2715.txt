Hillary: FYI: I found one sensible informed brief articles Afghanistan. Patrick Cockburn, London Independent, one best informed on-the-ground journalists. He almost always correct Iraq. Sid Patrick Cockburn: To say war must won year nonsense http://www.independent co.uk/opinion/commentators/patrick-cockbum-to-say-this-war-must-be-won- in-a-year-is-nonsense-1799296.html Thursday, 8 October 2009 SPONSORED LINKS: Eight years ago I standing hill 50 miles north Kabul watching flashes night sky US air strikes started st Taliban front line. There ineffective puffs fire Taliban anti-aircraft guns could nothing bombs missiles raining them. It strange war cover, least little real fighting took place. The reputation Afghan fighting man partly based agilely joining winning side right moment. In meantime don't fight hard anybody try avoid getting killed. The US British press mostly reported war 2001 real military conflict rather missed point Taliban gone home. I remember visiting former headquarters Taliban armoured brigade city Ghazni south west Kabul. The tanks armoured vehicles smashed pieces American bombs, I asked local people many men Taliban lost, I told "none all. They could see going happen ran away." Just US military victory 2001 overstated, eight years later sense military crisis busily stoked Gen Stanley A McChrystal, top US NATO commander Afghanistan. In Washington military officials quoted saying war won lost next twelve months. This nonsense. The Taliban able advance rapidly last three years Pakistani backing spectacular political military weakness President Hamid Karzai's government. But Taliban draw strength Pashtun community, makes 42 per cent Afghan population. They great difficulty advancing areas occupied 58 per cent population Tajik, Hazara Uzbek majority. Squads six eight Taliban motorcycles might harassing roads around Kabul, need treat North Vietnamese divisions gates Saigon 1975. The strength Taliban take hold territory, inflict quite small military losses US politically unacceptable back home. They roadside bombs, something US army speaks f new device, though used British army Ireland 1921. If Americans British try hold territory supposedly cleared Taliban penny packets troops vulnerable suddenly targeted side. It prevent happening Gen McChrystal asked extra 40,000 soldiers. But Afghans tell foreign troops simply mean violence dead Afghans country becomes battlefield. It absurd imagine world's heavily equipped military force going use weapons comes attack. Polls also show Taliban support height areas Afghan civilians killed American shells bombs. So Obama do? First time. He going win lose war next year. Like stuck Mr Karzai get used idea. It reasonable suggest helping produce larger Afghan army police force cannot done overnight. Most military recruits money malnourished even wear American flack jackets. Speeding security training f Afghan police meant summer terrified men, often heroin, sent man dangerous isolated police posts three weeks training. Many come back. One way Obama could strengthen Afghan army police make sure men paid properly. In Kabul many facilities guarded policemen earning $70 month, enough live unless supplemented bribes. This contrasts $250,000 year paid foreign consultants lurk inside heavily defended compounds. Paying Iraqi army properly really make difference Baghdad might Afghanistan 40 per cent men unemployed. A difference Iraqi oil revenues last year $62 billion Afghan government dependent foreign aid. The US allies pay. It carefully thought measures like Obama considering panicky dispatch US Special Forces tens thousand troops.
