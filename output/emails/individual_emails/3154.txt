I've attached gorgeous cover PDF Hillary's Moment: Clinton Faces World By Joe Klein Time Magazine Wednesday, Nov. 04, 2009 It Halloween night Jerusalem, Benjamin Netanyahu came dressed peacemaker. "We're prepared start peace talks immediately," notoriously reluctant Israeli Prime Minister proclaimed, U.S. Secretary State Hillary Clinton standing side, poker-faced. "I think ... get get it." It ploy, course. The Palestinians tangled themselves, yet again. They elections looming, leader, Mahmoud Abbas, hang tough: demanding total freeze Israeli settlement-building West Bank — precisely Obama Administration previously said favored. Netanyahu offering partial freeze, including new settlements East Jerusalem, desired capital future Palestinian state. This nonstarter Palestinians, holographic glow step forward. It "unprecedented" offer, Netanyahu trumpeted, joy chess master springing trap.(See photos 60 years Israel.) It tough moment Clinton, playing second fiddle Bibi-does-Gandhi show. President Barack Obama softened language settlements weeks earlier: instead total freeze, talked Israeli "restraint" settlement-building. And Clinton seemed cement Administration's retreat, agreeing Netanyahu's proposal was, indeed, "unprecedented," even though U.S. still favored total freeze. The important thing, added, parties get table quickly possible. The onus back Palestinians — Palestinians quickly expressed outrage Obama Administration's retreat. Their Arab neighbors soon joined in, causing Clinton backtrack two days later, telling reporters Israeli plan "falls far short" U.S. expectations, although still insisted calling "unprecedented," neither diplomatic wise. Suddenly Obama Administration seemed wobbly Middle East; clearly, Clinton bullish Netanyahu's proposal (which negotiated months Middle East envoy George Mitchell seen, privately, Americans real progress). But Administration's mission get parties peace talks without preconditions. The Israelis favor talks. The Palestinians setting preconditions. And Clinton violated essential rule job: boring almost always better.(See photos life career former Secretary State Madeleine Albright.) Clinton's Three Qualities For past 40 years, awkward Middle East press conference helped define job Secretary State. You go Jerusalem Ramallah; stand "guardedly optimistic" public; private, try move comma, Israelis Palestinians move, semicolon block comma. The result almost always same: gridlock. The breakthroughs, come, emanate others. Walter Cronkite asks Anwar Sadat he'd willing go Jerusalem ... Sadat, everyone's surprise, says yes. The Israelis Palestinians hold secret meetings Oslo reach appears breakthrough — they're talking! — becomes another dead end. The job Secretary State thankless glamorous; ways, Department State, noble antique, still trying come terms invention telephone. In era Twitter haiku-messaging rules, diplomacy moves speed, requires nuanced complexity, literature. Power drifted State National Security Council Pentagon, especially wartime. Only Clinton's recent predecessors distinguished themselves. Henry Kissinger, National Security Adviser belatedly became Secretary State, Richard Nixon's schizophrenic alter ego; George Shultz strong policy voice Reagan Administration; James Baker clout George H.W. Bush's best friend world-class dealmaker. Most others frustrated forgettable. And yet Hillary Clinton we're talking — second popular American world, eternally compelling supremely talented character, subject constant speculation, walking headline. Her presence job makes crucial more. It cliché say naming Clinton, Obama brought popular potential opponent tent. The conventional wisdom, cynical half, thereby succeeded neutering her, theory bolstered Clinton's reticence first nine months job, special envoys like Mitchell Richard Holbrooke heavy lifting diplomacy. But naming Clinton, Obama also gave great power, cuts ways: becomes dissatisfied role Administration's policies, become torpedo aimed Oval Office. Colin Powell similar power real gripe — Iraq war — never used it. Clinton gripe, Obama Administration settles policy differences begin emerge among key players, Powell conundrum looms: How Clinton choose use power? How Obama react does? Traditionally, Secretary State judged ability formulate policy, negotiate deals manage striped-pants bureaucracy. Clinton history global strategist, although performance 2008 campaign indicates bit conservative President, foreign policy realist Wilsonian idealist. It also early judge skill manager negotiator — although performance Jerusalem indicates needs lessons Middle East Haggling 101. There are, however, three qualities could make memorable Secretary State. She brings vision departmental reform — need elevate foreign aid programs status rigorous scrutiny diplomacy — could change striped pants chinos developing world. She also first elected politician hold office since Edmund Muskie briefly Carter Administration, enabled better understand interact politicians run places like Afghanistan Pakistan. But important, international celebrity much higher profile recent predecessors ability — second President's — change negative attitudes U.S. abroad. She potential become powerful public diplomat U.S. fielded quite time, although performance far, home abroad, occasionally perplexing. At home, often seemed tentative deferential. In conversation Secretary Defense Robert Gates aired CNN early October, Clinton's cautious formality took backseat Gates' brisk, humorous confidence policy issues. Abroad, seems far confident, times point recklessness, Jerusalem. (See photos last days Hillary Clinton's campaign.) Independence Candor In last week October, Secretary Clinton moved squarely center world stage, attempting, behest special envoys, improve rocky alliance Pakistan nudge Middle East pugilists talks. In course trip, first stray wisps hint Clinton wanted begin asserting independence, Administration, facing roadblocks across world, struggled firmer foreign policy tone opening nine months might called Rodney King — "Can't get along?" — phase. During three days Pakistan, ran gauntlet town-hall meetings media interviews may unprecedented, use word week, U.S. Secretary State. The trip, planned Holbrooke Pakistan specialist Vali Nasr, offered unusually subtle itinerary U.S. diplomatic mission. A visit Sufi mosque bombed Sunni extremists, example, sent powerful message Pakistan's moderate Islamic majority. "We saw praying there," academic named Shala Aziz told me, "and, first time, I'm thinking, The Americans hearts."(See photos suicide bombings Islamabad.) The big news Clinton allowed hammered hostile questions students, talk-show hosts Pashturi elders -- that, occasion, pushed back, raising incredibly sensitive issues, like one Pakistani government knew Osama bin Laden was, even though country since 2002. Press accounts either emphasized embarrassment Secretary State's getting pummeled fixed Clinton's undiplomatic bluntness. But missed point: candor, willingness listen acknowledge criticism, begun undermine prevailing Pakistani image U.S. arrogant bossy, interested Pakistani military fight war al-Qaeda Taliban true strategic partnership. The contrast especially sharp George W. Bush's eight years unqualified support military dictatorship Pervez Musharraf. "In past, Americans came, would talk generals go home," said Farahnaz Ispahani, government spokeswoman Member Parliament. "Clinton's willingness meet everyone, hostile not, made big impression — she's Hillary Clinton, real history affinity country, means much more." Transformative Experience There toasts state dinners Pakistan, alcohol. There opening statements, though, Clinton's — delivered impromptu first night trip tossing aside notes — surprisingly emotional. Earlier day, President Asif Ali Zardari, widower Benazir Bhutto, presented Secretary album photos first visit Pakistan, 1995, framed photo Bhutto two sons Clinton daughter Chelsea. "It bring tears eyes," Clinton said state dinner honor presidential palace, "because I admired wife. She gave life ..." She faltered then, choking up, quickly pulled together, talking "reasons — provide opportunities all." Clinton's first trip Pakistan First Lady 1995 transformative experience — beginning, I believe, the•process made plausible candidate Secretary State. I traveled trip; set off, seemed depressed even private usual. The Democrats cratered 1994 congressional elections, trounced efforts enact universal health care plan. It personal defeat; Clinton traveled country trying sell plan, crowds shouted cursed her. Privately admitted shocked hatred. The trip South Asia seemed bit vacation — Chelsea's spring break — also retreat demure, First Lady–like role two years health care policy czar, although proceeded decidedly wonky, Hillarian fashion. Jackie Kennedy gone India famously ridden elephant; Hillary Clinton traveled five countries packed schedule visits NGOs. "That greatest trip, unbelievable," Clinton says now. We sitting hotel suite day Jerusalem gaffe, Secretary electric-blue shift rather usual formal jacket pants. She wearing glasses appeared rather freckly without makeup. "I guess trip animated informed everything I've done since," said. She emerged trip reinvigorated, new mission. By end 1995, U.N. Conference Women Beijing, First Lady propounded new Clinton Doctrine: "Women's rights human rights."(See photos Beijing's changing skyline.) Clinton easy interview. She preternaturally cautious, consequence Methodist propriety 20 years insane public scrutiny. She like talk herself, tell one interesting story Bhutto. When husband governor Arkansas, Bill Chelsea visited London stood sidewalk outside Bhutto's hotel, waiting Pakistani Prime Minister arrive. "She wearing yellow embroidered shalwar kameez chiffon scarf. I fan, standing sidewalk everyone else. It time I ever anything like that," Clinton says. When Clinton Bhutto met formally, first day 1995 trip, hit immediately, part Bhutto also obsessed impact Islamist tide women children. I remember asking Bhutto day biggest change country past 25 years, said, "I used able walk street wearing jeans, without headscarf. Now I can't." When I asked why, said — bluntly — "The Saudis," aggressively funding religious schools. Of course, Bhutto's acquiescence to, participation in, general corruption Pakistani government part reason public schools inadequate madrasahs became popular. (See photos aftermath Benazir Bhutto's assassination 2007.) Ironically, rise Sunni extremist groups like al-Qaeda brought Clinton's interests — microfinance, education health care — center national-security policy first time. The impetus came State Department military, counterinsurgency doctrine demanded social services war zones - schools, justice, economic development — reinforce military's efforts secure population. As result, immediate chemistry Clinton General David Petraeus, author Army's counterinsurgency manual, became one prime military mentors served Senate Armed Services Committee. At one point, well Obama made presidential intentions known, I asked Petraeus potential Democratic candidate understood mind worked, said, "You mean, aside Hillary?" It Clinton brought together Petraeus Holbrooke ("my two alpha males," calls them) first time - home Washington Friday Obama Inauguration. The affection respect gained military serving Senate helped make relationship State Pentagon less fraught usual — although Defense Secretary Gates' insistence need bigger State Department budgets hasn't hurt. In fact, relations Pentagon gone smoother, times, Clinton's relationship White House staff. Clinton particularly irritated ridiculously strict vetting process thwarted favored candidate USAID director, Paul Farmer, getting job. "It sorts niggling things," says Clinton adviser, "like, Farmer one point brought $10,000 cash Haiti. The money needle-exchange program, amount illegal." Another Clinton's military mentors, retired General Jack Keane, told me, "I'm Republican. I disagree practically everything, she'd make hell Commander Chief." There palpable toughness woman, hard edge contrasts President's instinctive impulse toward conciliation. One sharpest exchanges presidential campaign came Obama accused Clinton echoing "bluster" George W. Bush said U.S. would able "obliterate" Iran used nuclear weapons Israel. Clinton's edgier tone evident start Administration: took sharper position President Israeli settlement freeze claiming, May, Obama wanted "to see stop settlements. Not settlements, outposts, natural-growth exceptions." And then, Jerusalem, use word unprecedented seemed rhetorical leap beyond No Drama ground rules.(Read "Clinton's Collateral Damage.") The White House entirely thrilled either statement. But White House staff several steps removed negotiating process. The Palestinians weak divided. The Israelis difficult, always: whenever Mitchell raises East Jerusalem talks Israeli Foreign Minister, Israeli stands walks room. Despite Netanyahu's momentary, tactical enthusiasm peace talks, Likud Party always favored de facto incorporation Palestinian lands state Israel. Hillary's Choice The tensions White House State raise fascinating question going forward. Obama Clinton substantive agreement President's diplomacy-first philosophy policy issues — although neither willing disclose content private conversations — style often predicts substance foreign policy; neither Obama's gauziness Clinton's inconsistent bluntness overseas seems particularly solid. There growing perception Administration's policies thwarted across board: Afghanistan mess, Iran seems ready scuttle nuclear negotiations, there's progress Middle East, Syrians North Koreans remain recalcitrant, Russians offered freebie missile defense, Chinese given pass human rights apparent quid pro quos. The White House argues progress made: Iran defensive, North Korea said return six-party talks. Clinton argues, correctly, need "strategic patience." But thing Obama really show efforts far Nobel Prize Potential — small thing — wisdom refrained anything wildly stupid invading Iraq. The President willing use military force - Predator drones decimated al-Qaeda's leadership testify lack squeamishness — Administration supposed efficacy using subtler expressions of.U.S. power. That doesn't happen overnight, Obama's policies considered success, happen sooner later, way explained public. There also growing sense President's inexperience beginning show — overall policy, represents views broad, moderate national-security consensus ranging Brent Scowcroft John Kerry, execution details. The Afghan strategy review public taken long; Middle East peace hunt become wild goose chase. A letter Iran's Supreme Leader productive gesture gets response; doesn't, seems weak supplicatory. A call Israelis freeze settlements effective accompanied credible threat reduction aid. "You can't seen pushing countries around — demanding [that] Israel freeze settlements, demanding Hamid Karzai reform government — get results," says Leslie H. Gelb, author Power Rules. "The leaders countries tough, successful politicians, they'll begin take less seriously." (See photos 1979 revolution Iran.) Clinton unwilling acknowledge problems, staff loath admit occasional mistakes. Her praise President fulsome, aides say relationship Obama really — really — strong. But also burblings emanations Clinton's staff friends, Foggy Bottom body language, suggest need Administration produce second act Rodney King phase. And White House perplexed uncharacteristic lack discipline indicated Clinton's occasional overseas gaffes. These tensions well within boundaries normal, creative policymaking. There absolutely indication Secretary frustrated point jumping ship — returning politics candidate governor New York, rumored. Quite contrary, seems intent making history Secretary State. To that, though, authority home abroad. She become President's primary foreign policy voice. Over first nine months Obama Administration, seven different Obama officials spoken Sunday talk shows foreign policy. Clinton Sunday shows once. "Either one person sending foreign policy message, clear approval President," says former Republican Secretary State, "or message."(See photos eight months Obama's diplomacy.) Aides Obama say would like see Sunday shows often. (Indeed, Clinton's staff acknowledged asked appear two additional times traveling unable so.) Ultimately, though, television metaphor larger questions need resolved: How much former rivals — extremely guarded private people — really trust other; and, Clinton, emerge President's alter ego foreign policy? At point, strongest member Obama's national-security team Gates — he's Republican unlikely spokesman presidential confidant anything beyond Pentagon issues. General Jim Jones settled National Security Adviser, he's political animal — every President needs close foreign policy adviser understands intersection long-term strategy, politics diplomatic chess. Clinton's value Administration clear Pakistan. She wowed public skeptical questioning $7.5 billion purely economic humanitarian aid Administration promised. "How much damage control able trip?" asked Meher Bokhari, television-news-show host, end Clinton's meeting Pakistani women. The Secretary seemed nonplussed bluntness question. "I don't know," said. "I hope some." Afterward, I asked Bokhari answer question. "Well, trip long overdue," said. "The Pakistani people really needed talk American concerns — strings attached aid programs, drone attacks, history support military dictatorship. And needs followed up. But ask damage control" — paused, thinking — "I'd say lot. She accomplished lot." In end, though, Clinton's success determined whether expand role beyond public diplomat. She become sure-handed negotiator and, important, trusted adviser President knows wants go world hasn't quite figured get there.
