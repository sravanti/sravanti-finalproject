Maybe. And, course, worth effort. Without effort, two state solution dead; failed, hand, also dead. Another idea, don't know made work: How introduce Israel entering NPT ending nuclear ambiguity, state policy, model Iran now. Can issue used profitably negotiations, wild card, were? Can options developed whether can, might work, potential effect peace process? Israel's nuclear ambiguity policy certainly big issue coming given Iran.

By Nia. tasha Mozwvava Tags: Israel news Avner Cohen senior fellow James Martin Center Nonproliferation Studies Monterey Institute International Studies. He author "Israel Bomb" forthcoming "The Worst-Kept Secret: Israel's Bargain Bomb." Avner Cohen, claim time come Israel abandon policy nuclear ambiguity. Why now, would good Israel? "Nuclear ambiguity cornerstone Israeli strategic thinking. It born many years ago, sealed part comprehensive deal United States 1969. It appropriate time, today. opinion, anachronistic, foolish anti-democratic. Even realpolitik terms, 'own goal' Israel. In view, undermines genuine Israeli interests, including need gain recognition legitimacy counted among responsible states strategic field." Are sure pressure Israel severe? If Israel criticized nuclear program, usually marginal. The brunt criticism treatment Palestinians. • "Israel received tacit consent nuclear program Western world appeared small, state' surrounded enemies, memory Holocaust still fresh. Israel's image different then. "In long term, Israel appears reject peace one opposes two-state solution, perceived regional bully possesses nuclear weapons. So world lot less forgiving nuclear issue. The situation ambiguity, don't real legitimacy, good place be." The United States called Israel join nonproliferation treaty, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama said recognizes special nature threats Israel faces, threats warrant special security measures. The Americans want appear fair issue seen Israel completely sacred. They want look though respect that. This agreement [with U.S.] passed along president president, I don't believe issue sacred Americans Israelis." Do give credence slippery slope theory, abandoning ambiguity would lead demands Israel disarm? "Those cliches used defense establishment. Nobody 'demands Israel make announcement without first preparatory work among allies Arab states. This great fear slippery slope ridiculous. Israel interests; nobody coerce things." What claim ambiguity keeps Arab states feeling need launch arms race Israel? "I don't dismiss claim hand, if, study thought, fear turns warranted, I would prepared wait. But ways, ambiguity insulting Arabs. The claim mention treats Arabs though children: If told Israel doesn't admit it, frees need deal reality. I believe Arab countries don't want play game make-believe, rather want discuss topic directly realistically." You say, basically, Iran imitating Israel's nuclear behavior. That comparison would certainly rankle Israel supporters. "But way Iran advanced toward nuclear capability via announcements tests, rather rumors. It even remain within bounds Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. If rankles anybody, let rankle. "If Iran attacked, want achieve status ambiguity; I see nearly certain. The international community thus another reason accept idea ambiguity legitimate. The norm state nuclear weapon must say clearly part nonproliferation regime. The longer Iran continues path, less patience world Israel." How envision scenario 'coming nuclear closet?' "Censorship plays central role enforcement nuclear ambiguity. So long [military] censor, hard alter ambiguity. If censorship didn't exist, israeli newspapers would able write subject openly. "Another issue need law addresses nuclear topic. There Shin Bet [security service] law, law Mossad law Israel Atomic Energy Commission. This problematic situation. "On international level, it's sensitive subject demands preparatory work. Ultimately, I see political statement Israel's government prime minister would find right way put subject table. He would talk historical background responsible way Israel dealt topic. With rare exceptions, weapons military use; Israel views means deterrence. I don't think Israel would need go detail regarding many [bombs] exactly has. "Israel right bomb less New Delhi, even United States. Ambiguity creates sense sinners, though done something terrible can't tell awful truth - I don't think awful. This country world viewed nuclear state long time, time come say something positive huge, complicated awe-inspiring topic... "All states ultimately committed treaty signed achieve world without nuclear weapons. Whether happen lifetimes I can't say." You say ambiguity undermines Israeli democracy prevents debate matters life death, question whose finger button. Do think Israeli public ready discussion? "There little creative thinking area, ambiguity one stifling factors produced unacceptable, closed culture incapable creative thinking. Ambiguity's power derives fact Israeli society accepts it, seems public attempt deviate would cause serious damage Israeli security. "Ambiguity created public incapable dealing topic, one afraid prefers issue handled 'trustworthy hands' take responsibility itself. Ambiguity created ignorant, craven public.which, certain sense, betrayed civic, democratic duties subject." What's like researching topic nobody discusses? "When I started studying subject 25 years ago, I feeling I entering palace nothing could touched. It took years find right way handle topic responsibly - researcher's perspective, standpoint someone directly involved matter. Today I think possible initiate meaningful dialogue concrete, real issues." • Print Page • Send friend. • Comments • Share • Text Size -1-1: • Follow us Twitter • Become Haaretz.com Faceboolr friend This story by: • atasha Mozoovaya
