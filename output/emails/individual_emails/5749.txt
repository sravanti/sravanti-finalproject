HRC: Below oped National Security Strategy I wrote tomorrow's Outlook. Unfortunately, give horrible title, I think piece turned alright. Best, Sandy By Samuel R. Berger Samuel R. Berger, chair global strategy firm Albright Stonebridge Group, served national security advisor President Clinton 1997 2001. President Obama's National Security Strategy, released White House Thursday, tackles delicate unavoidable question: How respond new old security challenges era financial distress home reordering political power abroad? For time now, clear definition U.S. national security strategy needs rethinking. The September 11 attacks, global economic crisis, cyber-terror threats even environmental catastrophe Gulf underscore challenges America faces 2010 changed even decade ago. And America's military supremacy certainly risk, new international arrangements - shift G-7 club powerful nations G-20, incorporates emerging nations China Brazil - needed costs benefits stable international order shared. The United States cannot solve global threats without others, bear burden alone. Enter National Security Strategy. In experience, congressionally mandated documents easily become laborious impenetrable, mere compendiums bureaucratic pleading various parts government. (Make sure right Japan! Don't step Pentagon!) The challenge, President Clinton insisted upon advisers, provide strategic framework clarifying rest world informs administration decision makers line. It's blueprint action, means convey president's principles priorities. In Obama's case, new sober comprehensive 52-page strategy incorporates new realities breaks past strategies several key respects. But also reflects understanding face enduring challenges - nuclear proliferation, terrorism regional conflicts - best response return fundamentals. One fundamental strength economy. At time after-effects financial crisis fiscal burden two long wars raised fears overextended America, administration makes case economic technological renewal crucial underpinning U.S. security. The president made case West Point speech last weekend. "At time human history," said, "has nation diminished economic vitality maintained military political primacy." Another fundamental challenge arms control nuclear proliferation. By seeking strategic arms cuts Russia, president returned long bipartisan tradition languished prior administration. And convening global summit securing nuclear material spring, Obama given new urgency global purchase effort started 1991 Sens. Sam Nunn Richard Lugar first initiated program lock nuclear materials. On terrorism, strategy builds past, breaks well. Presidents Clinton, Bush Obama deployed America's tools: military power, homeland defense, law enforcement, sanctions, intelligence vigorous efforts cut terrorist financing. But critical difference Obama strategy rejects Global War Terror lens prior administration viewed challenge. "This global war tactic - terrorism - religion - Islam," new strategy says. "We war specific network, al-Qaeda terrorist affiliates." This sharper focus avoids alienating many Muslim world, ensures support key allies never accepted broader construct avoids overreactions led us forsake fight al-Qaeda fight Afghanistan turn efforts unrelated threat Saddam Hussein's Iraq. In perhaps dramatic departure strategy predecessor, Obama administration restored less provocative policy use military force. In 2002 national security strategy, President Bush articulated rationale preemptive war weeks seeking U.N. resolution invade Iraq. The new strategy restores principles guided administrations decades: use force last resort, weigh costs benefits, much international support possible. The administration reserves right act unilaterally - example al-Qaeda allies - resurrects principle President Clinton often described "together possible, alone necessary." President Obama's critics focused diplomatic engagement hostile states like Iran North Korea. The President sets forth rationale: "to create opportunities resolve differences, strengthen international community's support actions, learn intentions nature closed regimes, plainly demonstrate public within nations governments blame isolation." In case Iran, Washington's outstretched hand resulted Iran's compliance. But attempts engage helped ensure world's attention focused Iran's intransigence rather Washington's refusal negotiate. Without doubt, gaps principle practice. Despite Obama administration's stated goal doubling exports next five years, put muscle behind trade agreements South Korea, Panama Colombia. And clarity call respect human rights times muted face tough realities. Sixteen months administration much progress, many true tests strategy lie ahead. In strategy's conclusions, Obama administration evokes even earlier era, calling political parties restore cooperation common purpose crucial success dark days Cold War. Despite intense debates time nuclear arms control, Central America d√©tente, nearly American supported containment communism. In spirit, administration's framework deserves broad bipartisan support. We argue differences detention prisoners, methods disarm dangerous states, hard push democratic rights, costs climate change legislation. But time, rally around overriding U.S. foreign policy goals spelled strategy: renewing economy home ensure leadership abroad; defeating al-Qaeda; succeeding Afghanistan; preventing nuclear proliferation; curbing climate change; promoting international order enlightened self-interest, economic prosperity fundamental values upon America based.
