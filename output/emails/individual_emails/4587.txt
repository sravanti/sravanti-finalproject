Wilson Courage Consequence: Less Memoir Than Hoax Karl Rove's book Courage Consequence less memoir hoax. The chapters relate CIA leak scandal yet another attempt deflect attention central role betrayal Valerie Plame Wilson's identity covert CIA officer. His distortions fabrications consistent approach throughout sordid criminal affair. Wasting opportunity tell truth, offers absolutely nothing new, selective use facts quotes transparent effort continue long campaign confuse people, unfortunately consistent past behavior. His book pathetically weak defense disastrous policies pursued Bush administration, involving country war choice based false intelligence badly tarnishing good name United States America. Nothing Karl Rove's book refutes facts. His book, however, illuminating exposing political methods, especially reliance personal insults, simply towards Valerie myself, also towards opposed unprincipled behavior. If additional proof irrefutable historical record needed, Rove's book demonstrates actions vindictive, angry petty man. Karl Rove betrayed nation; betrayed history.
