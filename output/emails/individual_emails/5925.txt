OLUMNISTS JVlartin Wolf Obama cautious fearful times By Martin Wolf Published: Au• ust 31 2010 22:48 j Last updated: August 31 2010 22:48 Suppose US presidential election 1932 had, fact, taken place 1930, early stage Great Depression. Suppose, too, Franklin Delano Roosevelt won then, though landslide 1932. How different subsequent events might been. The president might watched helplessly output employment collapsed. The decades Democratic dominance might happened. On chances wheel history turns. But time different: crisis brought Barack Obama power close beginning economic collapse. I (among others) argued policy needed hugely aggressive. Alas, not. I noted February 4 2009, beginning new presidency: "Instead overwhelming fiscal stimulus, emerging small, wasteful ill-focused." A week later, I asked: "Has Barack Obama's presidency already failed? In normal times, would ludicrous question. But normal times. They times great danger. Today, new US administration disown responsibility inheritance; tomorrow, it. Today, offer solutions; tomorrow become problem. Today, control events; tomorrow, events take control it. Doing little far riskier much." This right. The direction policy wrong: policymakers — though economists — learnt great deal 1930s. Sensible people knew aggressive monetary fiscal expansion needed, together reconstruction financial sector. But, Larry Summers, Mr Obama's chief economic adviser, said: "When markets overshoot, policymakers must overshoot too". Unfortunately, administration failed follow excellent advice. This allowed opponents claim policy ineffective merely inadequate. In consequence, administration lost credibility public chances renewed fiscal expansion disappeared. With Federal Reserve cautious, too, likelihood lengthy period weak growth heavy joblessness high. So, too, chances domestic global political friction. True, idea policies adopted last months Bush administration first months one far better nothing weirdly controversial US. A recent paper Alan Blinder, former vice-chairman Fed, Mark Zandi Moody's argues critics wrong. They use standard macro-economic model assess would happened without intervention, without financial interventions (including monetary policy) without fiscal action. They conclude peak trough decline gross domestic product would close 12 per cent policy response, compared actual decline 4 per cent (see chart). Similarly, unemployment rate would peaked 16.5 per cent, instead actual 10 per cent. The bigger collapse would also meant fiscal deficit $2,600bn fiscal year 2011. The outcome also disastrous modest fiscal response financial •olic res•onse. It little better way round. The implication modest stimulus package February 2009 — mere 5.7 per cent 2009 GDP, spread several years — made positive contribution supported analysis Congressional Budget Office: argues 2010, US GDP 1.5 per cent 4.1 per cent higher unemployment rate 0.7 1.8 percentage points lower, result package. Panglossians believe private economy always equilibrium, unless governments intervene, disagree. I wish way run experiment without hurting hundreds millions people. But I find idea allowing collapse much financial system, avoiding unconventional monetary policy struggling close fiscal deficit would consistent rapid sustained recovery quite bizarre. A fascinating perspective come, however, comparisons happened advanced countries. The recession US output (and demand) relatively small, decline employment exceptionally large, result extraordinary surge US productivity (see charts). This contrast would happen output would happen employment missed initial Congressional Budget Office analysis stimulus. Since US epicentre financial crisis, relatively small decline output remarkable. Moreover, since fiscal monetary stimuli bear directly demand output, jobs, policy success. At time, enthusiasm US managers laid workers also extraordinary. No doubt, due collapse construction. But must due ease US companies lay workers incentives managers maintain profits downturn expense jobs. Debate emerging much surge unemployment structural. My answer, European experience, one way ensure becomes structural let linger. In short run, simplest way prevent happening expand demand output. Since huge slack labour market, slightest threat inflation — far risk deflation — constraint bond foreign exchange markets monetary fiscal stimulus, policies pursued. Yet, alas, Fed seems decided fall asleep administration lost initiative. So going happen? I assume that, midterm elections, resurgent Republicans offer new tax cuts ignore fiscal deficits. They pretend nothing reviled stimulus, though much thing — increasing fiscal deficits, thereby offsetting private frugality. That would put administration spot. It would choose vetoing tax cuts accepting them, allowing Republicans get credit "yacht mansion-led" recovery. Any recovery better none. But could much better this.
