March 15, 2010 Op-Ed Columnist Taking On China By PAUL KRUGMAN Tensions rising Chinese economic policy, rightly so: China's policy keeping currency, renminbi, undervalued become significant drag global economic recovery. Something must done. To give sense problem: Widespread complaints China manipulating currency — selling renminbi buying foreign currencies, keep renminbi weak China's exports artificially competitive — began around 2003. At point China adding $10 billion month reserves, 2003 ran overall surplus current account — broad measure trade balance — $46 billion. Today, China adding $30 billion month $2.4 trillion hoard reserves. The International Monetary Fund expects China 2010 current surplus $450 billion — 10 times 2003 figure. This distortionary exchange rate policy major nation ever followed. And it's policy seriously damages rest world. Most world's large economies stuck liquidity trap — deeply depressed, unable generate recovery cutting interest rates relevant rates already near zero. China, engineering unwarranted trade surplus, effect imposing anti-stimulus economies, can't offset. So respond? First all, U.S. Treasury Department must stop fudging obfuscating. Twice year, law, Treasury must issue report identifying nations "manipulate rate exchange currency United States dollar purposes preventing effective balance payments adjustments gaining unfair competitive advantage international trade." The law's intent clear: report factual determination, policy statement. In practice, however, Treasury unwilling take action renminbi unwilling law requires, namely explain Congress isn't taking action. Instead, spent past six seven years pretending see obvious. Will next report, due April 15, continue tradition? Stay tuned. If Treasury find Chinese currency manipulation, what? Here, get past common misunderstanding: view Chinese us barrel, don't dare provoke China dumping dollar assets. What ask is, What would happen China tried sell large share U.S. assets? Would interest rates soar? Short-term U.S. interest rates wouldn't change: they're kept near zero Fed, won't raise rates unemployment rate comes down. Long-term rates might rise slightly, they're mainly determined market expectations future short-term rates. Also, Fed could offset interest-rate impact Chinese pullback expanding purchases long-term bonds. It's true China dumped U.S. assets value dollar would fall major currencies, euro. But would good thing United States, since would make goods competitive reduce trade deficit. On hand, would bad thing China, would suffer large losses dollar holdings. In short, right America China barrel, way around. So reason fear China. But do? Some still argue must reason gently China, confront it. But we've reasoning China years, surplus ballooned, gotten nowhere: Sunday Wen Jiabao, Chinese prime minister, declared — absurdly — nation's currency undervalued. (The Peterson Institute International Economics estimates renminbi undervalued 20 40 percent.) And Mr. Wen accused nations China actually does, seeking weaken currencies "just purposes increasing exports." But sweet reason won't work, what's alternative? In 1971 United States dealt similar much less severe problem foreign undervaluation imposing temporary 10 percent surcharge imports, removed months later Germany, Japan nations raised dollar value currencies. At point, it's hard see China changing policies unless faced threat similar action — except time surcharge would much larger, say 25 percent. I don't propose turn policy hardball lightly. But Chinese currency policy adding materially world's economic problems time problems already severe. It's time take stand.
