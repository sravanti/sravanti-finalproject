Below Economist blogger re efforts wil EU discredit Ashton, particularly French. Wouldn't hurt mention positively French interlocutors. See particularly line: "There is, frankly, whiff old boy's network Lady Ashton: lifetime member honourable guild former foreign ministers, surrounded men suits think know lot foreign policy does. There much sympathy complicated family life, involving young children, much commuting Brussels Britain." A blog author column European Union Charlemagne's notebook . Why Lady Ashton take EU's foreign policy job? â€¢ Jan 26th 2010, 22:04 NOT yet February, briefing Catherine Ashton, newly appointed EU foreign policy chief, getting nasty. Jean Quatremer, Brussels blogger well-connected EU correspondent Liberation, dropped another depth charge baroness tonight. His list complaints long, I feeling smidgeon exaggerated. I find hard believe literally impossible reach Lady Ashton eight o'clock evening Mr Quatremer charges, allegedly mobile telephones diverted EU situation centre (a small intelligence analysis cell staffed officers national servicies) hour. I also doubts stress laid fact yet got round top secret security clearance yet, cannot see confidential papers. As former British cabinet minister, serving UK commissioner, something tells British least may share odd secret her. A senior official I saw today also made point holder Lady Ashton's post would currently struggling teething problems squabbling new foreign policy apparatus created Lisbon Treaty takes shape. There is, frankly, whiff old boy's network Lady Ashton: lifetime member honourable guild former foreign ministers, surrounded men suits think know lot foreign policy does. There much sympathy complicated family life, involving young children, much commuting Brussels Britain. Finally, risk sounding loyal British, I think Mr Quatremer unfair says suits Foreign Office London Lady Ashton "sabotage" post. My impression aritich nnvornmpni- fPPlc I (iv Achtnn nePdc lot sunnort riaht worries getting enough support, time worries receives much help way briefings advice British officials, seen British stooge. That may self-serving sort fear (because allows British offer Lady Ashton lots help) real enough. Other charges probably something them. They certainly chime things I told people. But damaging, mind, intimate nature briefing: stuff coming officials close Lady Ashton, senior enough significant contact her. And I confirm conversations people across whole EU foreign policy machine asking question: take huge job, instinct seems make low key possible? That dangerous question mark hanging you.
