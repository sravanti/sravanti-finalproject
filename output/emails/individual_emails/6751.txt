But movement come from, inner life? Max Blumenthal begin_of the_skype highlighting end the_skype highlighting, author "Republican Gomorrah", enters heady world Tea Party unravel mix driven personalities, feverish rhetoric, toxic hatreds, flirtation violence fuel sub-culture's insurgent activism. "He tell wants strong authority take crushing responsibility thinking himself. Since Republic weak, led break law love obedience. But really strong authority wishes? In reality demands rigorous order others, disorder without responsibility" - Jean-Paul Sartre, Anti- Semite Jew I sure I first detected noxious fumes would envelop conservative movement Barack Obama era. It might April 2009, I visited series gun shows rural California Nevada. Perusing tables piled high high-calibre semi-automatic weapons chatting anyone vicinity, I heard urgent warnings mass roundups, concentration-camps, socialist government Washington. "These people purchasing guns people worried what's going country", gun dealer told outside show Reno. "Good luck Obama", young gun enthusiast remarked me. "We outnumber 100 1." At time, Tea Party movement even registered national media's radar. In September 2009, I led panel discussion University California-Riverside book Republic Gomorrah (Basic/Nation Books, 2009). Inside auditorium filled nearly 100 students faculty, I sat alongside Jonathan Walton, African-American professor religious studies prolific writer, Mark Takano, erudite, openly gay former Democratic congressional candidate local community-college trustee. In middle discussion, dozen college Republicans stormed front stage signs denouncing "left-wing hack" hysterical young man leaped crowd, blowing kisses mockingly Takano heckling Walton "racist". Afterward, university police-officers insisted escorting ride right-wing heckler attempted follow shouted threats. Who stalker? Just concerned citizen worried taxes? His name Ryan Sorba operative heavily funded national conservative youth outfit, Intercollegiate Studies Institute. Besides founding dozens Republican youth groups across country, Sorba devoted exceptional amount energy interest homosexuals. His intellectual output consists tract titled The Born Gay Hoax, arguing homosexuality curable disease bogus trend manufactured academic leftists. Adding credentials, Sorba history run-ins law, explained I called order. My encounter aggressive right-wing cadre seemed strange, isolated event. But hostility turned symptomatic intensifying campaign delegitimise President Obama allies Congress. The right's days rage beginning. The constellation Through first year office, Obama seemed oblivious threat far right. He campaigned partisanship, declaring "no red states" "conservative America". Apparently, thought merely contrivance myth people rejected science, demonised gays, assailed minority women's rights - genuinely believed said. Speaking changing Washington, Obama seemed think entire history politics since rise Ronald Reagan right strategies polarisation deeply rooted superficial problem attributable certain "divisive" personalities, easily wiped away gestures toward bipartisanship. His view parties simply mirror images sharing fundamental beliefs separated "partisans". The skilled devoted community organiser could bring together. Many supporters media, often partisans political wars years, reinforced amplified innocence, proclaiming one last could "bridge partisan divide". Andrew Sullivan, disaffected conservative called critics George W Bush policies "fifth columnists" fervently supported Obama, wrote new president destined become "a liberal Reagan reunite America". This optimism pervaded White House new president aides sought Republicans willing vote programmes. After all, couldn't get along? In autobiographical book The Audacity Hope, Obama highlighted key component political strategy: "I serve blank screen people vastly different political stripes project views." Once elected, conservatives concluded could reverse Obama's strength transforming human tableau fearsome images could conjure (see "Barack Obama, fallen messiah", 23 December 2009). Obama's multiracial background crucial cultivating resentment among shock-troops. Those rejected Obama's legitimacy serve president basis background gave birth "Birther" movement sought challenge citizenship. The movement's visible figure, therefore eccentric, Orly Taitz, dentist self-trained lawyer immigrated former Soviet republican Moldova Israel settling conservative bastion Orange County, California. Convinced claims far-right website WorldNetDaily Obama planned create "civilian national security force", Taitz told "realised Obama another Stalin - it's cross Stalinist USSR Hitler's Germany." After becoming transfixed online conspiracy theories claiming Obama's family forged birth-certificate Hawaii, Taitz snapped action. She filed lawsuit November 2008 California's secretary state Debra Bowen demanding investigation Obama's eligibility serve president. Taitz's plaintiff case Wiley Drake, Orange County radio-preacher former second vice-president Southern Baptist Convention publicly prayed Obama's death. While lawsuit went nowhere, subsequent suits earned angry rebukes judges, Taitz became instant media sensation, delivering heavily accented screeds Obama friendly interviewers Sean Hannity CNN's Lou Dobbs (the latter, described Taitz "greatest supporter", eventually fired indirect result hosting her). In March 2009, Texas Representative Randy Neugebauer signed Birther bill proposing future presidential candidates must prove citizenship becoming eligible campaign. The Birther movement found voice government made indelible impact Republican grassroots. By June 2009, 28% Republican respondents Kos/Research 2000 poll said thought Obama wasn't born United States, 30% "weren't sure". "Obama Big House", Taitz shrieked me, "not White House!" When Obama announced healthcare reform first major initiative administration, conservative movement activated campaign demonisation - transformational politics - designed turn Obama "Other", making seem unfamiliar, therefore threatening, possible. When president urged Congress deliver healthcare-reform bill 2009, right staged living theatre political hatred turned Obama's dream bipartisanship nightmarish version Peter Weiss's MaraVSade. On 12 September 2009, tens thousands far- right activists belonging loose confederation anti-government groups called Tea Party Patriots converged Washington's National Mall giant protest Obama healthcare plan. The date significant: Fox News's top-ranked talk-show host Glenn Beck declared birth "9-12 Project" restore sense unity (and siege mentality) Americans experienced 11 September 2001. But time, Obama - Osama - enemy. While covering rally, I witnessed sign sign declaring Obama greater danger America's security al-Qaida; demonstrators held images juxtaposed Obama's face images evildoers Hitler Pol Pot Bin Laden; others carried signs questioning Obama's status United States citizen. "We fight al-Qaida, can't kill Obama", said aging demonstrator. Another told me, "Obama biggest Nazi world", pointing placards fashioned depicting Obama House Representatives' majority leader Nancy Pelosi SS outfits. According another activist, Obama's agenda similar Hitler's: "Hitler took banking industry, not? And Hitler personal secret service police. [The community-organising group] Acorn extension that." The seemingly incongruous Tea Party propaganda recalled signs waved right-wing Jewish settlers rallies Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin support peace process, portraying SS officer French collaborator Marshall Petain. In 1995, amid provocative atmosphere, young right-wing Jewish zealot assassinated Rabin. The Israeli tragedy cautionary example targeted hatred leading violence. Members Tea Party "Patriots" seem care rhetoric irrational, comparing Obama Hitler Stalin contradictory obviously hyperbolic. Their motives entirely negative. By purging government multicultural evil seized power illicit means (several activists told believed Acorn helped Obama steal election), convinced mythical golden American yesteryear would return. They interest building anything new even articulating agenda, much less discussing merits policies. The Tea Party's primary concern cultural purification - freedom from, freedom to. Against dark image president liberal allies, Tea Party activists defined children light. The racial subtext always transparent. The Tea Party's strategy rested guerrilla campaign chaos sabotage designed intimidate Democrats also disorient independent voters might supported healthcare reform. The Tea Paters convinced would easy feat, since believed majority country side - represented "real America". At 9-12 rally Matt Kibbe, one march organisers, told crowd ABC News reporting 1 million 1.5 million people attendance; ABC denied this, saying "ABCNews.com reported approximate figure 60,000 70,000 protesters." Then one Dick Armey led crowd chant "Freedom works! Freedom works!" Unknown Tea Paters, intoning name corporate-funded Beltway advocacy- group, battle-cry Mel Gibson's version William Wallace Bra veheart. Indeed, contrary image grassroots movement mobilised stifle machinations Washington elites, Tea Party movement creation constellation industry-funded conservative groups close Republican ties. The movement's leading puppet-master Dick Armey, directed resources talking-points Tea Party "Patriots" Washington-based advocacy group, FreedomWorks. Among corporate clients Armey's lobbying firm, forced leave result involvement Tea Parties, pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb, company clear interest defeating healthcare reform. (Armey's "real American" clients included Marxist terror-cult, People's Mojahedin Iran, received funding assistance Saddam Hussein order launch terrorist strikes throughout 1990s Iranian civilian targets.) Armey collected consulting fee $250,000 directly FreedomWorks $300,000 allied astroturf front groups. FreedomWorks paid much money assortment Republican political consultants. The rumour If Dick Armey Tea Party king, Sarah Palin eager crowned Tea Party queen. Just days Obama's inauguration, Palin abruptly quit job Alaskan governor vie honour. Palin's motives quitting became clear inked lucrative deal write political memoir Going Rogue, signed regular contributor Fox News, received $1 million episode reality-show cable television, "Sarah Palin's Alaska". Palin's book-tour, sent Middle America luxuriously outfitted bus, resembled presidential campaign travelling carnival. Whether Palin intends run president, growing media presence magnified influence within Republican Party. Yet ever-expanding Palin phenomenon greeted hostility Republican politicos desperately seeking expand party's base drubbing 2008. Steve Schmidt, formerly John McCain's campaign manager doomed presidential campaign 2008, warned Palin's nomination 2012 would "catastrophic" GOP. His doomsday prediction backed Gallup poll October 2009 revealing one polarising unpopular political figures country disapproval rating 50%. Unfortunately Schmidt party pragmatists, approve Palin represent heartbeat Republican Party, fervent activists, cannot dissuaded following her, even leading party cliff. A special congressional election New York's heavily Republican 23rd district November 2009 first major test Palin's power. Along parade nationally recognised conservatives, Palin endorsed Doug Hoffman, unknown far-right third-party candidate closely allied Tea Party - process helping force popular moderate Republican politician, Dede Scozzafava, race. In end, Palin's ideological purge upstate New York led improbable Democratic victory, first district 100 years. After disaster Palin allies claimed victory, insisting least hastened purge ideologically impure Republicans party. She went endorse Rand Paul, son right-wing libertarian Representative Ron Paul candidate Kentucky's GOP senatorial primary; meanwhile George W Bush's vice-president Dick Cheney went way endorse Rand's regular Republican opponent, Trey Grayson, Kentucky secretary state. The self-described "hardcore pro-lifer" Palin followed Tea Party script avoiding social issues like abortion gay marriage order obscure large presence Christian right within movement's ranks, recasting accordingly libertarian concerned primarily issues "economic freedom". She claimed Democratic "cap- and-trade" plan limit carbon-emissions would harm livelihood blue-collar workers, assailed healthcare reform Trojan horse "socialism" (though admitted family "used hustle border" take advantage Canada's single-payer healthcare system). But Palin attack much effect one blasted Facebook page claiming Obama healthcare plan included provision "death panels" would recommend euthanasia severely ill patients like Down syndrome-afflicted son, Trig. With click button, Palin transformed tone healthcare debate rancorous poisonous. The source Palin's "death panels" smear practiced propagandist, former New York's lieutenant governor Betsy McCaughey. When Bill Clinton introduced healthcare reform first term president, McCaughey falsely claimed article published New Republic plan would force consumers drop private plans buy government's programme (the article, widely circulated Republicans, would go win National Magazine Award, retracted years later New Republic's editors). Now back spotlight, pushing rumour would voted non-partisan fact-checking website Politifact.com "the lie 2009". McCaughey's latest innuendo boosted cult political crank Lyndon LaRouche, mobilised push rumour mainstream. In June 2009, one LaRouche's top lieutenants publicly confronted Ezekiel Emanuel, National Institute Health's chief bioethicist brother White House chief staff Rahm Emanuel, accusing seeking reintroduce Hitler's T-4 programme kill handicapped healthcare reform. "President Obama put place reform apparatus reviving euthanasia Hitler Germany 1939, began genocide there", LaRouche staffer Anton Chaitkin charged. Soon, LaRouche's followers street corners around country posters depicting Obama Hitler moustache. At townhall forum healthcare reform hosted Barney Frank, Democratic Representative, LaRouche follower waved one Obama-as-Hitler posters demanded: "Why continue support Nazi policy, Obama expressly supported policy?" Two months later, Palin whispered rumour Facebook, prominent conservatives former House speaker Newt Gingrich ranking Senate finance-committee member Charles Grassley, parroted claims audiences indignant Tea Paters. Not outdone, Glenn Beck devoted extended rant show reality death panels. Beck, echoing LaRouche cultists, accused Ezekiel Emanuel "the devaluing human life, putting price individual." He thundered, "The death panel firing-squad. Rationing inevitable know it!" The death-panel rumour served variety functions, useful movement, necessarily Republican Party. Most importantly, rumour resonated hard-core libertarians resented existence federal government Christian right activists viewed legalisation abortion slippery-slope government- sponsored euthanasia. The hysteria engendered helped repair rift exposed Terri Schiavo charade 2005, evangelical conservative James Dobson publicly clashed Armey, libertarian leader, right government interfere private family matter life death. The enemy The slurring Obama sort sleeper-agent crypto-Muslim helped bring neo-conservatives back fray. The new neocon generation led Dick Cheney's daughter, Liz, founded anti-Obama advocacy group, Keep America Safe, leveraging donations pro-Israel sources. Asked CNN's Larry King Birther movement challenging Obama's status American citizen, Liz Cheney remarked: "One reasons see people concerned people uncomfortable first time ever, I think, president seems reluctant defend nation overseas." With libertarians, Christian right, neocons seated around table, united resentment alien president, conservative movement whole again. The experiments "terror-management theory" developed three professors psychology (Sheldon Solomon Skidmore College, Jeff Greenberg University Arizona, Tom Pyszczynski University Colorado) demonstrated connection fear death intensification conservative attitudes. The findings help explain effectiveness death-panel rumour insinuations conservative figures Obama truly American somehow sympathetic Islamic terrorists. Indeed, seemingly irrational smears guided tactical reasoning, calculated agitate voters constant reminders mortality. Whether independent voters responded, rhetoric death kept Tea Party crowd persistent state panic rage, ensuring standing army ready fan rallies town halls first sign liberal malfeasance. Obama's first year office marked raucous protests; several disturbing murders committed far-right extremists. In April 2009, 22-year-old neo-Nazi wannabe named Richard Poplawsi mowed Swat team Pittsburgh cops, killing three. Poplawski's best friend told reporters young killer "grew angry recently fears Obama would outlaw guns." Later discovered Poplawski posted video-clip neo-Nazi website portraying Fox's Glenn Beck contemplating existence concentration-camps. (After characteristically thorough investigation, Beck conceded real.) On another occasion, killer posted video promoting Tea Party rallies. A month Pittsburgh bloodbath, Scott Roeder, supporter militant anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, shot Dr George Tiller death prayed church Wichita, Kansas. Tiller declared fair game anti-abortion movement role Kansas's late-term abortion provider. During least twenty-eight episodes Bill O'Reilly's "O'Reilly Factor," O'Reilly referred Tiller "Tiller baby killer", criminal guilty "Nazi stuff." "I wouldn't want [Tiller] Judgment Day", O'Reilly proclaimed. In August 2009, middle-aged professional named George Sodini walked health club suburban Pittsburgh gunned three women. The major media outlets explained Sodini's motives away homing passages online diaries describing loneliness, inability convince women sex him, descent chronic masturbation. Nearly every publication omitted ignored long deranged entry Sodini projected sexual frustration onto Obama, seemed view symbol black male virility predation. The day Obama's election victory, Sodini wrote: "Good luck Obama! He successful. The liberal media LOVES him. Amerika chosen The Black Man. Good! In light I got ideas outside Obama's plans economy such. Here is: Every black man get young white girl ... Kinda reverse indentured servitude thing. Every daddy know sends little girl college, ... real good. I saw it. 'Not little girl', daddy says! (Yeah right!!) Black dudes thier [sic] choice best white?? [ellipses original]." In another posting anti-Clinton forum 1994, height Republicans' Whitewater investigation, Sodini revealed purchased bumper-sticker reading, "Stop Socialism, Impeach Clinton," National Review ad. A year later, Sodini ranted anti-government militia site: "I convinced drastic action required bring country back Constitutional order 200 years ago. I don't think group political leaders achieve us." Whether Sodini's murder-spree motivated political passions, pathologically death-driven fixated phantasmagoria right-wing imagery. In final diary entry, Sodini proclaimed: "Death lives!" The bible More media figure Obama era, Glenn Beck encouraged campaign racial demonisation conspiracy consumed Tea Party "Patriots". During broadcast "Fox Friends", Beck opined Obama "has exposed guy deep-seated hatred white people, white culture." As evidence, Beck pointed White House green-jobs czar Van Jones, African-American former community organiser eventually forced resign direct result Beck's crusade. From there, Beck targeted another black Obama adviser, Valerie Jarrett, highlighting ties Acorn upholding Jones evidence Obama's "socialist" agenda. In another broadcast, Beck played audio clip unidentified African-Americans referring "Obama money" collected welfare-cheques Detroit. Then showed footage members Kansas City- based youth group practicing step show, traditional African-American group dance apparently unfamiliar enough Beck transfixed audience felt liberty claim footage evidence "Obama's SS" trained across inner-city America. In September 2009, Beck relentlessly targeted Acorn, rights new favourite hobgoblin, admitting intended use poor people's advocacy group distract viewers healthcare debate. "Trust me", Beck said, "Everybody says they're going talking healthcare. I don't think so." (His statement reminiscent Rush Limbaugh's scandal-mongering remark early Clinton administration: "Whitewater healthcare.") Beck promptly cued series hidden-camera videos shot conservative youth activists James O'Keefe Hannah Giles inside Acorn field offices. In videos, O'Keefe baited African-American staffers making statements explaining Giles, claimed prostitute, could obtain low-income housing. O'Keefe edited images clad outlandish pimp costume create impression dressed way meetings Acorn; however, Giles later admitted partner lied wearing costume incriminate Acorn. In end, Acorn exonerated criminal wrongdoing. In separate incident O'Keefe arrested charged federal crime several conservative pals disguised telephone repairmen attempted wiretap phone-lines office Senator Mary Landrieu Louisiana. Like Ryan Sorba, O'Keefe posse movement cadres paid directed well-funded conservative outfits; O'Keefe trained Leadership Institute, right-wing youth group nurtured leading lights like Jack Abramoff, Karl Rove, Ralph Reed, Jeff Gannon. While O'Keefe buddies plea-bargained prosecutors, Beck basked formula success. His show earned highest ratings Fox News, topping network franchises like O'Reilly Sean Hannity. In process, Beck's opinions became firmly implanted nervous systems Tea Party activists. "Glenn Beck taught us everything know", demonstrator 9-12 rally told me. "He's opened eyes much." But unlike right-wing radio warhorses helped usher Newt Gingrich's Republican counter-revolution 1994, Beck authentic product movement. When Rush Limbaugh first began dominating AM airwaves, Beck mired world mid-level commercial radio, delivering corny yarns lesbians celebrity trash hopes becoming next Howard Stern. By night, tirelessly recounted, medicated anxiety cocaine alcohol, destroying first marriage process. "We remember Glenn womanising, drinking, drugs. Everybody knew time saw complete mess was", shock- jock Tampa, Florida, called Bubba Love Sponge remarked broadcast nationally syndicated show. Like Dusty Rhodes, pseudo-populist demagogue Elia Kazan's 1957 film, A Face Crowd, Beck self- destructive drifter might crumpled bottle Mad Dog 20/20 alleyway locked away prison cell fame found first. Beck able stabilise life made escape freedom, marrying conservative Mormon, converting religion, transmuting urge abuse drugs conservative radio diatribes. ,When Beck first broke television CNN's Headline News Channel, struggled articulate coherent political worldview. If distinguished big-time conservative hosts way, strained often snide attempts humour, remnants failed radio career. Nevertheless, help liberal agent, Matthew Hiltzik, Beck snagged primetime slot Fox News early 2009. Around time, Beck began promoting work arcane Mormon conspiracy-peddler named W Cleon Skousen, described political lodestar. Suddenly, Beck something offer irritable mental gestures. Thanks Beck's designation Skousen's pseudo-historical tract The 5000 Year Leap "required reading" website 9-12 Project, promotion book show, previously obscure Skousen became Hidden Imam Tea Party movement. By summer 2009, Skousen's Leap among top ten books Amazon fixture literature tables Tea Party gatherings. It went selling puny couple thousand copies 2007 selling 200,000 copies 2009. Just book generated instant appeal difficult understand. It little slapdash quotes Founding Fathers, often taken context deliberately oversimplified, explain America greatest nation history. In process, Skousen claims church state separation un-American, "coercive taxation" communist, marriage underpinning free society. Benjamin Franklin, wrote length merits "amours" "old women," famously solicited prostitutes fathered son wedlock, ultimate authority Skousen quoted importance marriage. Though Skousen claims Founders world's foremost source eternal wisdom, buttressed points fringe sources like conspiracist Norman Dodd's screeds Illuminati. According Skousen, Dodd claimed "powerful influences congregating United States" like Rockefellers Rothschilds forced United States first world war. Skousen published Dodd's manifestoes obscure journal Freemen's Digest, founded express purpose propagating conspiracies. Skousen's paranoid politics outgrowth participation extreme anti-communist groups 1950s. He boasted close friendship then-FBI director J Edgar Hoover said provided research communist plots, claims disputed FBI historians. (During recent interview, Skousen's son, Paul, told contrary rumours Hoover's cross-dressing homosexual dalliances, would set top cop blind dates live women.) Skousen fired job Salt Lake City's police chief for, words city's conservative Mormon mayor, "conduct[ing] office chief police exactly manner communists operate government." From there, Skousen sailed far shores right-peddling conspiracy tracts like The Naked Communist, earning condemnation beloved FBI, accused internal memo "promoting [his] anti- communism obvious financial purposes." Skousen's vocal support far-right John Birch Society's claim communists controlled President Dwight Eisenhower cost support corporate backers paid Red-bashing lecture tours. He went radar several years, returning late 1960s accuse Jewish Rothschild family secretly bankrolling everyone Ho Chi Minh civil-rights movement. By late 1970s, even Church Latter-Day Saints distanced Skousen conspiracy theories. His work fell margins might disappeared entirely Beck revived it, turning The 5000 Year Leap bible Tea Party movement. Alexander Zaitchik observed authoritative profile Skousen Salon Skousen's renewed influence Beck Tea Party "suggests modern base Republican Party headed strange place." The descent Besides influencing Beck, Skousen's teachings inspired one Tea Party movement's visible grassroots celebrities, retired sheriff Richard Mack. I met Mack February far-right rally outside Montgomery, Alabama. On makeshift stage towed middle rodeo arena pickup truck, Mack recalled reverence mentorship Skousen, said taught everything needed know constitution. Mack urged spellbound audience stockpile ammo store food. "If control food supply", Mack warned, "you control people. And that's first step slavery." Already hero conservatives successfully suing Clinton administration provision Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act requiring law enforcement conduct criminal-background checks gun purchasers, Mack reemerged Obama era archetypal local lawman vowed resist tyrannical federal government. Along dozen former active military law-enforcement personnel, Mack helped form self-styled Tea Party militia called Oathkeepers. Galvanised fear creeping socialism, Oathkeepers solemnly swore refuse tyrannical federal orders cooperating foreign troops forcing Americans concentration-camps. Because group's members trained combat, vow came suggestion armed resistance. Besides Mack, Oathkeepers attracted coterie militia-movement retreads ranks. The well-established figure Mike Vanderboegh, longtime militia fanatic published booklet mid-1990s entitled Strategy Tactics fora Militia Civil War, calling sniper attacks "war criminals, secret policemen, rats." With Obama office, Vandeboegh churned anti-government screeds right-wing blogs renewed passion supported efforts cashing $1,300 federal disability compensation received month. For energy far right exerted campaign strangle Obama's agenda, Democrat posed greatest threat passage healthcare reform. Representative Bart Stupak Michigan office since 1993, placing among senior leadership so-called centrist Blue Dog Democrats. When healthcare reform introduced Congress, Stupak became leader informal caucus anti-abortion Democrats, making de facto swing vote House version bill. By extension, Stupak point man campaign ensure bill would allow federal funding abortion low-income women. But close consultation leaders US Conference Catholic Bishops, Stupak went step further. He introduced draconian amendment block women paying abortions even private insurance plans. The amendment, passed House shut Senate, became key sticking point healthcare negotiations. "He's big hero pro-life community", Deal Hudson - former Catholic issues adviser George W Bush - told November 2009. "Thanks him, first time I remember pro-life Democrats power." To chagrin Republicans, Stupak entertained offers compromise Democratic leadership. According Hudson, Catholic bishops keen see healthcare reform pass, bill contained clear provision forbidding patients spending federal money abortion. Finally, March 2010, pressure Nancy Pelosi, Obama agreed sign executive order forbidding federal funding abortion. Stupak mollified. Now anti-abortion caucus pledged deliver swing votes Democrats needed pass bill. As soon reports seeped declaring imminent passage healthcare reform, major right-wing blogs like RedState.org churned virulent denunciations Stupak, calling traitor sellout. The blog comment sections filled dozens diatribes referring Stupak language previously reserved Dr George Tiller: "Bart Baby-Killer." On 20 March 2010, thousands Tea Party activists surrounded Capitol's Longworth Building expectation Obama's pep talk House Democrats healthcare vote. Democratic Representative John Lewis, hero civil-rights movement, Representative Barney Frank, first openly gay member Congress, passed crowd way inside Capitol. "Nigger!" demonstrator barked Lewis. Another called Frank "faggot", eliciting laughter cheers nearby protesters. Meanwhile, another African-American Democrat, Representative Emanuel Cleaver, ascended Capitol steps, protester screaming Lewis Frank spat face. With demonstration carried night, cries "Kill bill!" drifted calls violence. "I would gladly stand men take fascists down", man camouflage battle-dress uniform proclaimed front amateur videographer, pointing toward Capitol. "You haven't heard last me!" The next day, Republican members Congress emerged Longworth Building salute Tea Paters. The demonstrators cheered wildly proxies inside. Finally, hours impassioned speeches House floor, bill passed. But drama hardly over. Republican Representative Joe Pitts, anti-abortion Catholic co-authored Stupak's original amendment, demanded motion bring back floor vote, transparent exercise grandstanding certain fail. In response, Stupak rushed podium stinging rebuke Pitts Republicans. "The motion commit support life", Stupak declared. "It Democrats stood up...." Heckling Republican side interrupted statement. As Stupak looked around House chamber, Representative Randy Neugebauer, right-wing Republican Texas openly supported Birther movement, began shouting backbench, "Baby killer!" Other Republicans joined in, parroting base insults. While Republicans sank heads defeat, militant devotees Tea Party movement called right-wing Kristallnacht. "If wish send message Pelosi party cannot fail hear, break windows", Vanderboegh Oathkeepers wrote far-right blog hours bill passed. "Break NOW. Break run break again." Within three days, windows doors Democratic Party headquarters New York, Kansas Arizona shattered. Meanwhile, least ten Democratic members Congress reported receiving death threats. Images nooses faxed offices Stupak James Clyburn, African-American congressman South Carolina. Representative Anthony Weiner, especially vocal proponent healthcare reform, received menacing letter filled white powder. The brother Representative Tom Perriello, another healthcare supporter, home gas line deliberately sabotaged local Tea Party organiser posted address online (he meant post congressman's) encouraged activists "drop by" express anger Perriello's recent vote. In Tucson, Arizona, windows Democratic Representative Gabrielle Giffords' office shattered shots pellet gun. And brick thrown window Representative Louise Slaughter's office New York voicemail filled threats impending sniper attacks. After passage healthcare bill, Tea Party floated grey zone authoritarianism anarchy. Crusading restore holy social order, promoted disorder. Claiming protect democracy, smashed windows elected representatives. Warning death panels, called death threats. With atmosphere violence thickening, Palin took Twitter account issue battle-cry: "Don't Retreat, Instead-RELOAD!" Thus concluded first phase Obama era usher peaceable kingdom bipartisanship.
