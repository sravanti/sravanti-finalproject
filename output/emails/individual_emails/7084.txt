Keith Richards Has Memories Burn By JANET MASLIN It 3 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time New York office Keith Richards's manager, place might look ordinary every wall shelf crammed world's glorious rock 'n' roll memorabilia. Mr. Richards 3 o'clock appointment. "Come in, he'll minute," assistant says — comes minute, 3:01. This man prided operating Keith Time, in: security staff ate shepherd's pie Keith wanted dressing room? Then everyone packed stadium bloody well wait. The Rolling Stones don't play another shepherd's pie shows up. Chalk promptness man's new incarnation: Keith Richards, distinguished author. True, far rock star turn memoirist, far Rolling Stone write book — much himself. The raven-haired Ron Wood wrote "Ronnie," described Brian Jones "me blond wig." Bill Wyman, band's retired bass player bean counter, wrote "Stone Alone," 15-shilling demo disc went unmentioned. Now Mr. Richards written keeper: "Life," big, fierce, game-changing account Stones' nearly half-century-long adventure. "It's difficult thing I've ever done," says book. "I'd rather make ro records." But sounds anything weary. And seems refreshed, bearing surprisingly little resemblance battered, kohl- eyed pirate Keith Richards looks like 50 miles bad road. Today, neutral street clothes hot-green shoes, positively debonair. On hands: ubiquitous silver skull ring, swollen knuckles, thin white scar hunk steaming phosphorus burned finger bone played concert without stopping. On head: headband raffish, straw-colored hat, gray tufts poking directions. Not single gewgaw hangs it. "I've phase," says. "Don't know hair take pressure anymore." He's quite lot phases. And they're page "Life": Boy Scout (really); tyro rocker; lovestruck kid (mad Ronnie Spector, unbeknownst Phil Spector); astonished new star; heroin-addicted older one; jaded veteran countless world tours; longtime sparring partner Mick Jagger. (Despite tabloid shock bickering book, two seriously calling names least since early 198os.) All recounted straight-up candor, easily sensationalized. But book's single biggest stunner hand-written note jacket flap: "Believe not, I haven't forgotten it." How, asked, humanly possible man well known stupefaction "Satisfaction?" "I think main concern beginning whether memory really reliable," says. "Fox little sleuthing." Fox James Fox, journalist author "White Mischief," Mr. Richards's friend many years collaborator putting "Life" together. (It sold Little, Brown & Company reported advance $7 million.) Mr. Fox wound researching Mr. Richards's past, conducting interviews knew long ago drawing upon wonderfully candid old letters journal entries. "Spent day practising," 19-year-old Mr. Richards wrote January 1963, Stones beginning play public. "Worthwhile, I hope!" Also exhumed: 1962 letter Mr. Richards Aunt Patty describing boy known primary school, Mick Jagger. He signs "Luff/Keith XXXXX" These artifacts turned Richards equivalent Proust's madeleines, though Mr. Richards, whose reading taste runs naval history novels Patrick O'Brian George MacDonald Fraser, would hardly put way. In case prompted recollections never expected rediscover, "Life" began click. Once stories told draft written, Mr. Fox wound sitting together separate copies manuscript Mr. Fox read B6 whole book aloud. "What I couldn't guess he'd good natural editor," Mr. Fox, reached e- mail, says Mr. Richards. "He cut, accordingly, pace rhythm — real musical cut." As calling book "Life," Mr. Richards editing too. "My Life" book called. "I said 'I tell what, cut 'My,' you've got title," says. He might appropriately used another title likes, "Keep It Dark." But, says, "I'm saving song." The contents "Life" dark enough already. The book begins 1975 drug bust Arkansas judge persuaded free Mr. Richards confiscating hunting knife (which still hangs courtroom) picture taken him. How Mr. Richards get lucky? "I really can't explain it," says, deadpan, now. "Maybe I've got honest face." It covers many arrests too, well Mr. Richards's grueling efforts kick heroin addiction, claims done successfully 30 years ago. "Stories like aren't told much," insists. "There aren't many people willing tell them." Then health hazards book describes. Like electrocution. "My spectacular one Sacramento. ..." says smile, drifting fond-sounding reverie involves guitar string touching ungrounded microphone clouds smoke billowing mouth. He good laugh memory finding hospital hearing doctor say, "Well, either wake don't." "Life" already attracted undue attention schoolyard-sounding anatomical swipe Mr. Jagger. But book pulls punches, disses serious that. "Cold-blooded" "vicious" two printable words uses describe Brian Jones. Allen Ginsberg "old gasbag." Mick Taylor, former Rolling Stone, "didn't anything" left band, Donald Cammell, film director ("Performance," starring Mr. Jagger Anita Pallenberg, Mr. Richards's longtime lover partner crime), couldn't commit suicide quickly enough suit Mr. Richards. (He shot 1996.) When Marlon Brando propositioned Ms. Pallenberg, Mr. Richards remembers replying this: "Later, pal." As Mr. Jagger, complaints deep-seated. They involve credit hogging, social climbing, egomania, insecurity, unethical business behavior — comes Freudian's holiday anyone who's ever watched bare-chested young Jagger Richards vamp together — uncertain sexual identity. There's also cool condescension Mr. Jagger's contributions duo's songwriting. And nasty nickname two, like "Disco Boy." In conversation this, Mr. Richards emphatically blase: "It's bound somewhat rough, point I'm trying tell story Day 1 now," says. And sure: "There's odd conflict there. But weigh out, things count nothing." Mr. Richards see Mr. Jagger knew book ahead time. "The important thing me," says, "was Mick seen knew what."And anything one Stone say another Stone really give offense point? "No." But anything new said Stones anyway? As "Life" emphatically demonstrates, answer yes. And surprisingly revelatory material appears Mr. Richards jokingly calls "Keefs Guitar Workshop." Here secrets world's famous rock riffs almost toy-level equipment recorded, like cassette recorder onto Mr. Richards dubbed guitar layer guitar layer "Street Fighting Man," "Jumpin' Jack Flash" part "Gimme Shelter." Here's silent beats Elvis Presley's "Heartbreak Hotel" worked way Mr. Richards's inspired solos. Mr. Fox found "Heartbreak Hotel" key Mr. Richards's best musical memories. Some well known music critics. But Mr. Richards makes fascinating layman's level. And surprised find early readers haven't skipping musicology, even though book cordially invites so. What finds gratifying written "Life" chance readers grasp breadth range book's material. He rare memoirist say, without hyperbole, "that I hoped worth sharing people turned far important I could possibly imagine." It's getting late. Time leave bright orange room Mr. Richards's name emblazoned director's chair; assorted music awards platinum records everywhere; there's discreet little skull middle wall mirror; Louis Vuitton guitar case — ad Vuitton — parked corner. But items likeliest catch eye ones coffee table: loose cigarettes neatly arrayed holder, lighter, cigarettes pack. "Do mind I smoke?" asked first appeared. Easy one: Who, aside Keith Richards certain legal authorities, ever kept Keith Richards anything? But hour gone by, hasn't touched cigarettes. He hasn't even looked them. He done one thing make resemble sullen, haunted, diabolically beautiful creature cover book, one hellfire blazing hand meet blurry white thing he's smoking. "That?" says innocently asked picture. "Oh, that's lighting cigarette. That's I doing."
