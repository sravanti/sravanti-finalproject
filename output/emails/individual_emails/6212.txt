November 2010 Declaring America's Stand Middle East Peace By Chester A. Crocker, Scott B. Lasensky Samuel W. Lewis Faltering Middle East peace talks need jolt. Washington powerful option moving process forward: taking firm stand end conflict. An American declaration principles—carefully crafted properly marketed--could spark debate thereby change political calculus leaders. As mediator world power, one America's strongest assets ability legitimize ideas rally others support. A central role U.S. conflict must define zone negotiability. This mean imposing peace. Rather, would statement basic principles U.S. believes guide parties toward negotiated solution. America long declared support "two states," must say means practice. Even current talks resume, without American ideas parties unlikely agree broad trade-offs necessary reach peace deal. A quick deal "borders security," many proposed, unlikely without Washington addressing end-game. Otherwise, sides would exposed issues set later discussion, like Jerusalem refugees. Opinion polling consistently showed support peace strongest core issues addressed. An American statement principles would mobilize regional support. It would provide, first time, public framework engaging sponsors Arab Peace Initiative. It would also strengthen ability reassert importance regional support structure bilateral negotiations, especially reviving multilateral contacts meetings involving Israelis neighbors throughout region. Moreover, greater regional engagement peace process carry powerful benefits regional challenges like Iranian nuclear program. A clearer U.S. declaration also surest way protect prospects two-state solution unrelenting onslaught ground pushes parties away peace deal. An American set ideas would anchor present-day demands issues like Jerusalem, security settlements clear vision future. Perhaps urgently, would broaden debate narrow confines settlements question. At minimum, American declaration based 1967 lines, agreed territorial swaps; support compromise Jerusalem allows two capitals two states; include provisions security limitations guarantees; reiterate America's support agreed solution refugee problem; reaffirm long-standing commitment State Israel. But American principles also include caveat, given ultimate interest agreed, viable solution—not particular formula. What would take American ideas succeed? Unlike past efforts, Washington try 'pre-cook' declaration one parties choreograph reactions. In fact, U.S. statement principles would explicitly described country believes support; implication cannot support. Thus, U.S. statement would designed achieve immediate approval adoption parties. Its purpose would clarify America stands, define interests work for. It would aim influencing climate thinking region, sobering illusions encouraging need support. Timing context course key considerations. Assuming current gridlock negotiations persists, time must elapse election results digested, abroad, public attention redirected toward foreboding increasingly dangerous Arab-Israel stalemate. A presidential speech essential dramatize seriousness purpose lay principles. It immediately followed major, high level diplomatic effort persuade key Middle East leaders Quartet UN allies genuine desire regionalize peacemaking effort. To maximize support key members Congress, speech occur Congress adjourns. No consultation stalemated parties beyond routine precede speech, leaks contents must kept absolute minimum purpose undermined. The speech could usefully also remove veil silence shrouds breakthroughs past negotiations; example, progress Annapolis process. As substance, endorsement two-state solution comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace, Obama Administration hinted Palestinian settlement also accompany normalized relations Israel Arab states, putting broader framing around traditionally defined conflict Israel immediate neighbors. The normalization piece puzzle fully articulated part new strategy based presenting American ideas parties. It way entice skeptical Israelis, also leads back long overdue need Washington engage Arab Peace Initiative. If U.S. puts forward peace principles, American leadership ensure diplomatic process defined clear picture possible parties expect gain negotiated settlement, never gain without one. Skeptics say risky present American ideas parties, would pull rug current leaders, exposing withering domestic criticism. Others argue galvanize obstructionists, support compromise, could well precipitate crisis ground. Others simply worry cost American prestige key players react negatively. But risks overstated, complete collapse process would far dangerous, particularly strategic environment shifts favor regional forces seek undermine, rather promote peace. America must limit managing conflict often upended shared interests peace stability. END Chester A.
