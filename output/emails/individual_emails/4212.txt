http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article6991697.ece From The Times January 18, 2010 Fear poor hampering Haiti rescue American views rule among rubble Port-au-Prince. That's one reason aid taking long get need Linda Polman Aid workers already baptised earthquake Haiti "historical disaster". It rate high annals humanitarian aid world number victims scale destruction. But rescue operation also becoming notorious slowness aid reaching victims. Five days quake hit, many places still largely bereft international aid. Not lack funds, supplies emergency experts. Those pouring dozens countries. But aid — aid workers — seems stuck airport. Rescue teams pulled survivors five-star hotels, university buildings, supermarket UN headquarters, Port-au-Prince's better neighbourhoods. In poor areas, damage appears much greater, apparently forgotten victims report Twitter yet encounter first foreign rescuer. Many aid workers reported orders venture without armed guards — all, long debates UN military command. The UN lost number staff quake, keen risk lives. But Haitian people seem scare aid workers Somali warlords, Darfuri Janjawid Afghan Taleban. Frightened Dutch aid workers abandoned mission without•reaching collapsed building people trapped, frightened doctors left patients unattended. The experience CNN's medical reporter, Dr Sanjay Gupta, telling. In makeshift clinic encountered Belgian medical team evacuated UN bus. UN "rules engagement" apparently stopped providing security doctors. The Belgians took medical supplies them, keep claws robbers. Dr Gupta camera team stayed night, monitored abandoned patients' vital signs continued intravenous drips — robbed. Some rescuers leaning much toward security allow people die. The media helping. CNN rules rubble. "Outside military conflict, biggest international deployment since tsunami 2004," according Tony Maddox, managing director CNN International. So image aid operation beamed back primarily Ameridan — one big problems American view Haiti. CNN won't stop telling aid workers outside world pillaging (the incidence — first four frustrating days least — compare happened Hurricane Katrina) dangerous distribute food, likelihood "stampedes". Nor US Government, biggest player aid operation, anything help relax atmosphere. On contrary. When President Obama said US aid effort would "aggressive" meant it. The humanitarian operation led civilian agencies, Pentagon. Mr Obama ordered 9,000 troops fleet nuclear-powered ships move in. Victims war Congo (which cost five million lives past years) genocide Darfur would love much American attention — Haiti's fate lay America's backyard sore American eyes decades already. One, perhaps even two million Haitians already live United States, try come. Every day dead Haitian refugees wash Miami's sunny beaches. Haiti constant pain US taxpayers feel billions dollars poured least lifted country position one poorest places Earth. Even earthquake struck, investigations taking place fate several million dollars aid funds, sent victims hurricane hit Haiti 2008, disappeared. Furthermore, horror many godfearing Americans, voodoo officially recognised religion Haiti. And, perhaps all, Haitians poor black. In view Americans two add ... murderous gangs. The invasion soldiers humanitarian workers airport Port-au-Prince reminds American military invasion Haiti authorised President Clinton 1994. I'd lived worked almost two years correspondent Dutch radio. There 20,000 soldiers surprisingly nervous reception unarmed Haitians might store them. It turned wave slum dwellers streaming air sea port greet American guests. In abundant conga lines snaked city, tea cosies heads express happy were. "Liberte! Merci Beel Cling Dong!" shouted. A terrified American GI, still teenager, saw mass pitiful creatures approaching him, asked tea cosies "some kinda voodoo?". He calmed line BMWs Mitsubishis appeared filed past watch invasion. Where soldier came from, owners vehicles like respectable citizens. In Haiti, likely ones smuggling drugs making US aid dollars disappear. The good guys Haiti defenceless people slums. For Western city dwellers, world turned upside down. "Back! Back!" soldier shouted, aiming weapons good guys. The rescue teams stay put airport one reason still don't really know going on. Seventy survivors pulled rubble far, International Red Cross said Sunday. That's 14 rescues per day joint result 1,739 international specialised rescue workers there. That number would surely jump professional equipment brought made available countless groups local people desperately digging victims bare hands, day night. Let's hope food distributors worrying safety know yesterday hundreds people Port-au-Prince dropped knees praying outside warehouse workers agency Food Poor announced would distributing rice beans. The crowd allowed children elderly go first line without guns aimed first. Linda Polman's War Games: The Story War Aid Modern Times published Penguin April
