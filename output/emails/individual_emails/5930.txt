H: Pat Lang's view resumed talks. Sid ."IsraePaestinialpeace talks expected resume Se4zitember" Washst "The Middle East peace process resumed May, hiatus 19 months, stalled terms moving indirect talks, mediated U.S. envoy George Mitchell, direct negotiations. .israel insists ready direct talks, provided preconditions. The Palestinians ready provided clear agenda. Israel says agenda means preconditions. Resolving snag terms crucial, diplomats say." Washpost The former NY Times reporter Judy Miller likes address "gloomy gus" thing I encounter her. Well, stand gloom. The second Camp David talks failed Dennis Ross company placed Palestinian delegation position "solution" demanded expected Americans Israelis basis bargaining negotiations themselves. This seemed reasonable time US Israeli negotiators. After all, one does? Should outcome product dialectic argument persuasion? Arabs generally think not. They tend believe negotiations purpose arranging details outcomes understood advance conference itself. For them, anything else attempt win concessions trickery. "The Palestinians ready provided clear agenda. Israel says agenda means preconditions." Hello! What kind nonsense this? Have learned nothing? And then, "little" matter non-participation Hamas. Does Obama Administration really think 600 pound gorilla ignored? Is sort scheme part Natanyahu, "the boys" discredit Abbas isolated Hamas attacked destroyed later? Realism diplomacy desirable thing. George Mitchell used smarter this. His staff advising this. Failure catastrophic. All players engaged, not. The outcome known advance not. This childish destructive. pl http://www.washiLigtorsost. cortilwp-dyn/contentiarticie;2010/0811 9/AR201 0081 907203 htrni
