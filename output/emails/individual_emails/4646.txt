FYI Kristof's OpEd From Today's NY Times. April 22, 2010 Op-Ed Columnist Obama Backs Down Sudan By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF JUBA, Sudan Until reached White House, Barack Obama repeatedly insisted United States apply pressure Sudan avoid humanitarian catastrophe Darfur elsewhere. Yet, president, Mr. Obama aides caved, leaving Sudan gloating American weakness. Western monitors, Sudanese journalists local civil society groups found month's Sudanese elections deeply flawed - yet Mr. Obama's special envoy Sudan, Maj. Gen. Scott Gration, pre-emptively defended elections, saying would "as free fair possible." The White House showed hint backbone hurried reference week "an essential step" "serious irregularities." President Omar Hassan al-Bashir Sudan - man wanted International Criminal Court crimes humanity Darfur - celebrating. His regime calls National Congress Party, N.C.P., quoted Sudan telling rally Blue Nile region: "Even America becoming N.C.P. member. No one will." Memo Mr. Obama: When man charged crimes humanity tells world America pocket, it's time review policy. Perhaps Obama administration caved considers flawed election better election. That's reasonable view, one I share. It's conceivable Mr. Bashir could won quasi-fair election - oil revenues manifestly raised standard living parts Sudan - campaigning create space sharp criticism government. It's also true Sudan behaving better respects. The death toll Darfur hugely reduced, government negotiating rebel groups there. The Sudanese government gave visa travel permits Darfur, allowing travel legally freely. The real game isn't, fact, Darfur elections maneuvering possible new civil war. The last north-south civil war Sudan ended fragile peace 2005, two million deaths. The peace agreement provided referendum, scheduled take place January, southern Sudanese decide whether secede. They expected vote overwhelmingly form separate country. Then question becomes: north allow South Sudan separate? The south holds great majority country's oil, it's difficult see President Bashir allowing oil fields walk away. "If result referendum independence, going war - complete war," predicts Mudawi Ibrahim Adam, one Sudan's outspoken human rights advocates. He cautions America's willingness turn blind eye election-rigging increases risk Mr. Bashir feel get away war. "They're na√Øve Washington," Mr. Mudawi said. "They don't understand going on." On hand, senior Sudanese government official, Ghazi Salahuddin, told unequivocally Khartoum, nation's capital, Sudan honor referendum results. And it's certainly plausible north south muddle avoid war, sides exhausted years fighting. Here Juba, South Sudan capital, I met Winnie Wol, 26, fled civil war 1994 militia north attacked village kill, loot, rape burn. Her father many relatives killed, escaped made way Kenya - eventually resettled refugee California. She lives Olathe, Kan., returned first time Sudan visit mother sisters last seen little girl. Ms. Wol, every bit well-dressed American, let tag along journey back village Nyamlell, 400 miles northwest Juba. The trip ended thatch-roof hut belonged mother, didn't know coming - one home. Ms. Wol crushed. Then scream woman came running. It Ms. Wol's mother, somehow recognizing her, flew other's arms. To me, felt like peace dividend. Yet peace fragile, Ms. Wol knows northern forces may come back pillage again. "I don't want war," said, "but I don't think allow us separate." My hunch north hasn't entirely decided do, strong international pressure reduce risk another savage war. If President Obama ever going find voice Sudan, better soon.
