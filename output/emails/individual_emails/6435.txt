HRC: [Huma print HRC] Melanne stepping QDDR giving specific edits section ensure integration gender. In addition help, shared thoughts/concerns reorganization affects s/GWI. We already determined earlier feedback S/GWI would maintain direct report S (I actually always thought even reorganization homes many S offices, still maintaining direct S/reporting revisiting issue writ-large next draft you. For example, know statutorily S/CT legislatively required S report). That said, narrative review speak. I embedded comments caps text graph relevant. TO: Anne-Marie Slaughter FROM: Melanne Verveer DATE: November 4, 2010 RE: Gender Integration QDDR The Secretary declared time time empowerment women "at heart foreign policy United States." Our collective task realize principle integrating gender policies programs State Department USAID enduring way. We concerned current draft QDDR falls short call. In existing draft, Office Global Women's Issues falls new Under Secretary Civilian Security, Democracy Human Rights retaining Ambassador-at-Large Global Women's Issues reports directly Secretary. This new structure misses simple important reality women half world's population major security, economic social challenges century cannot solved without them. These issues cut across work department touch virtually regions, though place special emphasis regions women girls vulnerable, countries experiencing conflict transition. Locating office within one bureau makes impossible Office implement charge — integrate gender effectively work entire State Department. Therefore, gender must integrated throughout regional functional bureaus rather located within one bureau. Women integral diplomatic efforts—from traditional bilateral multilateral relationships, strategic dialogues, public diplomacy, relations civil society, community leaders non-state actors. Women also important consider policy initiatives, including global health, food security, climate change, economic issues, human rights, peace security. We must institute rigorous institutional mechanisms ensure bureaus, regional functional, consider gender diplomacy development. In order integrate gender effectively throughout work Department, recommend following approach planning, budgeting, structure evaluation: Maintain visibility focus gender. Retain Ambassador-at-Large Global Women's Issues reports Secretary. This position embodies commitment advocacy gender equality essential part diplomacy development signals understanding important national security United States. In addition, office advances coherent coordinated strategy gender throughout State Department USAID. [DONE] Ensure gender effectively addressed throughout bureaus missions. We recommend following structural changes State. First, make Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary (PDAS) regional functional bureaus responsible accountable bureaus' work gender. The Office Global Women's Issues would serve resource PDAS issues. Second, assign specialized gender liaisons regional bureaus purposes integration, needed. Third, include training capacity development employees gender Issues (in Foreign Civil Service well political appointees). Fourth, evaluate PDAS bureau gender integration policies programs (including, example, component Performance Evaluation System). Similarly, require Chief Mission responsible accountable mission's work gender, assign personnel expertise manage work gender, require personnel receive training gender issues, evaluated work. A parallel structure put place USAID, diplomacy development work gender coordinated complimentary. [THIS IS RECOMMENDATION, WITH SOME VARIATION, MADE FOR MANY AREAS — PUBLIC DIPLOMACY, MULTILATERAL AFFAIRS, AND OTHERS — CHALLENGE WILL BE TO IDENTIFY HOW TO ADDRESS EFFECTIVELY AND CREAT A PDAS JOB THAT IS MEANINGFUL GIVEN THE NEW RESPONSIBILITIES SOUGHT TO BE IMPOSED THROUGH THAT POSITION] Include gender strategic planning budget allocation. We recommend continuing requirement initiated last year bureaus include plan gender integration annual Strategic Plan Budget proposal. Each bureau required describe policies programs improve gender equality strengthen work generally. They also required, extent possible, outline portion policies programs target affect women girls. [THIS ALREADY IS IN PLACE AND WOULD BE RETAINED] Measure impact. Develop indicators long-term evaluation systems measure impact programs women girls. There efforts underway currently within F USAID consider improve measurement impact women girls develop different additional indicators appropriate. [SAME AS IMMEDIATELY ABOVE —THIS IS ALREADY IN PROCESS] Happy discuss. cdm
