Here Republican former Secretaries State op ed, ran today's wash post. The Republican case ratifying New START bn)://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/01/AR2010120104598.html?hpid=topnews By Henry A. Kissinger, George P. Shultz, James A. Baker III, Lawrence S. Eagleburger Colin L. Powell Thursday, December 2, 2010; Republican presidents long led crucial fight protect United States nuclear dangers. That Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan George H.W. Bush negotiated SALT I, START I START II agreements. It President George W. Bush negotiated Moscow Treaty. All four recognized reducing number nuclear arms open, verifiable manner would reduce risk nuclear catastrophe increase stability America's relationship Soviet Union and, later, Russian Federation. The world safer today decades-long effort reduce supply nuclear weapons. As result, urge Senate ratify New START treaty signed President Obama Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. It modest appropriate continuation START I treaty expired almost year ago. It reduces number nuclear weapons side deploys enabling United States maintain strong nuclear deterrent preserving flexibility deploy forces see fit. Along obligation protect homeland, United States responsibilities allies around world. The commander nuclear forces testified 1,550 warheads allowed treaty sufficient missions - seven former nuclear commanders agree. The defense secretary, chairman Joint Chiefs Staff head Missile Defense Agency - originally appointed Republican president - argue New START essential national defense. We make recommendation exact timing Senate ratification vote. That matter administration Senate leaders. The important thing bipartisan support treaty, previous nuclear arms treaties did. Although us initial questions New START, administration officials provided reasonable answers. We believe compelling reasons Republicans support ratification. First, agreement emphasizes verification, providing valuable window Russia's nuclear arsenal. Since original START expired last December, Russia required provide notifications changes strategic nuclear arsenal, United States unable conduct on-site inspections. Each day, America's understanding Russia's arsenal degraded, resources diverted national security tasks try fill gaps. Our military planners increasingly lack best possible insight Russia's activity strategic nuclear arsenal, making difficult carry nuclear deterrent mission. Second, New START preserves ability deploy effective missile defenses. The testimonies military commanders civilian leaders make clear treaty limit U.S. missile defense plans. Although treaty prohibits conversion existing launchers intercontinental submarine-based ballistic missiles, military leaders say want expensive less effective building new ones defense purposes. Finally, Obama administration agreed provide modernization infrastructure essential maintaining nuclear arsenal. Funding efforts become part negotiations ratification process. The administration put forth 10-year plan spend $84 billion Energy Department's nuclear weapons complex. Much credit getting administration add $14 billion originally proposed $70 billion modernization goes Sen. Jon Kyl, Arizona Republican vigilant effort. Implementing modernization program timely fashion would important ensuring nuclear arsenal maintained appropriately next decade beyond. Although United States needs strong reliable nuclear force, chief nuclear danger today comes Russia rogue states Iran North Korea potential nuclear material fall hands terrorists. Given pressing dangers, question arms control treaty Russia matters. It matters parties' interest transparency stability strategic nuclear relationship. It also matters Russia's cooperation needed make progress rolling back Iranian North Korean programs. Russian help needed continue work secure "loose nukes" Russia elsewhere. And Russian assistance needed improve situation Afghanistan, breeding ground international terrorism. Obviously, United States sign arms control agreements make friends. Any treaty must considered merits. But agreement clearly national interest, consider ramifications ratifying it. Whenever New START brought debate, encourage senators focus national security. There plenty opportunities battle domestic political issues linked future American economy. With country facing dual threats unemployment growing federal debt bomb, anticipate significant conflict Democrats Republicans. It is, however, national interest ratify New START.
