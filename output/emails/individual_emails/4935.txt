When Nixon wanted foreign policy advice, everyone knew got from: Henry 'Kissinger, variously national security adviser secretary state. In contrast, Mr Obama big foreign policy strategist. Even insiders give different answers asked turns advice big international questions. But almost agree following observation. "The truth President Obama Henry Kissinger — one else plays role," says senior official. "Every administration reflects personality president. This president wants trains Barack Obama Great Wall China last year. Unlike predecessor Richard Nixon, turned Henry Kissinger advice, US president big foreign policy strategist routed Oval Office." Fifteen months took office, character structure Mr Obama's foreign policy machinery still evolving. But interviews dozens insiders outsiders, including senior officials authorised unauthorised speak, three former national security advisers, clear buck stops with, often floats quite long time around, Mr Obama himself. Foreigners complained tendency domestic agenda crowd international one — passage last week healthcare reform greeted audible sigh relief among US allies. But within foreign policy itself, centralised structure also result many issues left back burner awaiting presidential attention, say critics. "On positive side, conscientious president takes advice widely," says official. "On debit side, president's intelligence, Barack Obama came office little experience. He doesn't much depth issues.' The core Mr Obama's foreign policy machinery White House-based National Security Council, advises president co-ordinates activities across increasingly complex alphabet soup Washington departments, military commands intelligence agencies. The widely questioned link chain Jim Jones, whom, many people's surprise, Mr Obama brought national security adviser. Only briefly acquainted Mr Obama beforehand, General Jones, retired four-star marine corps general, shows little interest running "inter-agency" process — key part job. Somewhat unconventionally, Gen Jones travels frequently thus often town. Unusually, Mr Obama usually chairs weekly National Security Council, known "principals meeting", Gen Jones. Rahm Emanuel, Mr Obama's chief staff, also key part it. "If ask real national security adviser is, I would say three four, Rehm one Gen Jones probably least important," says another official. Anyone dealt Gen Jones speaks highly matter-of-factness, geniality respect many foreign governments — Pakistan Israel among them. But admitted rather disarmingly last year, taste bureaucracy. Speaking Atlantic Council, think-tank previously worked, Gen Jones provoked laughter said: "I fondly remember [the Atlantic Council] place people actually asked do. In new role I'm finding order basis negotiation." The lack strong national security adviser created recurring difficulties. Perhaps best example Arab- Israeli peace process, Mr Obama launched second day office appointed Geproe Mitphspil envoy. Three months later, Mr Obama insisted Benjamin Netanyahu freeze settlements activity order boost Arab confidence talks. In heated ;34.16NA(dpyin ,Clvg li..0f7;ce. last May, Mr Netanyahu refused accede Mr Obama's demand, officials present Mr Emanuel David Axelrod, senior adviser Mr Obama office campaign. Gen Jones there. The fallout put talks abeyance damped high Arab hopes Mr Obama. "The question is, bright spark advised president demand settlements freeze without working next step Netanyahu inevitably said 'No'?" says Leslie Gelb, official Carter administration former head Council Foreign Relations. "Why wasn't George Mitchell room? Where Jones?" Mr Obama's character also stamped inter-agency process, set managed Tom Donilon, deputy national security adviser. The nitty-gritty foreign policy-making done frequent "deputies' meetings", sometimes consume four six hours day. Described one insider "the powerful man White House whose name isn't widely known", Mr Donilon, official Clinton administration, man keeps Mr Obama's trains running time. And lot trains. Last year, Mr Donilon held 270 deputies meetings — workload described "clinically insane" former senior diplomat Bill Clinton. But time goes on, becoming streamlined — taking roughly two three hours day, say officials. "People forget inherited two wars, terrorism threats, perhaps biggest single eight-year decline [George W. Bush's two terms] America's power reputation history," says senior official. "It took time put place process could deal complex decisions take." Also organiser Mr Obama's 9.30arn national security briefing, Mr Donilon reinstated paper trails needed prevent intra-governmental anarchy, using model devised Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser George Bush senior Gerald Ford. Vice-president Joe Biden's team also incorporated prevent kind "parallel process" Dick Cheney used circumvent bureaucracy George W. Bush. "If look 2002 2003 meeting decision go war iraq taken, cannot find it," says senior official. "By getting process right, improving quality decisions." The deputies' ties go back years. For example, families Mr Don;Ion Jim Steinberg, deputy secretary state, often go holiday together. Mr Donilon's wife, Cathy Russell, chief staff Jill Biden, vice-president's wife. Mr Steinberg's wife, Sherburne Abbott, deputy John Holdren, Mr Obama's chief scientific adviser. All regularly attend, including Michele Flournoy, senior Pentagon official, Susan Rice, US ambassador United Nations, known since least 1993, started Clinton administration. This well, since spend half lives together: "A lot work gets done group," says Ms Flournoy. "Sometimes feels like shovelling coal keep fires going." The refurbished machinery perhaps evidence build-up Mr Obama's decision December send another 30,000 US troops Afghanistan — journey took four months involved 40 hours Oval Office meetings. But diligence process crowded Mr Obama's time focus crises — many. "Time precious commodity president has," says former national security adviser. "On average going 45 minutes day foreign policy, want make sure well spent." The widely expected departure Gen Jones end year also created rivalries within engine room. Those thought ambitions replace include Mr Steinberg, Ms Rice, Mr Donilon Denis McDonough, NSC chief staff foreign policy official personally closest Mr Obama. Although widely respected, none considered big strategic thinker Kissinger Scowcroft mould. Described Mr Gelb Mr Obama's "Lord High Executioner", Mr McDonough "has appended Chicago crowd", says another official. Mr McDonough's widely feared role highlights contradictions Mr Obama's foreign policy apparatus. Once adviser former Senate majority leader Tom Deschle, Mr McDonough frequently Mr Obama's side campaign. Insiders describe "enforcer" keeper "message discipline", key element campaign something drastically slow wheels government. "McDonough guy campaign one plays basketball president — they're close," says official. "Instead Jim Jones telling McDonough president thinks, way round." Indeed, Mr Obama's highly centralised foreign policy machine face, would Mr McDonough's. "Donilon perceived make process inclusive give everyone seat table," says David Rothkopf, former Clinton official scholar NSC. "Fairly not, McDonough perceived representing process taking place another room, among inner circle, table weren't invited." Mr Obama built machine roads lead him. On minus side, means lot lower-level meetings without decisions. It also means neglecting issues cannot squeezed diary, trade policy, continues drift; relations India, unnecessarily tense. And means fingerprints Mr Obama's political inner circle detected rumour mill even absent, president's decision begin rog,,g: witsirawal anistan. July 2011 — recommendation came Robert Gates, secretary defence. On plus side. Mr Obama sharp learning curve, means administration continues evolve. On plus side also, White House-centric, perhaps better Sun King than, say, Nixon George W. Bush. "At end meeting, president summarises everyone said arguments made real lawyer's clarity," says participant NSC principals meeting, includes Mr Gates Mrs Clinton. "When president finally makes decision, full facts usually shows high calibre judgment." When Mr Obama makes decision, is. STATE AND DEFENCE DEPARTMENTS An 'alliance unsackables' finds confront inner circle If caveat depiction Obama administration White House-centric, alliance Hillary Clinton Robert Gates, president's secretaries state defence. Mrs Clinton proved one surprises Barack Obama's tenure, forging strong working relationship former rival establishing chief foreign policy spokesperson internationally — home, Mr Obama's inner circle often seems monopolise explaining. Mr Gates, recently decided stay least another year, seen unsackable, least credibility lends issues ranging missile defence Guantanamo Bay Afghanistan. As holdover Bush administration, national security bona fides hard dispute. It coincidence Mrs Clinton probably unsackable cabinet member. The combination made felt administration's significant debates, notably Afghanistan, successfully urged deployment troops. "Gates Clinton happen like other, one really predicted," says one official, notes traditional role NSC "play referee" state defence departments, often nowadays combination two White House. This different worked Donald Rumsfeld Colin Powell held positions. "We work together well," Mr Gates said appearance Mrs Clinton CNN last year. "I think starts with, frankly, based experience, secretary defence willing acknowledge secretary state principal spokesperson United States foreign policy." Their outlooks often overlap. From Pentagon, Mr Gates long called US spending diplomacy. As chief diplomat, Mrs Clinton adopted muscular approach. On Iran, favour tough sanctions; Russia, sought reassure Moscow's neighbours even improving relations Kremlin. But workmanlike co-operation, escaping fact Mrs Clinton part Obama inner circle — traditionally helpful feature job. There also constant "residue friction" Mr Obama's Mrs Clinton's teams, according insiders. For example, Cheryl Mills, Mrs Clinton's chief staff, several run-ins others administration. One official describes Mrs Clinton "totally loyal" Mr Obama. He adds: "She president best friends — could be? But totally respects presidency — married president wanted one ... She still might be."
