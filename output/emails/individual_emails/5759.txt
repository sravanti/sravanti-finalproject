First observation: Bibi's Entebbe reverse. The father, Benzion Netanyahu, 100 years old, secretary Jabotinsky, denounced radical Begin, adored son Yoni, heroically killed Entebbe. Benyamin never measured up. Benzion constantly criticized public deviations doctrine Greater Israel. Bibi desperately seeks father's approbation never equal dead brother. See Benzion's recent scathing undermining son Bibi Bibi's tearful tribute brother last month. The raid ship Gaza resembles raid Entebbe, except hostages, guns, it's Africa, it's fiasco; otherwise, it's Entebbe. (Then, there's Ehud Barak reliving youth raider killing Palestinians Lebanon, feat memorialized Spielberg's film, Munich. Ultimately, didn't work well time either. The film captures moral quandaries, appear escaped participants.) Further observation: The international press inquire whether Obama administration gave wink nod Bush administration Lebanon Gaza incursions. Be prepared. Further: Of course, consequences US foreign policy national security negative across board: analogy North Korean ship sinking Chinese posture support Iranian sanctions, etc., etc. Did Israelis hear Petraeus's testimony? Further: Of course, whatever outcome raid, one inevitable ones would death peace process, is, eve Bibi's scheduled visit Obama, would been, circumstance, light raid, profoundly humiliating president. Or Israelis bone stupid? I don't think so. Cheers, Sid Like Father, Like Son? Netanyahu's Father Says Son Not Serious About Two-State Solution.
