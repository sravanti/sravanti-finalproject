sbwhoeop Wednesday, September 8, 2010 2:35 PM H: First review speech. Goad used Acheson. Sid aary's Homerun Speech Tunku Varadarajan September 8, 2010 I 12:16pm Clinton speaks Council Foreign Relations September 8, 2010 Washington, , DC. (Mark Wilson / Getty Images) The secretary State delivered best speech Obama administration morning. Tunku Varadarajan "new American moment"—and she's better boss. Behold Hillary Doctrine. And heap abundant gratitude—and rose petals hand—on firm, unfussy, deeply reassuring woman offered world. In 20 months since administration began administering (a verb I use loosest sense), speech Wednesday morning Hillary Clinton, delivered Council Foreign Relations, first time given unreserved lift heart members. It was, far, best speech administration. Whereas president frequently wrung elegant hands, rounds world reassure foreign leaders America cuddly bunny heart, secretary State declared Wednesday living "a new American moment—a moment global leadership essential." There bowing potentates robes; was, instead, promise "we everything exercise traditions American leadership home abroad." What piquant fact Hillary understands Obama president. It growing sense Hillary would made much, much better president Obama. Try size: "The United States can, must lead new century." In order that, Clinton promised "a new global architecture," "built last withstand stress." And muscular departure way administration—for fear seeming Bush-like—has shrinking unembarrassed propagation American values, uttered plainspoken, unadorned words: "Democracy needs defending." X Human rights, too, came robust airing: China scolded, exhorted follow "the rules road" aspiration great power; Russia, invasion Georgia. The message: We may live multipolar world, higher standards far would style equals. Clinton used phrases like "American might," words accustomed hearing Republicans—words we've come believe many Democrats can't bear voice. How refreshing, therefore, reach vocabulary pride American citizens would applaud. Hillary Clinton invoked name Dean Acheson reference need "good, old-fashioned diplomacy," certainly air Achesonian, statesman, speech. Good, old-fashioned diplomacy, noted, contrast Obama's apparent preference seeing America nation like other, bit bigger, richer, better-armed. Clinton's "old-fashioned" diplomacy based, contrast, unquestionable premise America world's leader. Not primus inter pares; primus. In speech, Clinton referred sources "American might." The first, course, "economic power." But hailing second—America's "moral authority"—that invigorating. It Acheson said: "The important aspect relationship president secretary state understand president." What piquant here, administration, fact, plain behold, Hillary understands Obama president. It growing sense Hillary would made much, much better president Obama. Tunku Varadarajan national affairs correspondent writer large The Daily Beast.
