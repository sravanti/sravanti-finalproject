OPINION DECEMBER 7, 2010 New Start: Ratify, With Caveats The treaty helpfully reinstates on-site verification Russian nuclear forces, senators make clear Moscow don't see limiting U.S. missile defenses. By CONDOLEEZZA RICE When U.S. President Bush Russian President Putin signed Moscow Treaty 2002, addressed nuclear threat reducing offensive weapons,-as predecessors had. But Moscow Treaty different. It came wake America's 2001 withdrawal Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty 1972, first time United States Russia reduced offensive nuclear weapons agreement place constrained missile defenses. Breaking link offensive force reductions limits defense marked key moment establishment new nuclear agenda longer focused Cold War face-off Warsaw Pact NATO. The real threat world's dangerous weapons could end hands world's dangerous regimes—or terrorists would launch attacks devastating 9/11. And since rogue states also pursued ballistic missiles, defenses would (alongside offensive weapons) integral security United States allies. It context consider potential contribution New Start treaty U.S. national security. The treaty modest, reducing offensive nuclear weapons 1,550 side—more enough deterrence. While treaty puts limits launchers, U.S. military commanders testified able maintain triad bombers, submarine-based delivery vehicles land-based delivery vehicles. Moreover, treaty helpfully reinstates on-site verification Russian nuclear forces, lapsed expiration original Start treaty last year. Meaningful verification significant achievement Presidents Reagan George H.W. Bush, reinstatement crucial. Still, legitimate concerns New Start must addressed ratification process and, treaty ratified, future monitoring Obama administration's commitments. First, smaller forces make modernization nuclear infrastructure even urgent. Sen. Jon Kyl Arizona led valiant effort regard. Thanks efforts, roughly $84 billion allocated Department Energy's nuclear weapons complex. Ratifying treaty help cement commitments, Congress fully fund president's program. Congress also support Defense Department modernizing launchers suggested recent defense strategy study coauthored former Secretary Defense Bill Perry former National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley. Second, Senate must make absolutely clear ratifying treaty, U.S. re-establishing Cold War link offensive forces missile defenses. New Start's preamble worrying regard, recognizes "interrelationship" two. Administration officials testified link, treaty limit U.S. missile defenses. But Congress ensure future Defense Department budgets reflect this. Moscow contends current U.S. missile-defense plans acceptable treaty. But U.S. must remain fully free explore deploy best defenses—not imagined today. That includes pursuing potential qualitative breakthroughs quantitative increases. I personally witnessed Moscow's tendency interpret every utterance binding commitment. The Russians need understand U.S. use full-range American technology talent improve ability intercept destroy ballistic missiles hostile countries. Russia reassured fact nuclear arsenal far sophisticated large degraded missile defenses. In addition, welcome agreements missile-defense cooperation reached Lisbon recently NATO Russia improve transparency allow Moscow Washington work together field. After all, North Korean Iranian missile threat United States, international stability broadly. Ratification treaty also sold way buy Moscow's cooperation issues. The men Kremlin know loose nukes hands terrorists—some operate Russia's unstable south—are dangerous. That alone give governments reason work together beyond New Start address threat tactical nuclear weapons, smaller dispersed, therefore harder monitor control. Russia knows nuclear Iran volatile Middle East development North Korea's arsenal interest. Russia lives neighborhoods. That helps explain Moscow's toughening stance toward Tehran longstanding concern Pyongyang. The issue Senate place New Start America's future security. Nuclear weapons us long time. After treaty, focus must stopping dangerous proliferators—not reductions U.S. Russian strategic arsenals, really threat international stability. A modern smaller nuclear arsenal increasingly sophisticated defenses right bases U.S. nuclear security (and allies) going forward. With right commitments understandings, ratification New Start treaty contribute goal. If Senate enters commitments understandings record ratification, New Start deserves bipartisan support, whether lame-duck session next year.
