Mr. Vargas Llosa offered glass red wine. Then proceeded discuss believes literature change world. Mr. Vargas Llosa's Nobel Prize great victoryâ€”and talented prolific author. His work perhaps greatest rebuttal believe literature exists periphery history politics, claim "no time" fiction. In New Republic essay 2001, Mr. Vargas Llosa argued granting literature "an important place life nations." He wrote, 'Without it, critical mind, real engine historical change best protector liberty, would suffer irreparable loss." Mr. Vargas Llosa's novels reflect deep, personal hatred dictatorships staunch belief value individual liberty. He hardly novelist shed light themes, I would argue among successful. Columnist Mary Anastasia O'Grady anti-Communist Peruvian writer. A case point "Conversation Cathedral," work Mr. Vargas Llosa said would rescue first fire. The novel set Peru, dark days Manuel Odria dictatorship 1950s, Mr. Vargas Llosa grew up. He told book wanted describe dictatorships impregnate "every act life."

The one constant perceptive empathetic glimpse wide range human experience. As Mr. Vargas Llosa wrote 2001 essay literature, "Nothing better protects human stupidity prejudice, racism, religious political sectarianism, exclusivist nationalism truth invariably appears great literature: men women nations places essentially equal."
