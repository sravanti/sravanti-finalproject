'This one days want throw hands say, 'What world doing?'" Senator Claire McCaskill, Missouri Democrat, said. "It's unconscionable," Carl Levin, senior Democratic senator Michigan, said. "The obstructionism become mindless." The Senators Capitol, sunk armchairs marble fireplace press lounge, directly behind Senate chamber. It four-thirty Wednesday afternoon. McCaskill, matching maroon jacket top, looked exasperated; Levin glowered spectacles. "Also, it's dumb rule itself," McCaskill said. "It's time started looking rules." She referring Senate Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5, requires unanimous consent committees subcommittees hold hearings two afternoon Senate session. Both Levin McCaskill scheduled hearings day two-thirty. Typically, wouldn't difficult get colleagues waive rule; general admiral flown halfway around world appear Levin's Armed Services Committee, McCaskill's Subcommittee Contracting Oversight Homeland Security Committee investigating training Afghan police. But March 24th, day President Barack Obama signed health-care-reform bill, victory ceremony White House; also day Senate vote reconciliation bill health-care reform, approved House three nights earlier, would retroactively remove new law's embarrassing sweetheart deals complete yearlong process passing universal health care. Republicans, fought bill bloc, mood make things easy. So, four hours earlier, Levin went Senate floor asked consent hold hearing, Senator Richard Burr, Republican North Carolina, member Levin's committee, refused. "I personal objection continuing," Burr said. But, added, "there objection side aisle. Therefore, I would object." Burr object behalf party Republican chamber Levin spoke. In general, senators give speeches floor, colleagues aren't around, two three might present aren't listening. They're joking aides, e-mailing Twitter ideas press secretaries, getting first look speech they're give eight unmanned cameras provide live feed C-SPAN2. The presiding officer Senate—freshmen majority party take rotating, hour-long shifts intended introduce ways institution—sits chair dais, scanning BlackBerry reading Times article Senate. Michael Bennet, freshman Democrat Colorado, said, "Sit watch us seven days—just watch floor. You know you'll see happening? Nothing. When I'm chair, I sit thinking, I wonder they're China right now?" Between speeches, quorum calls, time killers Senate clerk calls roll rate one name every minutes. The press gallery, dais, typically deserted, journalists prefer hunker press lounge, surfing Web analysis current Senate negotiations; television screens alert something interest actually happens chamber. The people pay attention speech Senate stenographers. On afternoon, two portly bald men suits stood facing speaker feet away, tapping transcription machines, resembled nineteenth-century cash registers, slung around necks. The Senate chamber intimate room men women go talk record. Like many aspects senatorial procedure, Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5 relic days senators hover around desks know happening floor main afternoon debate. (The desks, built long ago 1819, mahogany, lids lift up, like old schoolhouse; desks Majority Minority Leader still equipped brass spittoons.) In press lounge, McCaskill said, light sarcasm, "Somebody told rule make sure people pay attention what's happening floor debate distracted committee work. Clearly, it's old rule." The Republicans turned old rule new means obstruction. There would hearings afternoon; general admiral would come back another day. Like investment bankers Wall Street, senators days direct much creative energy toward manipulation arcane rules loopholes, scoring short-term successes magnifying institution's broader dysfunction. Around five o'clock, chamber began fill, reconciliation bill came vote; twenty-three amendments pending, Republicans, perhaps many come. Ordinarily, debate voting amendment might take two legislative days, rules reconciliation bill senators dispatch amendments one another, hot-dog-eating contest, minute debate side. The goal finish bill end evening, senators wouldn't miss day spring recess—apparently, thing worse government takeover health-care system. The usual longueurs Senate, forty minutes tick away antique clock rear double doors without word's spoken, yield frenzy. Harry Reid, Majority Leader, Nevada, predicted process, known Vote-O-Rama, would go past two morning, warned senators stay close chamber. Max Baucus, Montana, manager bill Democrats, rose said, "This first time recent memory reconciliation bill amendments one side only. These clearly amendments designed kill reconciliation and, therefore, kill health-care reform. So I much hope amendments defeated." Tall, gaunt Judd Gregg, New Hampshire, bill's Republican manager, took floor. "The position side aisle is: amendments allowed, even good," said. Indignation rouged cheeks, voice rose half octave. "Obviously, presume Republican Party inconvenience. The democratic process inconvenience. It also appears, considering opposition America, American people inconvenience." The Senate chamber laid four concentric semicircles, adjacent desks almost touching crowded Democratic side, desks much smaller Republican minority spaced loosely apart. The design meant emphasize senators' unity. But Baucus Gregg avoided eye contact across six feet aisle divides chamber two constantly warring factions. Senators required, custom, speak one another third person, directing anger sarcasm whichever poor freshman happens presiding officer moment. Rule XIX, Paragraphs 2 3—one original rules drawn Thomas Jefferson's "Manual Parliamentary Practice"—bars senators imputing unworthy conduct motives another senator, insulting senator's state. But rule finger-wagging, Baucus wagged Gregg shouting Al Franken, Minnesota, started shift presiding officer's chair: "Mr. President, make mistake, intent every single one amendments offered side aisle kill health-care reform. . . . A senator side aisle stood said hopefully President's Waterloo. They want kill health-care reform!" The voice Stuart Smalley filled chamber: "The time senator expired." For next nine hours, chamber became stage theatrical whose ending, like almost everything happens Senate floor, known advance all. The Republican goal Vote-O-Rama embarrass Democrats appearing suggest useful changes; Democratic goal prevent change bill, wouldn't return House, might voted down. Several Republican amendments designed make Democrats look hypocritical, forcing vote policies Party typically supports. One amendment, example, declared health-care bill could linked tax hike individuals making less two hundred thousand dollars year. Other amendments nakedly partisan, outlandish. David Vitter, Louisiana Republican, proposed amendment repealed entire law. Senator Tom Coburn, Republican obstetrician Oklahoma, introduced amendment insure veterans diagnosed mental illness would denied right firearms, another prevent "convicted child molesters, rapists, sex offenders" buying erectile-dysfunction drugs taxpayer funds. Coburn got minute allotted explain Viagra amendment without cracking smile. "This game amendment," insisted. "It actually saves money." So many senators snickered presiding officer banged gavel order. "The amendment offered senator Oklahoma makes mockery Senate," Baucus declared. "It crass political stunt aimed making thirty-second commercials, public policy." Baucus asked yeas nays, clerk called roll ragged pace. "Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins." Thirty-five-second pause. "Mr. Conrad, Mr. Corker." Ten seconds. "Mr. Cornyn." Senators pay attention sound name; cast votes they're inclined—wandering late, shuffling chamber's gentle blue-carpeted steps swarm colleagues milling well, clerks sit table, holding finger down. At one point, John McCain— one hundred senators struggling stay office—spent half minute waving stiff-armed, trying catch eye clerk could cast vote. In end, two Democrats—Evan Bayh, Indiana, Ben Nelson, Nebraska—joined Republicans opposing Viagra sex offenders. The amendment defeated. The carpeting chamber absorbs voices, long night one rose muffled drone Charles Schumer, said Gregg, "Get work! Stop screwing around health care!" Sporadically, sharp cackle emanated Al Franken, wandered chamber, looking Republicans could charm laughing. Observed press gallery, senators confined space began resemble zoo animals—Levin shambling brown bear, John Thune loping gazelle, Jim Bunning maddened grizzly. Each one displayed limited set behaviors: conversations, John Kerry planted inches away, loomed, clamped hands colleague's shoulders. Joe Lieberman patted everyone back. It became clear senators loners (Russ Feingold, Daniel Akaka) social (Blanche Lincoln, Lindsey Graham); senators important (Dick Durbin, Jon Kyl) ignored (Bayh, Bunning). Past midnight, Durbin slumped desk, one hand face, yawning painfully. Susan Collins going mail. Twenty-three amendments voted down, Republicans proposing fresh batch. "Can get order?" Bunning growled, introduced proposal let senior citizens opt parts Medicare. It amendment Republicans joined Democrats defeat. Harry Reid controls Senate's schedule, Mitch McConnell, Kentucky, Minority Leader, object. Since nearly everything Senate depends unanimous consent, main business place continuous negotiation two supremely unsentimental men. That night, played game chicken: McConnell, unsmiling, eyes riveted ahead, held prospect dozens amendments; Reid, former boxer, hunched mumbling, playing rope-a-dope, vowing fend amendments night. The two leaders left chamber confer privately proceed. Inside, atmosphere slumber party set in. Debbie Stabenow, Michigan, hand across heart, sang sentimental duet Robert Menendez, New Jersey. Exhaustion momentarily eased partisan divide. Claire McCaskill sat beside Tom Coburn, held erect finger face, casting Viagra vote, let go limp. Coburn could heard joke, "The longest lasted thirty seconds." At two-forty-five morning, Reid suddenly declared Senate adjourned. The Senate parliamentarian found two small violations reconciliation rules, meaning morning, despite Democrats' efforts, bill would go back House another vote. At bang gavel, senators fled. In parking lot, Capitol's northeast side, McCaskill climbed S.U.V. Levin, cramped sedan, chauffeured empty streets. On marble ledge near exit, Arlen Specter sat alone, ghost brown suit, staring straight ahead, waiting someone take away. The Senate reconvened 9:45 A.M. Around two afternoon, members gathered final vote, Democrats giddy. Tom Harkin, Iowa, Christopher Dodd, Connecticut, even exchanged hug. "Everyone's tired," Reid declared final vote. "This legislative fight one record books." He fatigued initially voted wrong way. Lindsey Graham came late, delaying tally ten minutes. "Way go, Lindsey, way stretch out," Sam Brownback told him. A Republicans lingered took moment, like players losing team end World Series. After year work, health-care reform passed, 56-43, moment chamber's Tweeting pygmies become legislative giants. The Senate often referred "the world's greatest deliberative body." Jeff Merkley, freshman Democrat Oregon, said, "That phrase I wince time I hear it, amount real deliberation, terms exchange ideas, limited." Merkley could remember witnessing one moment floor debate Republican Democrat. "The memory I took was: 'Wow, that's unusual—there's conversation occurring they're making point counterpoint challenging other.' And yet nobody else chamber." Tom Udall, freshman Democrat New Mexico, could recall seeing senator change another senator's mind. "You would really need good hour two extensive exchange among folks really know issue," said. Instead, senator typically gives "a prepared speech that's already vetted staff. Then another guy gets gives speech completely different subject." From time time, senators party carry colloquy—"I would interested distinguished senator Iowa's view side's Medicare Advantage plan"—that scripted advance aides. While senators Washington, days scheduled fifteen-minute intervals: staff meetings, interviews, visits lobbyists home-state groups, caucus lunches, committee hearings, briefing books, floor votes, fund-raisers. Each senator sits three four committees even subcommittees, meet morning hours, helps explain committee tables often nearly empty, senators drifting hearing barely sustain coherent line questioning. All activity crammed three-day week, it's unwritten rule modern Senate votes almost never scheduled Mondays Fridays, allows senators spend four days away capital. Senators now, unlike several decades ago, often keep families home states, return weekends, even it's Alaska Idaho—a concession endless fund-raising, populist anti-Washington mood recent years. (When Newt Gingrich became Speaker House, 1995, told new Republican members move families capital.) Tom Daschle, former Democratic leader, said, "When scheduled votes, day could absolutely certain one hundred senators Wednesday afternoon." Nothing dominates life senator raising money. Tom Harkin, Iowa Democrat, said, "Of free time have, I would say fifty per cent, maybe even more," spent fund-raising. In addition financing campaigns, senators participate least week Power Hour, make obligatory calls behalf Party (in Democrats' case, three-story town house across Constitution Avenue Senate office buildings, since they're barred using offices raise money). Lamar Alexander, Tennessee Republican, insisted donations never sufficient actually buy vote, added, "It sucks time senator ought spending getting know senators, working issues." In June, 2009, top aides Max Baucus, whose Finance Committee negotiating health-care-reform bill, took time meet two health-care lobbyists, former Baucus aides. (Baucus received million dollars industry 2008 reelection campaign.) That month, according Common Cause, industry groups spending $1.4 million day lobby members Congress. Udall, speaking corrosive effect fund-raising lobbying, said, "People know heart—they know place dominated special interests. The over-all bills nearly bold influence money." Deschle sketched portrait contemporary senator busy think: "Sometimes, you're dialling dollars, get call, you've got get vote, you've got fifteen minutes. You don't clue what's floor, staff whispering ears, you're running onto floor, check leader—you double check—but, make triple sure, there's little sheet paper clerk's table: The leader recommends aye vote, vote. So you've got checks make sure don't screw up, even screw sometimes. But, you're ever pressed, 'Why vote way?'—you walk thinking, Oh, God, I hope nobody asks, I don't clue." Aides, elbows senators shuttle offices Capitol, proliferated past decades, play crucial role. Lamar Alexander, office fifty people, pointed staff members, younger often ideological bosses, less dependent institutional relationships, tend push senators toward extremes. Often, aides main actors behind proposed legislation—writing bills, negotiating details—while senator relegated repeating talking points Fox' MSNBC. One day office, Udall picked tabloids coffee table waved me. "You know rags cover Hill, right?" said, smiling. There five dailies—Politico, The Hill, Roll Call, Con gressDaily, CQ Today—all emphasize insider conflict. The senators, like complain trivializing effect "24/7 media," provide end fodder it. The news day Udall called "dust-up" Scott Brown, freshman Massachusetts Republican, staffer Jim DeMint, arch-conservative South Carolina; staffer Tweeted Brown voting often Democrats, leading Brown confront DeMint Senate floor supposed breach protocol. Bloggers carry much influence many senators young press aide dedicated care feeding online media. News about, by, tiny kingdom political obsessives dominates attention senators staff, stories might affect constituents go unreported home-state papers longer afford bureaus Washington. Dodd, came Senate 1981 leave next January, told me, "I used eleven Connecticut newspaper reporters covered daily basis. I don't one today, haven't one number years. Instead, D.C. publications see prism conflict." Lamar Alexander described effect "this instant radicalizing positions left right." Both Alexander Gregg said Senate polarized rising number senators—now nearly fifty—who come House, rather governorships positions bipartisan coOperation still permissible. "A lot senators don't understand history tradition institution," Gregg said. "Substantive, thoughtful, moderate discussion pushed aside." Encumbered aides, prodded hourly jolts electronic media, racing hearing room caucus lunch Power Hour airport, senators longer time, perhaps inclination, get know one another—least all, members party. Friendships across party lines likely among spouses live Washington. After Udall joined Senate, last year, invited dinner Alexander, Jill Cooper Udall Honey Alexander become friends women's social club. It remains time Udall set foot house Republican senator. (Vice-President Joe Biden, autobiography, recalls that, seventies, bipartisan group senators wives hosted monthly dinner: "In days Democrats Republicans actually enjoyed other's company.") When I asked Chris Dodd well knew, example, Jim DeMint, Dodd said, "Not all. Whereas Jesse Helms I knew pretty well." He repeated something Jon Kyl, Republican whip, Arizona, recently said him: "There's trust." Dodd, whose father senator, went on, "That's really is—this place really operates that. I don't think anyone would argue conclusion. And that's missing. There remains veneer—badly chipped—of comity. On floor, senators still refer members opposing party "friends." Gregg described Kent Conrad, Democrat North Dakota, "one best friends Senate," Gregg Alexander ticked examples little-known legislation currently working Democrats; Alexander Ben Cardin, Maryland, introduced bill ban mountaintop-removal coal mining. Udall noted become friendly John McCain went congressional tour Iraq. But opportunities bond rare. On first floor Capitol, private dining room senators, "inner sanctum," Republicans Democrats used lunch (at separate tables, room). In seventies, old bulls James Eastland, Hubert Humphrey, Jacob Javits held court there; later, Daniel Patrick Moynihan did. "You learned, also found going on," Dodd said, adding, "It's awfully difficult say crappy things someone lunch with." These days, inner sanctum nearly always empty. Senators eat lunch respective caucus rooms members party, else "downtown," means asking donors money steak potatoes Monocle Charlie Palmer. The tradition "caucus lunch" instituted Republicans fifties, lost majority; Democrats, losing 1980, followed suit. Caucus lunches work members sides state pep-rally fervor. During one recent Republican lunch, Jim Bunning referred Harry Reid idiot. "At least courtesy behind closed doors," Alexander joked, adding, "We spend time team meetings deciding we're going other." In 2007, Alexander Lieberman started series bipartisan Tuesday breakfasts. "They kind dwindled health-care debate," Alexander said. Udall tried revive Wednesday inner-sanctum lunch. For first months, Democrats attended. Then, one Wednesday May, Susan Collins, Maine Republican, showed up, joking nervously turncoat; protect reputation, presence kept secret. These efforts resurrecting dead customs self-conscious and, probably, doomed get-togethers lovers try stay friends breakup. Ira Shapiro, Washington lawyer former aide Senator Gaylord Nelson, Wisconsin, put way: "Why would want lunch together hate other?" The upper chamber Congress constitutional compromise popular sovereignty state sovereignty. The Senate designed, part separation powers, check impulses House popular will. For Federalists, also aristocratic purpose: collect knowledge experience, guard levelling spirit might overtake majority. When Alexis de Tocqueville visited Senate, 1832, deeply impressed quality members: "They represent lofty thoughts [of nation] generous instincts animating it, petty passions." But also recognized "a minority nation dominating Senate could completely paralyze majority represented house, contrary spirit constitutional government." As long Senate continued composed America's talented statesmen, Tocqueville implied, would restrain anti-democratic potential. Robert A. Caro, "Master Senate," third volume life Lyndon Johnson, argues Civil War • Senate captured wealthy sectional interests, ending high-minded age Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun engaged brilliant debate. Aside spasms legislation start Presidencies Woodrow Wilson Franklin Roosevelt, Caro writes, Senate remained controlled alliance Southern racists Republican corporate shills, "the dam waves social reform dashed vain— chief obstructive force federal government." By fifties, Senate become far conservative public. And conservative: William S. White, 1956 book "Citadel," called Senate "to peculiar degree, Southern Institution . . . growing heart ostensibly national assembly" "the place country South lose war." By mid-century, become journalistic cliché call Senate broken. Otto Preminger's 1962 film "Advise Consent," based novel Allen Drury, Senate period, presents Democrats Republicans equally amoral, calculating, power-hungry. But institution, depicted Preminger, still works, way: though deals stink, get cut. The senators know colleagues rules; back-stab one another lunchroom, drink cocktails play cards Saturday nights. There lobbyists, fund-raisers, media, constituents—only senators' intricate relations one another. The Senate world. In memoir, Johnson's longtime aide Harry McPherson recalls learning Senate's "famous 'club' atmosphere based members' mutual acceptance responsibility concentration tasks hand. . . . They thrust hard one another debate serious matters," but, writes, "understanding accommodation ordinary course Senate day essential sanity." Johnson, powerful Majority Leader history, bent Senate forced become efficient. He saw colleagues either "whales"—the heavyweight chairmen negotiated legislation—or "minnows," followers went along brokered deals. And when, 1958, formidable new class liberal Democrats entered Senate—including Edmund Muskie, Eugene McCarthy, Philip Hart—the legislative machinery began produce reform. Michael Janeway, author "The Fall House Roosevelt," worked summer staff member 1958 1962. "They used talk other—that's vivid recollection," said. "If Wayne Morse talked constitutional law floor, Southerners would come hear him. The Hubert Humphrey farm policy. My strongest impression deliberative body, drawing out—sometimes pedantically." Senators ran office order work foreign policy, social welfare, urbanization win credibility whales. "But wanted something mechanism could it," Janeway said. In sixties seventies, Southern-conservative control broken coalition left-of-center Democrats moderate Republicans. Donald Ritchie, Senate historian, started working 1976, described Senate decades "a bipartisan liberal institution." The Civil Rights Act 1964 written largely office Republican Minority Leader, Everett Dirksen. Every major initiative—voting rights, open housing, environmental law, campaign reform—enjoyed bipartisan support. In rare event filibuster, motion end debate often filed jointly leaders parties. When Medicare—that government takeover health care elderly—was passed, 1965, won 70-24. The Senate's momentum nurtured superb talent: William Fulbright, Everett Dirksen, Henry Jackson, Frank Church, Howard Baker. In 1969, George McGovern chaired select committee hunger actually held bipartisan "field hearings" poor regions, calling witnesses migrant labor camps, then, Bob Dole's indispensable support, greatly expanded food-stamp program. The intensity senatorial purpose years must strike today's legislators profoundly humbling. After Joe Biden came Senate, 1973, Hubert Humphrey took aside said, "You pick issue becomes yours. That's attract colleagues follow you, Joe. That's demonstrate bona fides. Don't gadfly." Humphrey's career advice: "You become Mr. Housing. Housing future." The Senate's modern decline began 1978, election new wave anti-government conservatives, accelerated Republicans became majority 1981. "The Quayle generation came in, number people like Dan—same generation, hair style, beliefs," Gary Hart, Colorado Democrat, recalled. "They harder-line. They weren't get along Democrats. But look accommodationist compared Republicans Senate today." Church, McGovern, Javits, Birch Bayh gone. Ira Shapiro, former aide, writing book Senate sixties seventies, said, "It huge loss experienced, accomplished senators replaced neophytes. All sudden, 1981, half Senate less six years." He added, "The shattering great Senate long-term effects keep showing up. It gets worse time, never gets restored. There phrase I heard Helms younger ones: 'Others didn't want make waves; I wanted drain swamp.'" After C-SPAN went air, 1979, cozy atmosphere encouraged deliberation back-room deals began yield transparency and, it, posturing. "So Damn Much Money," recent book Washington Post reporter Robert G. Kaiser, traces spectacular rise Washington lobbying period. Liberal Republicans began disappear, Southern Democrats died replaced conservative Republicans. Bipartisan coalitions wings Senate vanished. The institutionalist gave way free agent, controlled fund-raising apparatus media presence, whose electoral base patchwork single-issue groups. Members parties—Howard Metzenbaum, Ohio Democrat; Jesse Helms, North Carolina Republican—took regularly using Senate's rules tie business narrowly ideological reasons. The number filibusters shot eighties continued rise following decades, parties kept alternating control Senate escalating procedural arms race, routinely blocking confirmation executive judicial appointees. Democrats filibustered Republican nominees bench; Republicans threatened ban filibuster cases—the so- called "nuclear option." Older members perturbed when, 2004, Republican Majority Leader, Bill Frist, went South Dakota campaign Democratic Minority Leader, Tom Daschle (who went lose). A years earlier, action would unthinkable. The weakened institution could longer withstand pressures outside walls; money cameras rushed in, independent minds fell line partisans. Rough parity two parties meant every election potential make break majority, crushing incentive cooperate across aisle. The Senate, longer fount ideas, became backwater U.S. government. During Clinton years, main action White House Gingrich House Representatives; Bush years, Republican Senate majority abdicated oversight role could placed vital check executive power. Norman Ornstein, congressional expert American Enterprise Institute, said Senate increasingly become populated "ideologues charlatans." He went on, "When get good people come in, quickly get ground dynamic culture parties. And get there, look takes stay there." He spoke Charles Grassley, Iowa Republican, who, nearing end career, spent much last year working closely friend Max Baucus health-care bill. Then, August, Grassley went home and, faced angry Republican voters prospect primary challenge right, started warning "pulling plug Grandma." Ornstein added similar pressures led John McCain begin "altering behavior abandoning every issue, including campaign-finance reform." One morning April, I visited Harry McPherson, former L.B.J. aide, offices legal lobbying firm D. L. A. Piper, downtown Washington. McPherson, eighty, desk firm's spiral-bound directory 111th Congress. I asked who, Johnsonian terms, whales current Senate. McPherson ran finger list senators. He again. "I'm trying here, looking remote descendant. Judas Priest, look this." He stumped. "Well, I see good people, I see people going get coalitions together time." He put directory aside. "I'm damnedest time." Down hall McPherson's office Mel Martinez, former Republican senator Florida; hired last year, two weeks resigning Senate seat without completing first term. (He since moved JPMorgan Chase.) William Cohen, former Maine senator Secretary Defense, office downstairs. Tom Daschle works D. L. A. Piper; predecessor Democratic leader, George Mitchell, firm's chairman, President Obama appointed Middle East envoy. One feature diminished U.S. senator ease moves legislating lobbying. Between 1998 2004, half senators left office became lobbyists. In 2007, Trent Lott, Republican leader Senate less year fourth term, abruptly resigned formed lobbying firm former Senator John Breaux, weeks new law took effect requiring two-year waiting period serving lobbying. When spend days Senate, it's easy forget everything else. The House Representatives seems miles away (it's corridor across rotunda), White House another country, actual foreign countries unimaginable. The place remains insular, labyrinthine, opaque—even physically. Senators commute thirty seconds offices chamber electric subway cars run along tunnel Constitution Avenue. Many signs misleading obsolete (the gilded lettering visitors' gallery says "Men's Gallery"), Capitol filled secret passageways spare rooms, called hideaways, doled according seniority, senators read, drink, doze, wait buzzer announcing imminent vote. The pervasive authority institution Constitution Bible but, rather, impenetrable sixteen-hundred-page tome, Floyd M. Riddick, called "Senate Procedure: Precedents Practices," late Robert Byrd, West Virginia, known read entirety. The procedures abstruse parliamentarian must sit presiding officer and, essentially, tell say. After half century, picture given Preminger's "Advise Consent" still faintly visible. "The Senate, nature, place consensus reigns personal relationships paramount," Lamar Alexander said. "And that's changed." Which exactly problem: it's self-governing body depends reasonableness members function. Sarah Binder, congressional scholar George Washington University, said, "To chamber rules unanimous consent—it's nutty! Especially you've got Jim Bunning please." In 2006 2008, sixteen Democrats entered Senate, giving Party current majority fifty-nine forty-one (counting two independents). They include moderates, like Jon Tester, Montana, Mark Warner, Virginia; liberals, like Sherrod Brown, Ohio, Sheldon Whitehouse, Rhode Island; policy specialists, like Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota, Jeff Merkley; iconoclasts, like Claire McCaskill. Their interest legislating won admiration senior senators. "If stay, I think they'll terrific," Chris Dodd said. "My worry won't stay. Because it's productive." The Democratic class 2008 arrived President Obama, expecting usher 6 dynamic new era. Instead, young Senate careers passed daily slog threatened filibusters "secret holds"—when senator anonymously objects bringing appointment vote, requires unanimous consent. On April 20th, Claire McCaskill took trouble read names fifty-six Obama nominees languishing limbo secret holds, Jon Kyl objected every one them. Just getting bill floor debate require days tactical gamesmanship party leaders. There times Warner wondered anyone ever quit first year. Michael Bennet said, "We find moment history questions huge ones, small ones, things put really long period time." He mentioned national debt, energy policy, financial crisis. "Yet Senate that's designed advance change slow it." We talking hideaway, windowless room Capitol basement, mini-fridge stocked bottled water, black leatherette furniture circa 1962, TV tuned C-SPAN2 mute; Senator Kyl's mouth moving. Bennet, former superintendent schools Denver, appointed vacant seat 2009, already defend year. He described Senate dry bluntness outsider hasn't allowed grow attached. Bennet repeated story heard. new congressman giving maiden speech: "And veteran guy came said, 'Son, you're talking like place level. It's level.' As fifteen months gone I've here, less level seems." Earlier year, Senate's procedural absurdities became national news twice one month. On February 4th, Con gressDaily reported Richard Shelby, Alabama Republican, secretly blocking confirmation seventy Obama appointees dispute involving defense earmarks his•state. (His tactics exposed, Shelby—whose office maintains responsible fewer fifty holds—lifted three.) Later month, Bunning spent several days late night Senate floor, filibustering prevent benefits paid millions unemployed Americans. When Merkley tried reason him, Bunning responded, "Tough shit." (Eventually, Republicans persuaded Bunning stop.) These incidents elicited brief outcry, extent Senate's routine folly remains largely hidden. For example, Grassley Ron Wyden, Oregon, trying since 1997 end practice secret holds, without success. In 2007, Senate passed bill banning secret holds last longer six days. But get around ban two senators pass hold back forth—it's called "rolling holds"—and party leader facilitates game keeping names secret. Many Senate's antique rules precedents warped beyond recognition modern pressures partisanship. The hold, example, courtesy extended senators days horse travel, needed time get back Washington read bill question appointee casting vote. Sarah Binder, co- authored book filibuster, calls procedure historical accident: 1806, Senate got rid little-used rule allowed "previous question" called vote. Suddenly, inherent limit debate, eighteen-thirties senators begun taking advantage loophole, derailing proceedings getting talking voice, legs, bladder gave out. (The word "filibuster' comes vrijbuiter—old Dutch "looter.") In 1917, Woodrow Wilson, wartime legislative agenda blocked filibusters, forced Senate pass Rule XXII, allowed two-thirds majority bring floor debate end "cloture" vote. For decades, rule rarely used; 1919 1971, forty-nine cloture votes, fewer one per year. In seventies eighties, annual average rose dozen. (Frustration increase led Senate, 1975, lower threshold cloture sixty votes.) In nineties early aughts, average went twenty-five thirty year, parties escalated use filibuster found minority. After Republicans lost majority 2006, filibusters became everyday events: hundred twelve cloture votes 2007 2008, session Republicans target break filibuster record. The tally cloture votes reflects small fraction senatorial obstruction. Three hundred forty-five bills passed House prevented even coming debate Senate. "Why?" Steny Hoyer, outraged Democratic Majority Leader House, asked me. "Because business way facilitates noncontroversial things. Thankfully, House Representatives becoming Senate." Last week, six House Democrats expressed displeasure upper chamber staging sit-in sorts Senate floor. Seventy-six nominees judgeships executive posts approved committees but, blocks, haven't come vote full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle jobs unfilled across upper levels Obama Administration. (The Democrats also practiced art blocking nominees Bush Administration.) There's often objection individual blocked: eight-month hold, Martha Johnson, nominated run General Services Administration, confirmed 96-0. On issue like health-care reform, objection substantive, Republicans ransacked Riddick's "Senate Procedure" every conceivable way delay debate vote. Judd Gregg even sent memo stalling tactics Republican colleagues. Tom Coburn demanded reading aloud entire seven-hundred-and-sixty-seven-page amendment proposed Bernie Sanders, Vermont socialist; Senate clerks, working half-hour shifts, three hours chore Sanders withdrew amendment frustration. Under McConnell, Republicans consistently consumed much Senate's calendar possible legislative maneuvering. The strategy extend deliberation Senate's agenda prevent it. Tom Harkin, first proposed reform filibuster 1995, called Republican colleagues "nihilists," want create chaos serves ideology. "If there's chaos, things tend toward simple solutions," Harkin said. "In chaos people don't listen reason." McConnell respond requests interview, often argued Republican strategy reflects views majority Americans. In March, told Times, "To extent they"—the Democrats— "want things think political center would helpful country, we'll helpful. To extent trying turn us Western European country, going helpful." One mysteries Senate Mitch McConnell able keep members line, vote vote. Why moderates years experience power base back home—Richard Lugar, Indiana; Susan Collins, Maine; George Voinovich, Ohio—keep siding extreme members caucus? Alexander said McConnell listens well members, adding, "When back wall gallows hanging front you, tends unify. Operating forty members—it concentrates mind." Lindsey Graham described Times McConnell exhorted caucus disastrous 2008 election: "He said didn't stick together big things, wouldn't relevant." Last December, Republicans decided filibuster military-spending bill order delay looming vote health care close Christmas possible. Thad Cochran, Republican ranking member Appropriations Committee, promised Daniel Inouye, chairman, wouldn't join effort. But last minute Cochran, Senate since 1979 brings disproportionate amounts defense money Mississippi, told Reid leadership wouldn't allow vote Democrats end filibuster—even matter national security. (The Democrats able impose cloture, vote health care finally took place Christmas Eve.) Republican defections rare. In early 2009, Collins Olympia Snowe, also Maine, voted stimulus bill, along Arlen Specter (who promptly switched parties). Snowe also voted Finance Committee's health-care- reform bill last October, Republican so. But December, pivotal moment, voted version went full Senate. "I wasn't interested expanding program beyond Finance Committee version—it grew thousand pages," Snowe said. She wasn't included negotiations White House officials took place elegant conference room across Reid's suite offices, said Democrats "did accept proposals. As I said President, windup pitch." McConnell able exploit alienation. A friend Snowe cited another reason reversal: "She actually said never felt pressure felt health care, never pressure quite evident quite real troubling. Kyl McConnell saying things like 'You can't let us down, we're together. You're senior Republican member caucus, hang tough us. We expect you're going it.' " Reid doesn't use tough tactics; achieved position, spite public shortcomings, senator helped Democrats, always answered calls, got wanted masterly maneuvering. This made enormously popular within Democratic caucus, doesn't give leverage McConnell, let alone Lyndon Johnson. In current Senate, become normal handful senators, sometimes representing ten twenty per cent country's population, hold everything up. And status quo become sufficiently frustrating new senators considered radical option: mutiny. Tom Udall, sixty-two, older freshman senators. He crow's-feet Westerner spent time sun, slow, good-natured voice. His father, Stewart, Arizona congressman Interior Secretary Presidents Kennedy Johnson; uncle Mo legendary Arizona representative; cousin Mark freshman senator Colorado. Udall served five terms House winning Senate seat New Mexico, 2008. And yet air political Candide—he always earnest, capable disappointment cynicism. "I ran idea Senate graveyard good ideas," said. "Then inside—the thing strikes one senator hold whole show." In first year office, Udall decided something audacious: would try change Senate's rules. Customarily, rules continue session session, provision Rule XXII requires sixty-seven votes amend them, making extremely difficult. ("Rule XXII Catch-22," Ted Kennedy used joke.) Udall embraced different idea—the "constitutional option." Article I, Section 5 Constitution states "each House may determine Rules Proceedings" beginning new Congress. So, theory, senator could take floor next January propose debating rules scratch, including filibuster. New rules could passed simple majority. There's even precedent this: moves revisit rules invoking constitutional option made three times, recently 1975. Udall spent much past year trying build support idea. At request Udall others, Schumer, chairman Rules Committee, held series hearings filibuster, calling witnesses Sarah Binder, historian, Walter Mondale, Senate constitutional option invoked 1975. Dick Durbin, second-highest-ranking Democrat, organized working groups among newer members internal reforms, ending secret holds choosing committee chairs caucus vote rather seniority. (Lamar Alexander wryly suggested Schumer Durbin competing favor newer members, case Harry Reid loses seat fall run Majority Leader.) For Republican institutionalists, Alexander Gregg, push rules reform folly. "If want parliamentary form government, go House," Gregg, retire, scoffed. "Why even run Senate?" Udall's plan next January, said, would "gigantic mistake." "They'll get it," Alexander said Democrats' enthusiasm rules reform. "And they'll get quicker they're minority next January. Because they'll instantly see value slowing Senate consider whatever say." He added Senate "may getting done much American people want done." The President's ambitious agenda, all, upset lot voters, across political spectrum. None Republicans I spoke agreed contention Senate "broken." Alexander claimed Republicans exercising moderating, thoughtful influence legislation founders wanted Senate. "The Senate wasn't created efficient," argued. "It created inefficient." At one filibuster hearings, April, Alexander, sitting across table Udall, said that, times Democrats charge Republicans obstructing legislation, "we could say that's number times majority tried cut right debate, right offer amendments, essence Senate." Newcomers like Udall seem think Senate grown absurd extreme kind reform inevitable. Perhaps need time plumb depths institution's intransigence. According Sarah Binder, change rules extremely unlikely; Republicans would implacably opposed to, say, weakening filibuster, would Democrats, especially long-serving ones. "I would oppose that," Chris Dodd said, adding freshmen, "These people never minority." For older Democrats, put years, grown adept working rules, chair powerful committees, reform impulse could threat. (Among senior senators, sole enthusiast rules reform Tom Harkin.) One senator spoke Senate divided whales minnows but, rather, bulls calves. The older Democrats accustomed Senate's ways share frustrations newcomers; handful older moderate Republicans weak challenge newer radicals dominate caucus. Even freshmen Democrats somehow reform filibuster next January, Senate remain sclerotic, wasteful, unhappy body. The deepest source problems rules precedents but, rather, human beings, created culture Tocqueville's "lofty thoughts" "generous impulses" place. A days passing health-care reform, Senate struggled feet take second large task. Financial regulatory reform easiest piece major legislation Obama Presidency, likeliest win real bipartisan support. The financial crisis catastrophic millions Americans, 2008 bailout Wall Street become even hated Senate was. In April, lineup bankers Goldman Sachs appeared Senator Levin's subcommittee investigations, managed appear arrogant, callous, evasive reputations suggested. The public demanded action. Some Republicans genuine desire pass bill. If health-care reform war attrition, financial reform promising liaison. The affair began Republican, Bob Corker, Democrat, Mark Warner—both multimillionaires serving first term, considered centrists. Corker small, dapper former construction magnate became mayor Chattanooga; Warner tall, preppily dressed former telecommunications entrepreneur became governor Virginia. Chris Dodd, Banking Committee chairman, assigned work together section bill liquidation troubled firms—making sure would never another taxpayer bailout. They worked winter, Warner's office, Corker's office, dinner, sometimes without staff, members Senate past. They hosted series afternoon seminars, inviting guests Ben Bernanke, Alan Greenspan, Sheila Bair. Corker Warner sometimes said Democrat Republican still talking other. In January, Business Week called Senate's "Odd Couple." By February, finished work. Meanwhile, discussions entire bill Dodd Richard Shelby, top Republican committee, dragged on, repeatedly breaking down. Finally, February 10th, Dodd called Corker, who, though one committee's junior members, agreed chairman's Republican negotiating partner. When Corker informed McConnell Shelby, expressed surprise. "It odd place be," Corker recalled. "And yet night began meeting." The junior Republican savored rare experience creating, rather opposing, legislation. In response, Shelby's conservative staff tried undermine Corker, spreading rumors among Republicans lobbyists giving much away. (A Shelby aide said staff members simply informing Republicans Party's line financial reform.) On March 10th, Dodd concluded move bill floor. He called Corker said, "You've great partner." He ending talks month. "It's little stunning, I've got honest," Corker told reporters afterward. Someone close negotiations compared Corker Dickens's Miss Havisham, unable get rebuff, forever awaiting arrival groom, clocks stopped. Corker later said Dodd ended talks pressure White House Democrats. Dodd said Corker unable bring Republicans him. "Baloney," Corker said. "If Dodd reached agreement me, we'd've least twenty- five Republican votes." The bill Dodd brought Senate, year discussions Democrats Republicans alike, incorporated bipartisan plan Warner Corker prevent another bank bailout: setting fifty-billion-dollar fund, paid banks, insure orderly liquidation, establishing risk council detect warning signs another crisis. But mid-April Mitch McConnell—who met Wall Street executives New York, parroting talking points memo written Republican strategist Frank Luntz—called "partisan bill" "will guarantee perpetual taxpayer bailout Wall Street banks." McConnell presented letter, signed forty-one Republicans, suggesting would filibuster financial-reform bill. His remarks amounted repudiation Corker's work well Dodd's. The next day, April 15th, Corker pleaded colleagues, Tennessee twang, "Let's come floor let's act like adults. Let's tone rhetoric. Let's don't exaggerate pluses minuses. Let's Senate created do. . . . We supposed people took red-hot activities sometimes come body sat cooler heads resolved issues like adults. We that. As matter fact, I would say, cannot financial regulation, issue really doesn't real philosophical bearings . . ." Corker didn't allow thought ripen—he already gone farther almost Republican would dared. Dodd spoke later day completed Corker's speech: "I know friends side aisle faced difficult choice supporting party leadership participating complicated, difficult debate. I naïve. I know hard place be. But can't act like U.S. senators sake issue . . . even here?" He went on, "We work American public sick tired feeling like one looking interests, like political hacks lobbyists hold cards discussions. The minority seems intent proving right. . . . I long time. I know institution better that. I know friends mine side aisle care bill, want part debate, want part solution." In speech, Dodd joined partisan fight, accusing McConnell lying bill. Turning crimson-faced, chopped air hand shouted, "I ask myself, I go process last four five months, agreeing much offering, single political vote show it. . . . I say younger members, newer members coming along: careful!" Corker, heard Dodd speaking, returned chamber asked respond. "You I went long way," Corker told Dodd. "Then stopped. On March 10th ended. I understand that, look, losing Democrats committee." "And I gaining Republicans," Dodd replied. "You one, asked started. I never said I could speak anybody myself. And I leave table." Corker urged Dodd keep talking Republicans—their differences could sorted days. But McConnell's agenda. Instead, financial reform became slightly polite repeat health-care- reform brawl: Republicans threatened filibusters, Democrats threatened all-nighters, thousands lobbyists prowled Capitol, charging Wall Street clients billion dollars. On April 28th, I sitting ornate Reception Room Jim Manley, Reid's spokesman. On side wall, noise furniture scraping across tile floor. "Those cots set L.B.J. Room," Manley said. "Very little happens around without deadline." The cots persuaded Republicans allow bill move floor debate. A weeks later, May 20th, yet another filibuster defeated yet another cloture motion, financial reform finally came vote. It passed, 59-39. Only four Republicans joined majority. Corker wasn't among them. He even voted amendment, offered Republican colleague Jeff Sessions, Alabama, would scrapped Corker's work many months Warner. "The idea watching Bob Corker vote Sessions amendment!" Dodd said afterward, sitting red-curtained office, print Holbein's portrait Thomas More. "It's Senate, I guess." McConnell's strategy obstruction come close succeeding, Dodd said, knew "shrinking number" Republicans frustrated. The previous day, Dodd said Susan Collins, "God, I would loved ranking member this." Collins responded, "We could great time bill." Warner, said believed bipartisanship "the American people don't trust either political party enough give blank check," astonished Republicans voted financial reform. "There zero substantive reason couldn't eighty votes," said. I asked Bob Corker voted bill. Warner started talk consumer-protection title, said, "If want vote something, always find reasons." But Corker hadn't seemed want vote it. He spent months trying act like U.S. senator, alienating party party, day vote held floor better part thirty minutes, still reluctant let effort go. "I obviously disappointed," said. "I think I spent much time senator. . . policy regarding financial system. I think bill—even bill—has good things it. There question. And I appreciate thrust. But I think lot overreaching, I think enough time spent core issues." As senators cast votes, I noticed Robert Kaiser, author "So Damn Much Money," press gallery. I later asked if, passage two big reform bills three months, witnessing possible renewal Senate. "If engage public opinion way politicians understand, public opinion still blow away money interest groups," said. "But past decades reflex grown Senate that, things considered, it's better avoid take big issues. This kind thing drives Michael Bennet nutty: you've arrived United States Senate can't fuck-all destruction planet." After final vote financial reform, Republicans flew home, Democratic leaders held press conference, smiling microphones outside Senate chamber. Reid said, "For wanted protect Wall Street, didn't work." He excused himself: join Biden telephone fund-raiser "some Nevadans." Durbin said, "I stunned four Republicans would join us passing historic legislation. What take bring Republican Party conversation future America?" Dodd, glowing triumph, said, "I wanted demonstrate Senate United States could conduct business much founders intended. We that." On July 21st, President Obama signed completed bill. The two lasting achievements Senate, financial regulation health care, required year half legislative warfare nearly destroyed body. They depended set circumstances—a large majority Democrats, charismatic President electoral mandate, national crisis—that last long repeated anytime soon. Two days financial reform became law, Harry Reid announced Senate would take comprehensive energy-reform legislation rest year. And climate change joined immigration, job creation, food safety, pilot training, veterans' care, campaign finance, transportation security, labor law, mine safety, wildfire management, scores executive judicial appointments list matters world's greatest deliberative body incapable addressing. Already, feel Senate slipping back stagnant waters.
