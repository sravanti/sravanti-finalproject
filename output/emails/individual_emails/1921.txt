Dear Hillary, Hope resting comfortably. Please take excuse get much needed rest. Lots people expressed best wishes me--Sean Wilentz, Joe Conason, Gene Lyons, etc--so haven't contacted you're behind wall know many, many people thinking now. I spoke morning Gary Sick, who, recall, senior person NSC Iran hostage crisis, Columbia. He one best intelligence networks Iran, 1,500 people, experts extensive contacts, many Iranians, deeply embedded unfolding events Gary tells Mousavi evolved mild-mannered reformer directly challenging regime. Nobody, says, knows go, certainly Iranians. Khamenei exposed lost aura mystification, plunging arena political player. Mousavi issued new revolutionary manifesto, translated; I enclose Sick's report analysis it. This poses, Sick says, new challenge Khamenei. Does let stand? Does answer it? Sick also says US diplomacy fact can't accomplish anything regime crisis completely works way out, could take years. He points first mass demonstrations Shah occurred full year overthrow. He adds one thing regime learned fro m Shah equivocal toward demonstrations. Two ideas, knows, are: 1. Though regime uses Western protests consolidate control, contribute deep crisis legitimacy. Sick says Obama's statement, example, good. He also cites statement Ban Ki Moon. If would UN action, shouldn't focus ont human rights/violence aspect? A statement and/or resolution urging regime stop illegitimate violence paramilitary militias? US shouldn't initiate. 2. Establish linkage negotiations Russians Start objections missile defense outposts Poland Czech Republic (especially plan give up) Russian arms sales Iran. Get well. See Sick analysis below.
