Verma, Richard R <VermaRR@state.gov> Friday, November 5, 2010 6:05 AM H; Lew, Jacob J; Mills, Cheryl D FW: The Cable: Granger seeking chairmanship State foreign ops subcommittee The Cable: Granger seeking chairmanship State foreign ops subcommittee Granger seeking chairmanship State foreign ops subcommittee Posted: 03 NOV 2010 1131 AM PDT Texas Congresswoman Kay Granger seek chairmanship State Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, according spokesman, ending rumors would forgo post favor position. Although decisions made, last night Granger ranking Republican panel clear frontrunner job. She would succeed current chairwoman Nita Lowey(D-NY), served chairwoman since 2006. "Congresswoman Granger interested continuing chair state foreign operations appropriations subcommittee," Matt LeffingwelL press secretary, toldThe Cable Wednesday. When power switches Congress, complicated game musical chairs begins senior members jockey committee subcommittee chairs. Just highest-ranking minority member panel doesn't mean one automatically takes chairmanship. But Granger succeed Lowey, play large role writing bills appropriate money State Department operations, USAID, foreign operations, foreign assistance, humanitarian assistance, many things. Those accounts face unprecedented pressure next year GOP led Congress looking spending cuts don't strong domestic constituencies. Last month, identified Granger one 10 Republicans stand influential next Congress GOP won control House. Since then, we've received several e-mails sources heard Granger would forgo subcommittee chairmanship pursue leadership another panel. We've heard Ander Crenshaw (R-FL), third-ranking Republican panel, eyeing chairmanship expectation Granger would step aside. (Mark Kirk (R-IL), second-ranking Republican subcommittee, elected Tuesday night become junior senator Illinois, seat held Barack Obama.) So would subcommittee chairwoman Granger handle responsibility writing State foreign ops appropriations bill? Here's reported October: Although [Granger] supported bill put forth year current chairwoman Nita Lowey CD-N.Y.), criticizedthe increases foreign-ops budget, saying, "We also face continued concern country economy devastating effects skyrocketing deficits debt." She's strong supporter balanced budget amendment, doesn't bode well foreign-aid funding dismal fiscal environment. Granger also serves defense subcommittee, placing intersection debate balance national security budget shift resources defense diplomacy development. Here seems favor Pentagon, saying June, "I want sure aren't increasing foreign aid expense troops." Her lack support international organizations criticized group Citizens Global Solutions, gave "F" 2007to 2009 rating. Granger also board efforts eliminate aid countries performing internal reform, explained expressing opposition funding Senegalese government State Department's Millennium Challenge Corporation. "We can't give money say put whatever doing," said. The committee leadership assignments won't doled least two three weeks, Hill sources report. But Granger's bid successful, she'll instantly influential. The fiscal 2011 State Foreign Ops bill still completed Congress, despite fiscal year began Oct. 1. The stop gap funding measure funding programs since then, known "continuing resolution," expires December. The lame duck Democratic led Congress unlikely able pass full appropriations bills way door, likely pass another short term continuing resolution. That would leave final work actual bill incoming class led GOP next year. You subscribed email updates The Cable Email delivery powered Google To stop receiving emails, may unsubscribe now.
