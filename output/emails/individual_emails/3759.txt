Just tried emailing sure went -- Missed Shaun, talked COS short ago. She said still details worked Monday. She "wouldn't put full stop it," though things looking good. Tomorrow day they'll reconvene Monday bang last details (hopefully) announce. I'll touch people morning give reports. Will also check DecIan!
