Given recognition importance procurement reform, I thought might like see USAID getting credit making changes already. This right thing getting good press counts. AM Dear Friends Colleagues: What told little-known bureaucratic process called "Implementation Procurement Reform," IPR short, one biggest victories poor people years? It means aid go directly country's systems, making stronger. It also means aid administered local organizations know best communities need. Through IPR, USAID putting President Obama's recent global development policy action. The agency set clear targets increase use local country systems organizations, means US assistance help citizens governments build capacity, instead setting parallel system they've done recent years. They've set clear ambitious targets laser-focused results, dedicated fighting global poverty short term, good.

Ian Bray/OXFAM GB This reform likely criticized think putting money hands local actors expose USAID's programs risk. But precisely point; supporting local change agents—both inside outside developing country governments—can actually strengthen hands people poor countries working change societies better. That means managing risk wisely, rather trying avoid altogether. And field research, 36 39 activists interviewed said want USAID support government's directly, would make easier hold governments accountable prevent corruption. What mean? It means better aid, aid strengthens capacity reformers poor countries. And millions people across world demanding reforms, USAID shown actively listening. Sincerely, The Aid Effectiveness Team p.s.
