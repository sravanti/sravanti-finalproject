The political brain Americans today reflects volatile mixture fear fury, mix together, get explosion. The question point mitigate damage bomb detonates November. The bad news it's late Democrats would good policy good politics (and House actually do), namely pass major jobs bill clear private sector couldn't keep Americans employed. The "Obama Doctrine" Americans want work ability contribute productivity nation right work, private sector can't meet demand jobs, plenty roads bridges fix, new energy sources develop manufacture, schools build renovate kids workers returning training compete 21st century global economy. From spent much last four years testing messages range issues, immigration taxes deficits, I say certainty nothing John Boehner Eric Cantor could say could come within 30 points generating enthusiasm -- particularly among swing voters -- message began, "We don't shortage work ethic country, shortage work." That message resonates across political spectrum. And isn't even strongest message we've tested last weeks months beats back toughest deficit-cutting language side muster. But it's late that. The administration opted alternative doctrine, Larry Summers enunciated This Week several months ago: unemployment going remain high foreseeable future eventually come -- there's nothing -- push small symbolic measures whose symbolism tends escape people work. It's hard excited symbolism children hungry bank repossessing home -- although didn't anything deserve -- people making like bandits. Although situation looks bleak Democrats November, ain't 'til it's over. Republicans shooting foot country, running Tea Party candidates far right can't see Middle America porch. And endangered Democrats likely see victory November understand public mood speak it. What public mood? It characterized single phrase -- populist anger -- cuts across partisan lines. On right, alloyed racial anxiety prejudice. On left, alloyed tremendous disappointment could kind bold leadership times like cry out. And among people vast political center, populist anger alloyed anxiety uncertainty -- jobs, homes, children's future. How Create Populist Explosion: A Tragedy Two Acts So get here? The story told tragedy two acts. Act I: The GOP Sets Country Course Economic Destruction President Calls Truth Reconciliation without Truth Part • A strong economic downturn devolves Great Recession, stock market crashes major banks fail. By October 2008, upper middle class moderate Republicans suburbs frightened what's happening assets they're willing give Democrats chance. • A Republican administration believes neither government regulation creates 700 billion bank bailout accountability. Unlike Republicans, would say "no" situation like let Great Recession turn Great Depression, Democrats right thing, don't make clear start Bush Bailouts remind Americans, over, cause bankruptcies bankruptcy Republican ideology. • A charismatic young president raises people's hopes expectations, uniquely can. Americans frightened, willing waiting hear alternative narrative "government problem, solution" path back economic recovery security. • The White House refuses tell American people three stories desperately need hear. • The first economy gone ditch, it. The president steadfast position "look forward, backward," even GOP blocking every initiative clean mess. As conservative attacks Democrats increase, refuses indict Republicans Congress President Bush destroyed economy putting one eight Americans work one five either behind mortgage process homes foreclosed bankers gambled away. Why need tell American people responsible misery -- repeat again? Because otherwise, worst economic crisis since Great Depression didn't subside within year half, voters would start associate party. This Neuroscience 101 - - it's mental associations formed. But president never even uttered George W. Bush's name first year office, first time mention Bush appoint him, along former President Clinton, co-lead American relief efforts Haiti. The president doesn't like putting antagonists stories, forced to, would cite unnamed "naysayers," "Washington politics usual," "Congress," counterproductive given Congress held party. The guiding belief White House implicit messaging strategy Americans good grasp economics good memories: • The second story American people needed hear president deficit spending essential economy spiraling downward. It's hard story tell, even sound bite. But one best educators occupy Oval Office decades chose educate -- actually once, prodding, never repeated superb explanation --- remind voters every time opponents attacked deficit spending left 1.2 trillion dollar deficit day walked office unpaid-for tax cuts millionaires unpaid-for war Iraq called one sacrifice except soldiers families (and kids grandkids, paying war generations). A year later, Democrats ropes, president started tell story. It right move, appeared defensive hadn't part guiding narrative start. • The third story president needed offer alternative narrative government. The president party offer effective government solution multiple problems 30 years solid branding conservatives since Ronald Reagan government problem. But narrative never came. • The White House Democratic Congress pass virtually economists outside Goldman Sachs-to- Washington pipeline consider half-stimulus predict likely produce half-results. It fulfilled promise. But equally predictable political result discrediting concept government intervention stimulate economy eyes public -- enough scare Democratic lawmakers learned Keynesian economics intro economics indefinite future. Instead blasting Republicans hurled country toward abyss would take drastic measures avert warning American people could easily first two three trillion-dollar packages might needed get Americans back work get gears economy grinding could start returning kinds surpluses Bill Clinton left last time Democrat White House, president chose compromise party unpopular took office 20 percent voters point would even admit pollster considered Republicans -- lowest point GOP since rise public opinion polling 50 years earlier. • The economy continues free-fall, shedding 700,000 jobs month. Meanwhile, Democrats don't take kind dramatic steps necessary stop bleeding. Americans becoming desperate, remain hopeful new president turn things around, perhaps jobs provisions new "stimulus" act cauterize wound. Meanwhile, stimulus portrayed Republicans mixture pork fat, one effectively answering charges, creating increasingly negative associations act never adequately crafted sold. • The logical follow-up bill designed pull economy ditch make bill unnecessary future, attacking Wall Street thrown us crisis passing strong legislation rein excesses created economic meltdown. This would sealed American people's loyalty new president Congress. (Heading November, is, fact, popular piece legislation Democrats passed, took nearly year half get there, then, neither president Democratic Congress enjoyed good average American.) Instead, banks received bailouts foreclosing record rates homeowners whose payroll taxes funded bailouts don't seem get kind attention needs federal government. Adding insult injury, banks double triple credit card interest rates high 30 percent, including people's existing credit card debt -- continuing receive no-interest loans federal government. • Despite talk accountability, one fired (except one auto executive), virtually one prosecuted even investigated far anyone knows, banks received bailouts flaunt record bonuses. Act II: An Anemic Economy Meets Anemic Health Care Plan • The public clamoring health care reform. Over 40 million people don't health insurance all, 85 percent voters health care seen costs double Bush years time real income declined. Effective narratives health care widely available win 2:1 margin toughest Harry-and-Louise anti-reform language side. The opposition knows it, evident leaked memo Republican wordsmith Frank Luntz, warns uphill climb opponents reform, would well accept major elements it. • But instead using well-tested narratives highly effective campaign devising new ones own, administration decides try "sell" health care without narrative. (I wrote detail year ago repeat history here, except telegraphic form.) The president refuses state stands substantive debates health reform year, whether "public option" (a term ill-conceived it's hard believe public supported anyway; imagine support might received called instead "the one health care plan health insurance companies don't get control"). Instead, White House uses phrases "bending cost curve" conservatives flood airwaves evocative phrases "government takeover," "a bureaucrat doctor," "death panels." • Instead using Big Pharma health insurance industry villains health care story, would explain need overhaul rather Band-Aid, White House offers story without protagonists antagonists, cuts secret deals industries become public. • Over interminable months trying get votes Republicans fought Medicare seniors 30 years program popular keep attacking still trying gut Social Security despite popularity, public watches George Will describes "serial bribery" Republican Democratic Senators alike, gets take turn 60th vote. • At 11th hour, compromise plan finally going pass, president nixes idea Medicare-like alternative Americans choose health-insurance industry plan desire, despite 60 percent even swing voters wanting included bill. • Instead signature bill demonstrates Democrats govern effectively government force good working middle class Americans (who told better plans they've negotiated offered years employers "Cadillacs" going taxed existence), entire process proves average American government can't anything right scares moderate Democrats away voting bill would ever put record supporting government spending. • "Government" hits all-time low polls, matching popularity big corporations, CEOs, bailouts. • Populist anger emerges primary emotion across political spectrum, president's job approval swing voters drops high thirties. • Following conventional wisdom, Democrats return all-too-familiar defensive crouch, conclude trouble, tack right. On health care, president Cabinet fan television "reassure" public health care abortion won't covered (thanks reassurance, us didn't find reassuring), domestic partners won't covered, immigrants won't covered. None issues needed conceded. (I know I tested messages them, well- messaged progressive positions would boosted popularity bill swing voters.) • The White House starts adopting failed conservative policies talking points leave public utterly confused president, extension, party, stands central issues day. The president talks cutting deficits increasing spending breath, using metaphor families tightening belt tough times, strengthens resolve stimulating faltering economy; pledges support massively expanding offshore drilling "clean coal" (which doesn't exist, way) speech climate change; sends 1200 additional National Guards Arizona apparent reward passing "No Latino Left Behind," publicly objecting legislation. • The underlying psychological assumption moves mix policies right left equal parts, win center. In fact, one ever won center way. It appears weak, opportunistic, incoherent average swing voter, particularly problematic time people center desperately want know leaders vision coherent plan (which FDR Ronald Reagan effective moving voters center). It doesn't win votes right. But one predictable effect: It sucks motivation base, feel demoralized betrayed (if they're part "professional left") less likely vote (if they're average voters don't follow politics carefully don't feel enthusiastic anymore, even don't really know why). • Capping off, BP disaster occurs two weeks president adopted "drill here, drill now," "all above" position Republican Party oil companies. This could perfect opportunity go offensive, contrast Democrats stand (common sense, protection safety, land leave children, key American industries jobs, sticking ordinary Americans big businesses lobbyists) Republicans stand for; connect dots happened Wall Street (with regulators owned operated companies supposed regulate) happened Gulf (where precisely thing happened). Instead, administration finds defensive, increasingly sounding like subsidiary BP, allowing BP call shots control information weeks, defending increasingly hard-to-believe statistics, issuing press releases appear indistinguishable issued BP inconsistent assessments independent scientists. Where Do We Go Here? So find today: Democratic Party Democratic base demoralized unlikely vote high numbers November; Republican Party selling replanted Bushes tremendous enthusiasm; vast political center filled voters utterly confused unsure turn certain things aren't going well. In January 2009 one could predicted Democrats would predicament today. Perhaps Democrats might lose seats lost off-year election, certainly that. We seen -- American public knew seen -- disastrous performance president party living history, American people elected tremendously charismatic young president enormous Democratic majorities houses Congress. They given president Congress strong mandate whatever kind change necessary get us economic free-fall put Americans back work. But red flags already end Obama's first week office led offer following advice new administration: Tell story got mess you'll it. Tell coherent story deficit spending. Re-brand government there's one story (Reagan's), it's one supports progressive agenda. Never let attacks go unanswered, emboldens opposition leads public believe answers them. And throw bipartisan party one comes, don't throw another one. All followed predictable unfortunate. A year half later, White House hasn't consistently done things, although President intermittently them, does, well. The question today whether Democrats channel populist anger seeing around country late game. The answer we'd better try. Having recently tested messages economics jobs, including talk deficits taxes -- widely assumed Democrats' Achilles Heel, particularly -- little question Democrats progressives center left simply say believe ways evocative, values-driven, speak people's worries 'anger, many stand good chance surviving November, particularly opponents nothing say warmed-over rhetoric cutting taxes millionaires multinationals fiscal restraint except cuts profits campaign contributors. Even evocative boilerplate conservative messages fall flat honest messages speak need get Americans working again. And issue issue, message resonant right one sides working middle class Americans small business owners special interests, big business, lobbyists. But actions speak louder words, Americans want see action. It may late kind jobs bill seen year half ago, isn't late Democrats go offensive Republicans - - virtually -- opposed extending unemployment insurance millions Americans thrown work Republicans' corporate sponsors. It isn't late Democrats contrast support highly popular aid state local governments saved jobs hundreds thousands teachers, firefighters, police country Republicans' desire throw onto street. It isn't late make voting issue bill Republicans stalling would give small businesses fighting chance economy stacked them, make clear one party stands small businesses, create 75 percent new jobs country, party stands big businesses outsource American jobs offshore profits avoid paying fair share American taxes. It's late pass bill would limit credit card interest rates reasonable percent rate credit made available credit card companies. It's late pass first badly need "fix" health care reform act demonstrate Americans Democrats mean say first step, namely law stops insurance companies increasing premiums 40 percent cutting size networks 50-75 percent, violates principles affordability choice essential efforts sell health care reform public. It's late vow change rules Senate prevent use filibuster give every special interest veto power every important piece legislation. It's late introduce legislation that's hold House Senate guarantee fair elections, voice everyday Americans heard voice special interests finance political campaigns. On every one issues, strong populist message trounces anything side say. But Democrats need play offense. They need take up-or-down votes bill bill, including expect side block, knowing every one votes leverage campaign ad behind it. They need change narrative sounds average American like whiny impotent one -- "the Republicans won't let us it" -- narrative strength numbers shared constituents. And need make every election choice two well-articulated approaches governance -- offer articulation sides' positions values. That leads final point. What Democrats needed offer American people clear narrative led country mess find today clear vision lead us out. That narrative would laid roadmap elected officials voters alike, rather making legislative issue seemingly discrete turn onto dirt road. That narrative might included -- include today -- key elements: economy tumbling, it's role leadership government stop free-fall; Wall Street gambling financial security, homes, jobs, true leaders sit back helplessly wax eloquent aboUt free market, take away dice; private sector can't create jobs people want work, we'll put Americans back work rebuilding roads, bridges, schools; Big Oil preventing us competing China's wind solar energy programs, we'll eliminate tax breaks lead dysfunctional investments 19th century fuels public-private partnership companies create clean, safe fuels 21st century millions good American jobs follow. That's Democrats stand for. It's time said it.
