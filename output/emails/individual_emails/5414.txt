Top 2 Civilians Face Rockiness Afghan Shift By MARK LANDLER The New York Times Thu, July 1, 2010 WASHINGTON — As General David H. Petraeus takes command Afghanistan, two top American civilian officials war face uncertain tricky future, working newly empowered military leader, gaze impatient president put notice fractious war council needs pull together. Richard C. Holbrooke, Obama administration's special representative region, Karl W. Eikenberry, ambassador Afghanistan, hung jobs uproar followed Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal's career- ending quotes Rolling Stone magazine. But privately, least one senior White House official suggested using General McChrystal's exit excuse housecleaning, according senior officials. That rejected disruptive military campaign relies heavily civilian support, people said. In recent days, administration officials begun floating idea Ambassador Eikenberry might replaced Ryan C. Crocker, highly regarded former ambassador Iraq forged close partnership General Petraeus successful Iraq troop increase. Such prospect viewed remote, given Mr. Crocker's prestigious new post Texas A&M University. But fact name invoked underlines challenges confront Ambassador Eikenberry, adapts new partner — one strong ideas soldiers diplomats work together war. It also illustrates remarkably powerful role General Petraeus assume nine-year-old war, setting almost viceroy Afghanistan key broker negotiations President Hamid Karzai Pakistan eventual political settlement. Prior General Petraeus's arrival, critics said White House created problem recruiting several forceful, ambitious personalities giving jobs overlapping responsibilities. Administration officials acknowledge that, one said, "There obviously number substantial personalities team." But White House believes current lineup mesh, difficult war demands much talent. Still, McChrystal blow-up reverberated State Department. Secretary State Hillary Rodham Clinton instructed Ambassador Eikenberry Mr. Holbrooke take hard look civilian team, two officials said. She wedded current lineup continues bog internecine battles, said. "You can't major shift civ-mil structure without civilian side take step back look everything," said senior State Department official, using jargon civilian-military campaign. Be General Petraeus, whose appointment approved 99-0 Senate Wednesday, took pains confirmation hearing Tuesday back unified civilian military effort. He noted telephoned Mr. Holbrooke would rendezvous Ambassador Eikenberry Brussels, two could land Kabul together. "Holbrooke wingman, great degree," General Petraeus said interview. "We had, have, good relationship." That role, said, fall Ambassador Eikenberry. Ambassador Eikenberry highly critical Pentagon's proposal last year send 60,000 additional troops Afghanistan, led difficult relationship General McChrystal. But fact General Petraeus true architect plan. The ambassador, retired lieutenant general former commander Afghanistan, graduated West Point 1973, year ahead General Petraeus, know academy. The two share scholarly bent: General Petraeus holds Ph.D. Princeton, Ambassador Eikenberry Master's degrees Harvard Stanford. While never assigned together, careers intersected twice. In Iraq, General Eikenberry led assessment Iraqi security forces General Petraeus commanding 101st Airborne Division Mosul. When General Eikenberry commander Afghanistan, General Petraeus led assessment Afghan National Security Forces. General Petraeus declined discuss personnel issues, Ambassador Eikenberry Mr. Holbrooke turned requests interview. Mr. Crocker, dean George Bush School Government Texas A&M, return call comment. For Mr. Holbrooke, new landscape challenging ways. Officials said job security less doubt six months ago, ouster subject endless Washington chatter. Yet arguably become less central player: Jacob J. Lew, deputy secretary state, manages much civilian influx Afghanistan Mr. Holbrooke helped shape, embassy Kabul carrying out. Mr. Holbrooke's current portfolio played weaknesses, allies admit. He best high-level negotiator, comfortable nitty-gritty work helping Afghanistan build economy. These days, Mr. Holbrooke become globe-trotting diplomat, trying retain flagging European allies seeking draw influential Muslim countries like Egypt helping Afghanistan. At recent conference 35 countries Madrid, Mr. Holbrooke drummed support allies Afghan government's campaign reintegrate Taliban fighters mainstream society. Mr. Karzai's longer-term effort reconcile Taliban leaders, negotiations Pakistan, could propel Mr. Holbrooke back central role. Were talks become serious, several officials said, Mr. Holbrooke's negotiating skills could put use, broker guardian American interests. For now, though, evidence General Petraeus's influence, shuttling Kabul Islamabad. On last visit region, Mr. Holbrooke met Mr. Karzai senior Pakistani officials, including army chief staff, Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. Mr. Holbrooke's past run-ins Mr. Karzai, several officials said, hindered ability deal Afghan leader, Pakistani officials said trusted him. Husain Haqqani, Pakistan's ambassador Washington, said Mr. Holbrooke took time understand Pakistan's concerns. "Ambassador Holbrooke liked some, admired others seen effective, even may like him," Mr. Haqqani said. Still, General Petraeus indisputably key player, wasted time asserting control. On secure videoconference call last Saturday, person familiar call said, General Petraeus threw support behind costly, controversial, plan install temporary generators supply electricity Kandahar, Taliban stronghold next major American military target. Mr. Holbrooke Ambassador Eikenberry swiftly assented.
