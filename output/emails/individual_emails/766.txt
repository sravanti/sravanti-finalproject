Central Daylight Time Subj: Left Gate - blog Monday, September 14, 2009 Odds On Big A <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/09/odds-on-big.html> Even Governor Paterson reportedly recommendation Aqueduct racino hand (this reader says actually two consider <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/09/sunday-morning-notes-and- nuts.html#comment-1156672372250588546> ), least one bidders still taking case local community around track. The Queens Chronicle reported last week <http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=20368289&BRD=2731&PAG=461&dept_id=574908&rfi=6> SL Green/Hard Rock made presentation Thursday. "Hard Rock right balance," [Pres/CEO Marc] Holliday said. "Its recognized brand quality entertainment attract younger older players across stratum. People flying JFK say, 'I hear there's Hard Rock, I want see it." One group's big pitches they'll first generate revenue stream ("shovel-ready, ground, day award.") And thanks reader alerted us article Crain's <http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20090913/FREE/309139964> which, importantly comprising yet another virtual press release Steve Wynn, contains, towards bottom, handy pocket guide six bidders, financial portion bids (or least known them), ups downs proposals. This tough call; handicapping without Form I said before. I can't say I favorite; neither particular personal preference, clue likely winner. But I'll give shot take Crain's piece one step coming morning line. <http://1.bp.blogspot.com/yiJ1ri4LCfk/Sq2_nTNU jI/AAAAAAAABHM/UucITWnkilM/s1600- h/dont_bother.jpg> Aqueduct Entertainment Group <http://www.aqueductentertainment.comk (3-1): Competitive bid $251 million (contingent 7,650 machines; $301 million 10,000), plethora local connections real estate/construction side, approval local unions could compensate lack brand name recognition gaming partner The Navegante Group. Presence Senator Malcolm Smith's longtime confidante Rev. Floyd Flake doesn't hurt either. SL Green/Hard Rock (4-1) - Boosted bid $275 million, Hard Rock brand name mentioned above. Manhattan-based realtor SL Green endorsed several local unions <http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3601/is_43_54/ai_n27894917/> . But, mentioned Crain's, passed favor Delaware North first time around. Aqueduct Gaming (6-1), Buffalo-based Delaware North's group, rallied late stepped-up publicity effort major community initiative <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/08/back-in-game.html> appearing indifferent early (though it's original $100 million upfront offer remains intact additional $200 million follow). The addition Harrah's <http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Aqueduct-Gaming-L1c-1034906.html> adds experienced operator interesting cross-marketing twist probably allowed now- disappeared MOU. And, like two bidders above, Aqueduct Gaming reported reached accommodations unions. So I listed third choice merits. However, part wants list rank outsider - I'd pretty damn shocked state goes back company dropped failing raise money last time. And, I've mentioned several times, given reports investigation <http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/05/01/2009-05- 01_attorney_general_andrew_cuomo_subpoenas_contracts_won_by_clients_offirm_tied_to.html> Attorney General Andrew Cuomo lobbyist Patricia Lynch's dealings Assembly Speaker, I don't know involvement going help hurt. Steve Wynn (8-1) offered $300 million, bidder six contenders receive bad grade hotel unions <http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storylD=838256&category=STATE> reported Jim Odato Times Union last week. Whatsmore, scale building proposal <http://www.queenstribune.com/news/1250798405.html> laughably ridiculous, wouldn't ready 2011. He'd favorite decision based number newspaper online articles <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/08/all-wynn-all-of-time.html> bidder featured in. But, quite simply, sometimes comes nut <http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/cindy_adams/wynn_hopes_to_win_racefor_race_hzqJ384wLxUSxFKsUWiSyM> . Penn National (12-1) might worth ducat long odds. No local connection makes dark horse. But $250 million bid (as reported elsewhere <http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/17717/penn-national- lobbies-up/> though Crain's piece) puts ballgame, company experienced gaming operator solid balance sheet <http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/aug2009/pi20090814_742719.htm> would probably competent job anyone else. R. Donahue Peebles/MGM Mirage (20-1) didn't increase $150 million bid, doesn't lobbyist; good luck that. Whatsmore, local flavor MGM Mirage well-publicized financial woes (though things looking late <http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125212120561188377.html> ). Would major surprise.
