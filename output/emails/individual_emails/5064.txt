Are Mideast Policy Team! Leslie H. Gelb July 7, 2010 I 2:38pm I ri==IPresident Barack Obama meets Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Oval Office White House, July 6, 2010. (Gary Fabiano / Sipa Press) Obama's bow Netanyahu latest series disastrous missteps U.S. policy toward Israel. Leslie H. Gelb who's blame—and White House get back course. Whoever advised President Obama flay Israel publicly week fired. Only advisers experience dealing Israel could believed Israeli leaders like Prime Minister Netanyahu would bow public attacks. And whoever advised Mr. Obama kneel rhetorically Mr. Netanyahu public Tuesday also fired. The thing accomplished embarrassing tactic put Israel position call shots Mideast policy rest Obama's first term. The real enemy negotiated settlement Mideast time; it's failure. Were culprits non-foreign policy White House intimates — chief staff Rahm Emanuel political honcho David Axelrod? Axelrod knows nothing this, worse, Emanuel thinks lived Israel. Was George Mitchell, president's Mideast negotiator, brains behind foolishness? Surely, he's enough experience working Israelis know better. Did General James Jones, National Security Adviser, remain silent, again? And course, Secretary State Hillary Clinton? Strangely someone adept pleasing Israel's constituents America, spent lot time past year publicly beating Israeli leaders. Has led astray pro- Arab contingent State Department? •Martin Indyk: New Hope Mideast Peace •Peter Beinart: Netanyahu's Latest Insult Or guilty party none President Obama himself? The find makes decisions White House every subject nuclear weapons coloring Easter eggs, turns man Oval Office himself. He's expert. He's decider. He invites everyone state piece peace, tells — seemingly without question, bidding. Mr. Obama started White House tenure near-zero base foreign policy knowledge experience Middle East. It easy enough guess blissful state earliest decisions. He came box demanding Israel agree suspend construction West Bank precondition direct negotiations Palestinians. Anyone knew anything situation surely would told president chances Mr. Netanyahu agreeing "proposal" zero, minus zero. No Israeli leader, even dovish one, would ever dream beginning negotiations conceding major bargaining card. As teenagers say, Obama advisers thinking? And yes, Israelis publicly humiliated Vice President Biden trip Holy Land announcing would start new construction East Jerusalem, Washington respond vehemently. The Israelis arrogant stupid one. They weakened American power region. No U.S. president could let get away it. Clinton others made strong public statements criticism, fine. But Mr. Obama allowed Mr. Netanyahu come ahead planned visit D.C. — publicly humiliated him. The U.S. president let Israeli prime minister cool heels hours meeting him, wouldn't shake hand departed. There's surer way unite nation behind leader, even controversial one like Netanyahu, foreign leader humiliate him. This brilliant tactic — thought Obama's advisers president — accomplished two things. It stiffened Israeli backs even conciliatory starting talks Palestinians. The Israeli government cave American pressures. It also galvanized Israeli supporters United States — particular within conservative parts Jewish community Republican Party. There went Mr. Obama's support pressing Israel even private. To top Tuesday's meeting, full smiles adoption Israeli-desired language almost every topic, made matters worse. It made situation look American president cowed Jewish control . . American politics. That certainly pleased American Israeli hawks, please others want see genuine progress Mideast talks. There time place Washington put pressure Israel. Mr. Obama team picked every wrong time place. The right occasion squeeze negotiations reached point sides given must give close deal. Only point pressure make sense. All parties would get real shot peace return concessions. To sure, many ask point — How get point? The answer browbeat parties scurry negotiating table. That tactic simply never pays off. The answer build conditions beyond negotiating table, conditions political community Israel Palestine, would support compromises table. The British' pushed Catholics Protestants make concessions year year, fail time again, inflame feelings around spur greater violence. Finally, London focused getting Protestant Catholic women form common groups support compromise. London much various business communities evolved backers mutual concessions well. Only parties know support compromises, negotiations got somewhere, reached agreement. That's needs done Israel Palestinians. We hear time enemy peace Middle East time, time running out. Perhaps caused Mr. Obama team misstep badly; think it's race clock. Do something fail. But real enemy negotiated settlement Mideast time; it's failure. Neither Israel Palestinians United States afford fail again. After yet another failure, could well result perpetual violence. To set Arab-Israeli policy sensible course, Mr. Obama needs search new advisors know get things done Middle East, hire them, listen them. Leslie H.
