Just wanted sure saw Kurtzer op-ed, ran Sunday Post. Kudos Jonathan Prince getting written placed. The Settlements Facts â€¢ By Daniel Kurtzer Sunday, June 14, 2009 Faulty analysis Israeli settlement issue passed fact. Charles Krauthanuner's June 5 column, "The Settlements Myth," one example. Here facts: In 2003, Israeli government accepted, reservations, "road map" peace, imposed two requirements Israel regarding settlements: "GO! [Government Israel] immediately dismantles settlement outposts erected since March 2001. Consistent Mitchell Report, GOI freezes settlement activity (including natural growth settlements)." Today, Israel maintains three events -- namely, draft understandings discussed 2003 Prime Minister Ariel Sharon U.S. deputy national security adviser Stephen Hadley; President George W. Bush's April 14, 2004, letter Sharon; April 14 letter Sharon adviser Dov Weissglas national security adviser Condoleezza Rice -- constitute formal understanding United States accepted continuing Israeli building within "construction line" settlements. The problem understanding. The first event Israelis cite 2003 discussions four-part draft included notion construction within settlements might permitted confined already built-up areas settlements. The idea draw line around outer perimeter built-up areas settlements allow building inside line. This draft never codified, effort made define line around built-up areas settlements. Nonetheless, Israel began act largely accordance reading provisions, probably believing U.S. silence conferred assent. Second, President Bush's 2004 letter conveyed U.S. support agreed outcome negotiations Israel would retain "existing major Israeli population centers" West Bank "on basis mutually agreed changes. . . ." One key provisions letter U.S. support Israel's retaining settlements predicated "agreed outcome" negotiations. Despite Israel's contention letter allowed continue building large settlement blocs Ariel, Maale Adumim Gush Etzion, letter convey U.S. support understanding Israeli settlement activities areas run-up peace agreement. In 2004 letter Rice, Weissglas addressed issue "construction line," saying "within agreed principles settlement activities, effort made next days better definition construction line settlements Judea & Samaria." However, never "agreed principles settlement activities." Moreover, effort define "construction line" never consummated: Israel United States discussed briefly reach agreement definition construction line settlements. Weissglas's letter also promised "continuous action" remove unauthorized outposts, Israel removed almost none them. Throughout period, Bush administration regularly protest Israel's continuing settlement activity. But different arguing United States agreed it. In recent days, former senior Bush administration officials told journalists background understandings existed Israel regarding continued settlement activity. Commentators also focus Obama administration's reiteration freeze must include "natural growth" settlements. Krauthammer says "means strangling death thriving towns close 1949 armistice line. . . It means increase population. Which means babies." This nonsense. No one suggests Israelis stop babies. Rather, blessing new baby translate right build apartments houses settlements. The two issues nothing other. Israelis, like Americans, move time life circumstances -- children, jobs, housing availability -- change. The pattern population growth territories actually undercuts natural-growth argument. Since 1993, Israel signed Oslo Accords, Israel's West Bank settler population grown 116,300 289,600. The numbers East Jerusalem increased 152,800 186,000. This goes far beyond natural increase families already living settlements. Inserting provision "natural growth" official documents started 2001 Mitchell Report 2003 "road map," reflecting recognition concept abused justification expanding settlements. The Obama administration pursuing policies every administration since 1967 articulated -- settlements jeopardize possibility achieving peace thus settlement activity stop. This diminish Palestinians' responsibilities, especially commitment stop violence terrorism uproot terrorist infrastructure. President Obama emphasized Cairo speech. But Palestinian failures no" way justify Israeli failure implement road map commitments respect settlements outposts. It time Israel freeze settlement activity dismantle unauthorized outposts.
