Cc: Cheryl, Doug, Justin There context section bottom, longer I would like, I think important articulate I saw I spoke (and I didn't see I didn't meet) understand data set clear limitations. To say I profoundly disturbed I saw - didn't see - would understatement. The incompetence mind numbing. Not incidentally, rained twice I there. If quickly change organization, management, accountability delivery paradigm ground, could quite conceivably confront tens thousands children's deaths diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid water-related diseases near future. Below major takeaways nascent/early thoughts (however define we) could drive significant incremental improvements ground near longer term. As often said, I time - less emotion - I would written shorter letter. I hope mini-behemoth rife grammatical errors inadvertent gaps; I sorry either true. Please forward whole part attributed without asking first - happy invisible soldier. Mainly hope even marginally helpful. Thanks, Chelsea Takeaways below, illustrative examples, logical flow, order importance. Bolded I think important.: Haitians want help want international community help help - sounds obvious wasn't UN International NGO (INGO) folks I ran across. The UN people I encountered frequently touch (e.g., would Logbase days - ever), anachronistic best arrogant incompetent worst (e.g., one woman UN -UNDP I think - told waiting Haitians "demand political rights" - they're asking tents, latrines, soap, food getting that....) In fact, Haitians settlements much organizing themselves, part help define needs articulate UN/ INGO community. Fairly nuanced settlement governance structures already developed. The largest settlement I visited Parc Jean Marie Vincent (40k counting) overall governing committee head governing committee (voted governing committee); women's committee; security committee; sanitation committee (with soap subcommittee), etc. Women comprised 50% committee. One illuminating anecdotes trip talking head security committee settlement residents, including 2 women governing committee. The security committee wanted 100 tshirts - least though I think they'll need least 2-3x - security volunteers could wear patrolling people, particularly women, would feel safe saw approach groups 2 3. They also ideally wanted flashlights also use night patrol. Finally, wanted able pay security team (though less important first two 'asks'). IF option feasible, second choice US Army come settlement patrol night. Not Haitian police (unreliable) UN (dismissed). They wanted help themselves, wanted reliability accountability. The settlements' governing bodies - shared - beginning experience UN/ INGO fatigue given often articulate needs, willingness work - little coming way. Tents latrines / sanitation remain largest urgent needs - obvious anyone minimum knowledge public health settlement residents The Haitian government appears emergent, albeit still largely lacking specifics, plan action (detailed below), near (to get next 6-12 months) longer term (while rebuilding next -5 years) The Haitian government's inability articulate plan quickly enough sufficient terms UN/ INGO community lead proliferation ad hoc efforts UN INGOs 'help,' helped (e.g., met one worried water supplies camps even though it's motley crue French Red Cross, Oxfam, IMO/IOM, etc achieved that), hurt (e.g., largest settlement visited 1 latrine every 1,000 people 40 -40k though given settlements' growth rate probably 40 -45k today; 1 every 50 people 800+ latrines) happened (e.g., settlements lights night areas lights continue work; settlement Petionville Golf Club, instance, lights night sit darkness) This disorganization across UN/ INGOs variety effects Haitian government, including visibly distanced UN Cluster process (e.g., instead going meeting day Haitian Minister Health going week - "such waste time" said representative government's current modus operandi); though heard cluster process improving - I asked concrete example how, I told meetings "more efficient." This lack efficiency - mention lack visible consistent progress - also lead distrust UN/ INGOs Haitian government Haitian people settlements. The former feels like shows effect - latter feels like actor(s) reliably show Again, UN seemed best chaotic worst absent I travelled around action-oriented sense - I saw IOM/IMO tents settlements workers evidence work; evidence WHO; evidence OSHA; evidence of... You get picture. I see lots UN peacekeepers riding around however vans, humvees, etc. Though point trucks, I asked many trucks country - including non-Port Au Prince UN 'bases' - one could tell me. There appears NO accessible usable UN inventory system logistics operation. WFP, instance, largely piggy backing US Army/ SOUTHCOM "UN" / OSHA could tell many trucks WFP had, much less many UN had. I counted - I kid - hundreds trucks cars UN logbase UN bases drove UNICEF UN agency seemed universally acknowledged good job settlements' residents, Haitian doctors INGO partners, perhaps part narrowly defined agenda currently Haiti (vaccinations) reliable - i.e., shows says settlements central locations There NO accountability UN system international humanitarian system (including for/ among INGOs), new news one area Cluster approach aimed remedy - e.g., feedback mechanism British Red Cross dug 34 40 latrines 3 feet deep didn't tell residents would come extract latrines properly train people take care latrines, etc. - malpractice continuum appalling British Red Cross know betterâ€”at least, British Red Cross subsequently allowed dig elsewhere/ 'do' latrines The cash-for-work program UN heralds working optimally, put mildly. It currently focuses - perhaps solely - debris cleaning - important doubt - extended work settlements helped set standardized, differentiated wages, settlement work. For instance, UN cash work program already started pay people organized camps - clean latrines; 'guard' latrines, including insuring kids use soap; teachers; security patrol; evacuation duty; work WFP XYZ drop times, etc.... NONE happening far I tell. When cash work program head still focused - appeared - rubble cleaning. Re: education settlements beyond: This theoretically responsibility UNICEF Save Children - I heard they're starting work I know. Ad hoc schools begun camps. We met woman - host fact - working Israeli Agency International Development Cooperation - started schools 4 settlements least next month. The World Food Program continues NOT buy locally - probably moot point appears dairy, fruit, vegetable grain stores spoiled. The WFP also seems rather erratic early days people I spoke said WFP systematic reliable food delivery. However, yet started deliver cooking eating utensils though promised next week. In contrast UN, appears respect US Military ground - Army particularly branch people see guarding hospital - negative comment UN forces given effective absence. I saw anti-US graffiti though walls covered parts downtown anti 'ONG' (NGO) anti-UN graffiti. (Also, graffiti writers sentiments; one Haitian doctors I met said, "We must poor can't tell [UN INGOs] - kick use money ourselves."). There also great fear - least Haitian ex-pat medical community- Army leaving soon largely security total organization vacuum would left around hospital. The UN community, contrast, seem perturbed prospect. On unrelated note, absence Catholic Church's efforts notable, particularly given high death toll among priests, nuns seminarians. Catholic Relief Services present. Thoughts needed - could below. (I know much familiar.): The Office Special Envoy - i.e., Dad - needs authority UN myriad parts - I believe would give effective authority much INGO sphere given persistently collective humanitarian community holding onto cluster approach. I know know working it. OSHA clearly failing ground, otherwise could "empowered" ostensibly already is. However, regardless attachment clusters, needs single point authority either UN / INGO efforts ground organized one two principle ways: either expertise areas (e.g., latrines, lights) settlements/ Port Au Prince regions constituent settlements, full structures - e.g., finance, procurement, project management etc., understanding certain functional areas would cross- cutting (e.g., pay work) There needs coordinated logistics effort follow urgency procurement deployment latrines, tents lights - needed support installment, servicing, maintenance, etc each. In parallel, new logistics center/ warehouse coordinating facility built; every non-UN logistics-focused person I talked said need exists new logistic center near major seaport. A plan must developed rainy season, already us, particularly settlements include answers questions like people evacuate rains? How access food water latrines, minimum, spaces? Also, could places multipurpose, e.g., also schools clinic tents/semi permanent structures (one engineer talked fiberglass?)? On pay work, UN needs expand mandate coordinate relevant INGO partners start employing people, differential wages, settlements coordinate groups ensure consistent wages 'market' could develop The UN - IMO/IOM - someone needs take monthly census settlements minimum Speaking censuses, UN also needs census materials country - including peacekeeper bases outside Port Au Prince. For example, drove 2 bases way Cange collectively, I would estimate, hundred trucks buses sitting two, well least 800 Napali soldiers (according locals) laying effectively fallow - I don't think anyone expects outbreak violence Central Plateau near future even colleagues deployed UN Charter Chapter 6, surely preserving peace could interpreted work settlements? At least, hardware could used effectively Port Au Prince Special/ extraordinary management needed around areas received significant attention offers assistance, e.g., general hospital Port Au Prince multiple actors, including Sarkozy, offered rebuild Holistically, support Haitian government actually ostensibly undermine authority also help augment build local capacity capabilities, feasible The UN/ INGO look source locally work local partners whenever possible, post emergency phase least. For example, work local solar light producers, buy local t-shirt factories (if survived outside Port Au Prince), mandate WFP first look local producers, etc. Now bias I think quickest production medium term accommodate local dimension Re: USNS Comfort: long there, minimum, mission expanded military civilian staff could work physical therapy earthquake related victims ideally care non-earthquake related cases. Re: US Army: If mission largely coming end, I hope succession plan current tasks, e.g., hospital security, Haitian government comfortable with; currently Haitian government/ least Haitian government people proverbial ground idea transfer plan Re: medical evacuations: think improved given collectively- experienced chaos Sunday Re: mental health settlements beyond: clear people thinking - largely Dad asked made prominent - still unclear action plan Re: Haitian plan: I sure it's best plan, plan work government flush details robust actionable - sure probably Re: Catholic church: Could reach Vatican - even Catholic groups/ prominent Catholics domestically raise money necessary expertise rebuild central cathedral main seminary? It would powerful symbolic statement - put lots people work Re: status, including mental health workers there, Haitian ex-pat: I consciously leaving I can't process right FYI: Emergent Haitian government plan action, I understand it: o Near term/ next year â–  Buttress settlements currently exist lowest lying flood plans, i.e., get tents latrines place, ensure sufficient amounts clean water flowing brought, ensure food supplies sufficient, ensure security safety (though seems people-focused only); ensure medical care accessible; start schools least youngest children. â–ª Move people settlements worst geographies flooding practical reasons/ reasons (e.g., one currently 4000 people prime minister's lawn) pre-constructed tent settlements elsewhere - built first already INGO Shelter Box though apparently tents put close one another â€¢ Areas lacking mention I heard discussed: solution ensure people somewhere go heavy rains come; ensure continuity key services rains come; solution ensure people paid ensure sufficient light camps, clearly critical security (rapes skyrocketing I know least 2 murders one camp Saturday night); right spec tent - housing, clinic, evacuation, school could multipurpose; plan older children/young adults may old initial school plan; best support / help create needed settlement governance; census, semi-regular basis, settlements Â® Over next 6-12 months: o Assess homes sufficiently safe families return subsequently encourage so; government estimates â€”30% homes/families (though seems guess, i.e., evidence base) â€¢ Build semi-permanent settlements augment pre- existing villages around Port Au Prince feasible enable government move people settlements sites. End goal move 400-1000 families needed o Longer-term: â€¢ Rebuilt Port Au Prince though unclear how/if/why people would move back government's post-rebuild vision looks like â–  Build robust health, education etc systems existed earthquake â–  *Clearly less well-defined part "plan" Context I spent last four days Haiti. I Paul Farmer (Paul) Partners Health (PIH) entire time - Port Au Prince Thursday, Friday Sunday afternoon PIH sites Laconville Cange, Central Plateau region Saturday Sunday morning. I sat Paul's formal meetings Port Au Prince with: Haitian Minister Health Alex Larsen team; Haitian government official ostensibly overseeing reconstruction efforts/ UN liaison Leslie Voltaire; x-UN group preparing PDNA (post disaster needs assessment) conference New York end March working giving 'voice voiceless,' i.e., designated 15minutes conference highlight voices affected (the 15 minutes I gather happening Cheryl Paul), UNDP, UNHCR others represented; group interested building logistics center reconstruction efforts, i.e., outside UN ambit, including people Royal Caribbean, McKinsey people traveling with, including Wes Edens, CEO Fortress supporter PIH - person donated, continues donate space Miami airport PIH, Clinton Foundation, University Miami Medical Center others using move goods air sea, via transfer, Haiti. Informally, I talked with: people settlements settlement committee heads, translator; local Haitian doctors; ex-pat PIH doctors mobile clinics settlements; doctors, nurses US police officers I ran street, dinner, ad hoc residence abandoned Aristide Foundation; Maryse Kedar hosted us nights Port Au Prince, member local elite, ad hoc Israel volunteers (from Israeli Agency International Development Cooperation, ie USAID, mentioned above); broad swath people serving USNS Comfort, ship; US Army enlisted officers whenever I saw them; Louise Ivers, head PIH Haiti, others met ran along way.
