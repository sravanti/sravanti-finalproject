H: I'm sure preoccupied adventures Lula, et al. Nonetheless, article below, posted NY Review, soon published, breakthrough piece large impact. It's worth reading, least Frank Luntz's poll numbers. The hysterical tone much Israeli leadership US Jewish community partly rooted long-term profound development. Sid http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/jun/10/failure-american-jewish-establishment/ The Failure American Jewish Establishment June 10, 2010 Peter Beinart E-mail Single Page Share More Peter Beinart anjamin Netanyahu; drawing John Springs In 2003, several prominent Jewish philanthropists hired Republican pollster Frank Luntz explain American Jewish college students vigorously rebutting campus criticism Israel. In response, unwittingly produced damning indictment organized American Jewish community I ever seen. The philanthropists wanted know Jewish students thought Israel. Luntz found mostly didn't. "Six times brought Jewish youth together group talk Jewishness connection Israel," reported. "Six times topic Israel come prompted. Six times Jewish youth used word 'they' rather than'us` describe situation." That Luntz encountered indifference surprising. In recent years, several studies revealed, words Steven Cohen Hebrew Union College An Kelman University California Davis, "non-Orthodox younger Jews, whole, feel much less attached Israel elders," many professing "a near-total absence positive feelings." In 2008, student senate Brandeis, nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored university America, rejected resolution commemorating sixtieth anniversary Jewish state. Luntz's task figure gone wrong. When probed students' views Israel, hit firm beliefs. First, "they reserve right question Israeli position." These young Jews, Luntz explained, "resist anything see 'group think." They want "open frank" discussion Israel flaws. Second, "young Jews desperately want peace." When Luntz showed series ads, one popular entitled "Proof Israel Wants Peace," listed offers various Israeli governments withdraw conquered land. Third, "some empathize plight Palestinians." When Luntz displayed ads depicting Palestinians violent hateful, several focus group participants criticized stereotypical unfair, citing Muslim friends. Most students, words, liberals, broadly defined. They imbibed defining values American Jewish political culture: belief open debate, skepticism military force, commitment human rights. And innocence, realize supposed shed values came Israel. The kind Zionism found attractive Zionism recognized Palestinians deserving dignity capable peace, quite willing condemn Israeli government share beliefs. Luntz grasp irony. The kind Zionism found attractive kind American Jewish establishment working lives. Among American Jews today, great many Zionists, especially Orthodox world, people deeply devoted State Israel. And great many liberals, especially secular Jewish world, people deeply devoted human rights people, Palestinians included. But two groups increasingly distinct. Particularly younger generations, fewer fewer American Jewish liberals Zionists; fewer fewer American Jewish Zionists liberal. One reason leading institutions American Jewry refused foster—indeed, actively opposed—a Zionism challenges Israel's behavior West Bank Gaza Strip toward Arab citizens. For several decades, Jewish establishment asked American Jews check liberalism Zionism's door, now, horror, finding many young Jews checked Zionism instead. Morally, American Zionism downward spiral. If leaders groups like AIPAC Conference Presidents Major American Jewish Organizations change course, wake one day find younger, Orthodox- dominated, Zionist leadership whose naked hostility Arabs Palestinians scares even them, mass secular American Jews range apathetic appalled. Saving liberal Zionism United States—so American Jews help save liberal Zionism Israel—is great American Jewish challenge age. And starts Luntz's students wanted start: talking frankly Israel's current government, longer averting eyes. Since 1990s, journalists scholars describing bifurcation Israeli society. In words Hebrew University political scientist Yaron Ezrahi, "After decades came called national consensus, Zionist narrative liberation [has] dissolved openly contesting versions." One version, "founded long memory persecution, genocide, bitter struggle survival, pessimistic, distrustful non-Jews, believing Jewish power solidarity." Another, "nourished secularized Versions messianism well Enlightenment idea progress," articulates "a deep sense limits military force, commitment liberal-democratic values." Every country manifests kind ideological divide. But contemporary Israel, gulf among widest earth. As Ezrahi others noted, latter, liberal-democratic Zionism grown alongside new individualism, particularly among secular Israelis, greater demand free expression, greater skepticism coercive authority. You see spirit "new historians" like Tom Segev fearlessly excavated darker corners Zionist past jurists like former Supreme Court President Aharon Barak overturned Knesset laws violate human rights guarantees Israel's "Basic Laws." You also see former Prime Minister Ehud Barak's apparent willingness relinquish much West Bank 2000 early 2001. But Israel today, humane, universalistic Zionism wield power. To contrary, gasping air. To understand deeply antithetical values Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, it's worth considering case Effi Eitam. Eitam, charismatic ex–cabinet minister war hero, proposed ethnically cleansing Palestinians West Bank. "We'll expel overwhelming majority West Bank Arabs remove Israeli Arabs [the] political system," declared 2006. In 2008, Eitam merged small Ahi Party Netanyahu's Likud. And 2009-2010 academic year, Netanyahu's special emissary overseas "campus engagement." In capacity, visited dozen American high schools colleges last fall Israeli government's behalf. The group organized tour called "Caravan Democracy." Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman shared Eitam's views. In youth, briefly joined Meir Kahane's banned Kach Party, also advocated expulsion Arabs Israeli soil. Now Lieberman's position might called "pre-expulsion." He wants revoke citizenship Israeli Arabs won't swear loyalty oath Jewish state. He tried prevent two Arab parties opposed Israel's 2008-2009 Gaza war running candidates Knesset. He said Arab Knesset members met representatives Hamas executed. He wants jail Arabs publicly mourn Israeli Independence Day, hopes permanently deny citizenship Arabs countries marry Arab citizens Israel. You don't paranoid see connection Lieberman's current views former ones. The strip Israeli Arabs legal protection, accuse treason, thinkable policy expulsion becomes. Lieberman's American defenders often note theory supports Palestinian state. What usually fail mention him, two-state solution means redrawing Israel's border large chunk Israeli Arabs find exiled another country, without consent. Lieberman served chief staff Netanyahu's first term prime minister. And comes West Bank, Netanyahu's record way even extreme protégé's. In 1993 book, A Place among Nations, Netanyahu rejects idea Palestinian state, denies thing Palestinian. In fact, repeatedly equates Palestinian bid statehood Nazism. An Israel withdraws West Bank, declared, would "ghetto-state" "Auschwitz borders." And effort "to gouge Judea Samaria [the West Bank] Israel" resembles Hitler's bid wrench German-speaking "Sudeten district" Czechoslovakia 1938. It unfair, Netanyahu insists, ask Israel concede territory since already made vast, gut-wrenching concessions. What kind concessions? It abandoned claim Jordan, rights part Jewish state. On left Netanyahu's coalition sits Ehud Barak's emasculated Labor Party, whatever moderating potential may counterbalanced is, ways, illiberal coalition partner all, Shas, ultra-Orthodox party representing Jews North African Middle Eastern descent. At one point, Shas—like Ashkenazi ultra- Orthodox counterparts—was open dismantling settlements. In recent years, however, ultra-Orthodox Israelis, anxious find housing large families, increasingly moved West Bank, thanks government subsidies far cheaper live. Not coincidentally, political parties swung hard territorial compromise. And done virulence reflects ultra-Orthodox Judaism's profound hostility liberal values. Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Shas's immensely powerful spiritual leader, called Arabs "vipers," "snakes," "ants." In 2005, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon proposed dismantling settlements Gaza Strip, Yosef urged "God strike down." The official Shas newspaper recently called President Obama "an Islamic extremist." Hebrew University Professor Ze'ev Sternhell expert fascism winner prestigious Israel Prize. Commenting Lieberman leaders Shas recent Op-Ed Haaretz, wrote, "The last time politicians holding views similar power post–World War II Western Europe Franco's Spain." With blessing, "a crude multifaceted campaign waged foundations democratic liberal order." Sternhell know. In September 2008, injured settler set pipe bomb house. Israeli governments come go, Netanyahu coalition product frightening, long-term trends Israeli society: ultra-Orthodox population increasing dramatically, settler movement growing radical entrenched Israeli bureaucracy army, Russian immigrant community particularly prone anti-Arab racism. In 2009, poll Israel Democracy Institute found 53 percent Jewish Israelis (and 77 percent recent immigrants former USSR) support encouraging Arabs leave country. Attitudes worst among Israel's young. When Israeli high schools held mock elections last year, Lieberman won. This March, poll found 56 percent Jewish Israeli high school students—and 80 percent religious Jewish high school students— would deny Israeli Arabs right elected Knesset. An education ministry official called survey "a huge warning signal light strengthening trends extremist views among youth." You might think trends, sympathy expressed Israel's government, would occasion substantial public concern—even outrage—among leaders organized American Jewry. You would wrong. In Israel itself, voices left, even center, warn increasingly urgent tones threats Israeli democracy. (Former Prime Ministers Ehud Olmert Ehud Barak said Israel risks becoming "apartheid state" continues hold West Bank. This April, settlers forced large Israeli bookstore stop selling book critical occupation, Shulamit Aloni, former head dovish Meretz Party, declared "Israel democratic time now.") But United States, groups like AIPAC Presidents' Conference patrol public discourse, scolding people contradict vision Israel state leaders cherish democracy yearn peace. The result terrible irony. In theory, mainstream American Jewish organizations still hew liberal vision Zionism. On website, AIPAC celebrates Israel's commitment "free speech minority rights." The Conference Presidents declares "Israel United States share political, moral intellectual values including democracy, freedom, security peace." These groups would never say, Netanyahu's coalition, Israeli Arabs don't deserve full citizenship West Bank Palestinians don't deserve human rights. But practice, defending virtually anything Israeli government does, make intellectual bodyguards Israeli leaders threaten liberal values profess admire. After Israel's elections last February, instance, Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice-chairman Presidents' Conference, explained Avigdor Lieberman's agenda "far moderate media presented it." Insisting Lieberman bears general animus toward Israeli Arabs, Abraham Foxman, national director Anti- Defamation League, told Jewish Telegraphic Agency "He's saying expel them. He's saying punish them." (Permanently denying citizenship Arab spouses jailing publicly mourn Israeli Independence Day evidently qualify punishment.) The ADL criticized anti-Arab bigotry past, American Jewish Committee, credit, warned Lieberman's proposed loyalty oath would "chill Israel's democratic political debate." But Forward summed overall response America's communal Jewish leadership headline "Jewish Leaders Largely Silent Lieberman's Role Government." Not organized American Jewish community mostly avoid public criticism Israeli government, tries prevent others leveling criticism well. In recent years, American Jewish organizations waged campaign discredit world's respected international human rights groups. In 2006, Foxman called Amnesty International report Israeli killing Lebanese civilians "bigoted, biased, borderline anti-Semitic." The Conference Presidents announced "biased NGOs include Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Christian Aid, [and] Save Children." Last summer, AIPAC spokesman declared Human Rights Watch "has repeatedly demonstrated anti-Israel bias." When Obama administration awarded Presidential Medal Freedom Mary Robinson, former UN high commissioner human rights, ADL AIPAC protested, citing fact presided 2001 World Conference Against Racism Durban, South Africa. (Early drafts conference report implicitly accused Israel racism. Robinson helped expunge defamatory charge, angering Syria Iran.) Human Rights Watch Amnesty International infallible. But groups like AIPAC Presidents' Conference avoid virtually public criticism Israeli actions—directing outrage solely Israel's neighbors—they leave poor position charge bias. Moreover, American Jewish groups claim simply defending Israel foes, actually taking sides struggle within Israel radically different Zionist visions. At moment Anti-Defamation League claimed Robinson harbored "animus toward Israel," alliance seven Israeli human rights groups publicly congratulated award. Many groups, like B'Tselem, monitors Israeli actions Occupied Territories, Israeli branch Physicians Human Rights, least critical Israel's actions Lebanon, Gaza, West Bank Amnesty International Human Rights Watch. All raises uncomfortable question. If American Jewish groups claim Israel's overseas human rights critics motivated anti- Israeli, anti-Semitic, bias, say Israel's domestic human rights critics? The implication clear: must guilty self-hatred, treason. American Jewish leaders don't generally say that, course, allies Netanyahu government do. Last summer, Israel's vice prime minister, Moshe Ya'alon, called anti-occupation group Peace Now "virus." This January, right-wing group called Im Tirtzu accused Israeli human rights organizations fed information Goldstone Commission investigated Israel's Gaza war. A Knesset member Netanyahu's Likud promptly charged Naomi Chazan, head New Israel Fund, supports human rights groups, treason, member Lieberman's party launched investigation aimed curbing foreign funding Israeli NG0s. To credit, Foxman American Jewish leaders opposed move, might impaired work. But reaping sowed. If suggest mainstream human rights criticism Israel's government motivated animus toward state, toward Jews general, give aid comfort Israel make charges human rights critics midst. In American Jewish establishment today, language liberal Zionism—with idioms human rights, equal citizenship, territorial compromise—has drained meaning. It remains lingua franca part generational reasons, many older American Zionists still see liberals sort. They vote Democratic; unmoved biblical claims West Bank; see average Palestinians decent people betrayed bad leaders; secular. They don't want Jewish organizations criticize Israel left, neither want agents Israeli right. These American Zionists largely product particular era. Many shaped terrifying days leading Six-Day War, appeared Israel might overrun, bitter aftermath Yom Kippur War, much world seemed turn Jewish state. In crucible, Israel became Jewish identity, often conjunction Holocaust, 1967 1973 wars helped make central American Jewish life. These Jews embraced Zionism settler movement became major force Israeli politics, 1982 Lebanon war, first intifada. They fell love Israel secular, less divided, less shaped culture, politics, theology occupation. And downplaying significance Avigdor Lieberman, settlers, Shas, American Jewish groups allow older Zionists continue identify internally cohesive, innocent Israel youth, Israel exists memories. But secular Zionists aren't reproducing themselves. Their children memory Arab armies massed Israel's border Israel surviving part thanks urgent military assistance United States. Instead, grown viewing Israel regional hegemon occupying power. As result, conscious parents degree Israeli behavior violates liberal ideals, less willing grant Israel exemption survival seems peril. Because inherited parents' liberalism, cannot embrace uncritical Zionism. Because liberalism real, see liberalism American Jewish establishment fake. To sustain uncritical brand Zionism, therefore, America's Jewish organizations need look elsewhere replenish ranks. They need find young American. Jews come age West Bank occupation troubled it. And young American Jews come disproportionately Orthodox world. Because marry earlier, intermarry less, children, Orthodox Jews growing rapidly share American Jewish population. According 2006 American Jewish Committee (AJC) survey, Orthodox Jews make 12 percent American Jewry age sixty, constitute 34 percent ages eighteen twenty-four. For America's Zionist organizations, Orthodox youngsters potential bonanza. In yeshivas learn devotion Israel early age; generally spend year religious study high school, often know friends relatives immigrated Israel. The AJC study found 16 percent non-Orthodox adult Jews age forty feel "very close Israel," among Orthodox figure 79 percent. As secular Jews drift away America's Zionist institutions, Orthodox counterparts likely step breach. The Orthodox "are still interested parochial Jewish concerns," explains Samuel Heilman, sociologist City University New York. "They among last ones stayed Jewish house, control lights." But parochialism—a deep commitment Jewish concerns, often outweighs universal ones— gives Orthodox Jewish Zionism distinctly illiberal cast. The 2006 AJC poll found 60 percent non- Orthodox American Jews age forty support Palestinian state, figure drops 25 percent among Orthodox. In 2009, Brandeis University's Theodore Sasson asked American Jewish focus groups Israel, found Orthodox participants much less supportive dismantling settlements part peace deal. Even tellingly, Reform, Conservative, unaffiliated Jews tended believe average Palestinians wanted peace, ill- served leaders. Orthodox Jews, contrast, likely see Palestinian people enemy, deny ordinary Palestinians shared common interests values ordinary Israelis Jews. Orthodox Judaism great virtues, including communal warmth commitment Jewish learning unmatched American Jewish world. (I'm biased, since family attends Orthodox synagogue.) But current trends continue, growing influence Orthodox Jews America's Jewish communal institutions erode even liberal-democratic veneer today covers American Zionism. In 2002, America's major Jewish organizations sponsored large Israel solidarity rally Washington Mall. Up east coast, yeshivas shut day, swelling estimated Orthodox share crowd close 70 percent. When Deputy Secretary Defense Paul Wolfowitz told rally "innocent Palestinians suffering dying well," booed. America's Jewish leaders think hard rally. Unless change course, portends future: American Zionist movement even feign concern Palestinian dignity broader American Jewish population even feign concern Israel. My children, given upbringing, could easily end among booers among Luntz's focus group. Either prospect fills dread. In 2004, effort prevent weapons smuggling Egypt, Israeli tanks bulldozers demolished hundreds houses Rafah refugee camp southern Gaza Strip. Watching television, veteran Israeli commentator politician named Tommy Lapid saw elderly Palestinian woman crouched fours looking medicines amid ruins home. He said reminded grandmother. In moment, Lapid captured spirit suffocating within organized American Jewish life. To begin with, watched. In experience, epidemic watching among American Zionists today. A Red Cross study malnutrition Gaza Strip, bill Knesset allow Jewish neighborhoods bar entry Israeli Arabs, Israeli human rights report settlers burning Palestinian olive groves, three Palestinian teenagers shot—it's unpleasant. Rationalizing minimizing Palestinian suffering become kind game. In recent report foster Zionism among America's young, Luntz urges American Jewish groups use word "Arabs, Palestinians," since "the term `Palestinians' evokes images refugee camps, victims oppression," "Arab' says wealth, oil Islam." Of course, Israel—like United States—must sometimes take morally difficult actions defense. But morally difficult allow human connection side. Otherwise, security justifies everything. The heads AIPAC Presidents' Conference ask Israel's leaders would say make scream "no." After all, Lieberman foreign minister; Effi Eitam touring American universities; settlements growing triple rate Israeli population; half Israeli Jewish high school students want Arabs barred Knesset. If line yet crossed, line? What infuriated critics Lapid's comment grandmother died Auschwitz. How dare defile memory Holocaust? Of course, Holocaust immeasurably worse anything Israel done ever do. • But least Lapid used Jewish suffering connect suffering others. In world AIPAC, Holocaust analogies never stop, message always same: Jews licensed victimhood worry themselves. Many Israel's founders believed statehood, Jews would rightly judged way treated non-Jews living dominion. "For first time shall majority living minority," Knesset member Pinchas Lavon declared 1948, "and shall called upon provide example prove Jews live minority." But message American Jewish establishment allies Netanyahu government exactly opposite: since Jews history's permanent victims, always knife-edge extinction, moral responsibility luxury Israel have. Its responsibility survive. As former Knesset speaker Avraham Burg writes remarkable 2008 book, The Holocaust Is Over; We Must Rise From Its Ashes, "Victimhood sets free." This obsession victimhood lies heart Zionism dying among America's secular Jewish young. It simply bears relationship lived experience, seen Israel's. Yes, Israel faces threats Hezbollah Hamas. Yes, Israelis understandably worry nuclear Iran. But dilemmas face possess dozens hundreds nuclear weapons, adversary, however despicable, may acquire one, dilemmas Warsaw Ghetto. The year 2010 not, Benjamin Netanyahu claimed, 1938. The drama Jewish victimhood—a drama feels natural many Jews lived 1938, 1948, even 1967—strikes today's young American Jews farce. But different Zionist calling, never desperately relevant. It roots Israel's Independence Proclamation, promised Jewish state "will based precepts liberty, justice peace taught Hebrew prophets," December 1948 letter Albert Einstein, Hannah Arendt, others The New York Times, protesting right-wing Zionist leader Menachem Begin's visit United States party's militias massacred Arab civilians village Deir Yassin. It call recognize world Jewish fortunes radically changed, best way memorialize history Jewish suffering ethical use Jewish power. For several months now, group Israeli students traveling every Friday East Jerusalem neighborhood Sheikh Jarrah, Palestinian family named Ghawis lives street outside home fifty-three years, evicted make room Jewish settlers. Although repeatedly arrested protesting without permit, called traitors self-haters Israeli right, students keep coming, numbers swelling thousands. What American Jewish organizations brought young people speak Hillel? What face Zionism shown America's Jewish young? What students Luntz's focus group told generation faces challenge momentous Jewish history: save liberal democracy Jewish state earth? "Too many years I lived warm embrace institutionalized elusiveness part it," writes Avraham Burg. "I comfortable there." I know; I comfortable too. But comfortable Zionism become moral abdication. Let's hope Luntz's students, solidarity counterparts Sheikh Jarrah, foster uncomfortable Zionism, Zionism angry Israel risks becoming, love still could be. Let's hope care enough try. —May 12, 2010 .
