This distilled, pure utterly conventional wisdom much DC political chattering class moment. The first two paragraphs important, completely accurate assessment, rest twaddle: 1:1 Monday, Oct. 11,2010 Why Obama Is Losing Political War By Mark Halperin Barack Obama politically crushed vise. From above, elite opinion competence. From below, mass anger anxiety unemployment. And late anything predicament November's elections. With exception core Obama Administration loyalists, politically engaged elites reached conclusions: White House head, isolated, insular, arrogant clueless get along persuade members Congress, media, business community working-class voters. This view held Fox News pundits, executives anchors major old-media outlets, reporters cover White House, Democratic Republican congressional leaders governors, many Democratic business people lawyers raised big money Obama 2008, even members Administration beyond inner circle. (See Obama's troubled first year, issue issue.) On Friday, release latest bleak unemployment data — last major jobs figures midterms — Obama said, "Putting American people back work, expanding opportunity, rebuilding economic security middle class moral national challenge time." But elites feel President failed meet challenge convinced unable remainder term. Moreover, growing perception Obama's decisions causing harm — businesses hurt Administration's legislation economic recovery stalling uncertainty surrounding energy policy, health care, deficits, housing, immigration spending. And sentiment spreading. Many members general public appear deeply skeptical Obama's capacity turn things around, especially, exclusively, inclined dislike — Tea Partyers John McCain voters, also tens millions middle-class Americans, including quite turned Obama 2008. (See Americans facing prospect long-term unemployment.) The misery afflicting country political affiliation. Listen voices striking TV ad Rob Portman, Republican former Congressman Bush budget director running Senate Ohio. One woman Dayton career fair says starkly, "There jobs." A man announces plaintively obvious frustration, "I've looking job 13 months." Events like job fair becoming grim iconic gatherings time, breadlines Obama years. Most Obama's private (and sometimes public) rebuttals voices slamming sides justified spot on. He inherit lot problems Bush Administration. He act quickly initial weeks Administration stave worldwide depression. His efforts job creation obstructed Republicans (even proposals based policies supported GOP past). His opponents haven't put forth specifics own, offered genuine compromise, media allowed right's activists gabbers run wild criticism without furnishing legitimate alternative solutions. (See Barack Obama's top 10 sound bites.) But Obama exacerbated political problems failing enact policies would actually turned economy around, also authorizing series tactical moves intended demonize Republicans distract problems hand. He wasted time lambasting foes putting forth agenda clear, optimistic fashion, defending benefits key decisions past two years (health care Troubled Asset Relief Program, example) explaining would re-elected Democratic majority spur growth. Throughout year, treated Obama-led attacks George W. Bush Dick Cheney, Rush Limbaugh, Congressman Joe Barton (for odd apology BP), John Boehner (for seeking speakership — something ant?) Fox News (for everything). Suitable Democratic targets cases, perhaps, worth time busy Commander Chief. In past days, witnessed spectacle President top advisers wading allegations Republicans attempting buy election using foreign money laundered Chamber Commerce, combining Karl Rove wealthy backers fund flood negative television commercials. Not issue convoluted far-fetched, also distracts issues voters care about, frustrating political insiders alienating struggling citizens (not many following offbeat story line). Feinting gibing can't obscure job numbers. (See best viral campaign ads 2010.) The President Democrats passed many significant measures (the stimulus spending, auto-company rescue, health care law financial regulation effort) someday may seen brave bold, foundation better economy. Obama closest aides certainly think happen. But President correct said Friday, "the piece economic news folks still looking work want hear is, 'You're hired," that's still occurring many Americans. The politically good news Obama matter outcome midterm elections, everything changes January. Republicans greater obligation, politically morally, help govern, rather thwart badger. The President get chance, State Union address budget proposal, show turning page political horrors 2010 party nation. But then, Republicans almost certainly going demonstrate beat something nothing, especially Americans seem think Obama Administration hasn't much offer either, except isn't working. • Find article at: • http://www.time.com/time/golitics/article/0,8599,2024718,00.html Copyright © 2010 Time Inc.
