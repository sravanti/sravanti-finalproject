The Middle East peace process long ago turned tortured charade pure process events ground — particular relentless strategic Israeli colonisation occupied Palestinian land — pull opposite direction peace. "We colluding gigantic confidence trick," one Arab minister puts it, "and go again." While many factors combined hand veto powers rejectionists sides, heart question remains continuing Israeli occupation. It essential remember biggest single increase Jewish settlers Arab — 50 per cent rise — took place 1992-96 governments peace-makers Yitzhak Rabin Shimon Peres at.the high-water mark Oslo peace accords. Many Israelis point perfidy late Yassir Arafat, wanted talk peace keep option armed resistance dangerously play. But killed Oslo occupation. The second intifada erupted decade ago essentially Oslo war. A decade on, Israeli settlement enterprise turned occupied West Bank discontiguous scattering cantons, walled security barrier built yet annexed Arab land criss-crossed segregated Israeli roads linking settlements. Last month, B'Tselem, Israeli human rights group, published study showing Israel taken 42 per cent West Bank, 300,000 settlers another 200,000 East Jerusalem. The siege Gaza turned sliver land vast, open-air prison. The main feature present situationi disconnect high politics utterly discredited peace process — Israeli parlance — "facts ground". At last month's White House summit, Barack Obama Benjamin Netanyahu massaged long estrangement political armistice, US president praised Israeli prime minister leader "willing take risks peace". But evidence whatsoever. True, June last year, response Mr Obama's Cairo speech denying legitimacy Israel's settlements, Mr Netanyahu forced utter words "Palestinian state" — surrounded barbed-wire caveats voided meaning. Indeed, words sides use — peace, resolution, security, — may same; side means different. The mainstream Palestinian leaders, President Mahmoud Abbas Salem Fayyad, prime minister, Quartet made US, European Union, UN Russia, talk negotiated resolution. This means two states living peace security, Palestinian homeland 22 per cent Mandate Palestine taken Israel 1967 Arab-Israeli war. East Jerusalem would serve capital West Bank Gaza, marginal land swaps preserve Israeli settlements near Jerusalem. But Mr Netanyahu mean? He clear mean. For start, set face concessions Jerusalem. He wants keep settlements except far-flung "ideological" ones 100-plus "outposts" established pawns traded chess game began. His idea demilitarised Palestinian state like sort supra-municipal administration self-determined, independent government. Will surprise us, hackneyed Nixon China principle holds politicians right easily close difficult deals? There little suggest that: The thinking Mr Netanyahu, son celebrated promoter Greater Israel, always profoundly irredentist. While nationalist Likud faces constraints coalition assortment ultra-rightist ultra-orthodox parties well Labour, plainly choice; centrist Kadima party (and remains) alternative. To fair, Israel's electoral system — low threshold entry Knesset makes multi-party coalitions inevitable — means lobbies settlers take national interest hostage. But Mr Netanyahu magnifies choice partners diligently firing ultra-hawks pro-Israel lobby US. As risks he. taken peace, Exhibit A much-hyped moratorium settlement-building, expires next month has, case, speciously interpreted. While bulldozers build settlements idling, moreover, bulldozers demolishing Palestinian homes roaring: rate demolition around Jerusalem doubled year, army razed village al-Farisiye Jordan Valley, line Mr Netanyahu's strategically obsolete obsession keeping valley Israel's eastern border. As diplomacy struggles keep alive viability two-state solution, three rival systems control crystallised occupied territories would make future Palestinian homeland: settlements; crimped Palestinian Authority Mr Abbas Mr Fayyad; Hamas, Israel Arab western allies tried failed marginalise. Time short negotiated outcome; may even run out. The outlines deal clear, (Bill) Clinton parameters 2000 Arab Peace initiative 2002, endorsed 22 Arab 57 Muslim countries (as well Hamas, part 2007 Mecca accord). There end occupation, US Quartet cannot allude this; must demand it. The writer international affairs editor "FT" "Financial Times" trademarks Financial Times.
