Faced government incompetence corruption, people rebelling. By Max Blumenthal Dec 4, 2002 I The body another murdered woman found late last month Mexican industrial hub Ciudad Juarez, dumped behind shrubs squalor Anapra neighborhood, ramshackle hodgepodge corrugated tin cardboard shacks sludge-washed banks Rio Grande. Her hands tied, evidence suggested raped. The body badly decomposed investigators calculated she'd dead seven months. However horrific details, numbing familiarity. The body woman died similar circumstances found dusty lot couple months earlier. The bodies eight women found lot far away little year ago. So many women murdered past 10 years reliable count. Most experts place close 325, average 32 year, nearly three every month. At least 90 deaths believed work one serial killers. Hundreds women simply vanished. Like many others, woman whose body found late October probably come Juarez poverty southern Mexico work $10 day one many foreign-owned assembly plants known maquiladoras sprouted Juarez North American Free Trade Agreement signed 1994. And like them, too, body unclaimed death buried alone anonymous. Such death become way life here. So, too, fear paranoia rise climate. Nobody knows killings, mystery seems deepen. Arrests made local authorities produced allegations torture, witness tampering frame-ups -- convictions. Most believe killer killers must enormous clout. Perhaps, say, killers narcotrafficantes disposing witnesses. Perhaps sons wealthy powerful indulging sick sex. Perhaps cultists whose members come highest levels government finance. The theories differ, common assumption arrests made thus far smokescreen historically opaque corrupt government protect dark secrets cost. One thing seems clear: The murders arise social landscape transformed global economic forces. Where Ciudad Juarez small, sleepy desert outpost across border El Paso, Texas, population past decade exploded 1.2 million people, many drawn lure maquiladoras. The tides people overwhelmed ability city absorb them, overwhelmed health services, social services law enforcement. Free-trade advocates promised NAFTA would transform Juarez City Future -- proven right way never could imagined. Today, Juarez still feel lawless Old West, grim 21st century edge. Despite promises swift justice Mexican President Vicente Fox Chihuahua Gov. Patricio Martinez, yet take offers assistance FBI; bureau agents Texas suggested official corruption hindering efforts stop murders. Chihuahua state investigators seemingly adopted "don't ask, don't tell" policy towards Juarez's homicides, fostering atmosphere impunity pervasive fear. Foreign corporations operating Juarez employed many murdered women largely deny atmosphere exists. But postmodern urban culture, concept community broken down, many bereaved family members local activists begun take matters hands, investigating murders speaking even means threats reprisals. Evangeline Arce's daughter, Silvia, street vendor, disappeared Nov. 3, 1998. Since day, said, authorities done little investigate. "Two days daughter disappeared, I went police filed report," mother says Spanish, face flaring anger. "They promised prompt action I checked back week later, Missing persons report never filed investigation even begun. When finally got witnesses together, none would talk afraid." Even Mexico continues make strides toward becoming open democratic society, epidemic rape murder exposed heavy residue corrupt authoritarian political legacy well contradictions efforts economic expansion. To understand magnitude breakdown, think sniper rampage Washington area fall left 10 people dead three wounded. Imagine Montgomery County Police Chief Charles Moose held press conference asked local citizens catch sniper local police task federal government helpful; imagine federal government charged local officials Montgomery County complicit killings impeding investigation. Chaos would ensue, certainly. But then, multiply. number victims 30, 40, 50, more. That's Juarez today. The jumbled, exhaust-choked commercial core city grown wildly wake NAFTA, adding modern shopping malls, condominiums expansive boulevards. The population growing twice rate national average; expected nearly double 2010, 2 million people. Many directly indirectly rely 300 maquiladoras livelihoods. To accommodate new army workers, city given birth entirely new sectors. The Campestre Juarez luxurious conglomerate gated communities, main gate that's life-size replica Paris' Arc de Triomphe. Nearby, many maquiladoras situated along Avenida de la Industria. Though assembly-line workers sometimes glimpsed behind plate glass window aqua-blue uniforms, usually little sign activity behind maquiladoras' featureless walls. Most new residents poor, brink poverty, live Anapra another grim, violent colonias populares outskirts town. In colonies, residents usually live without sanitation, running water, electricity paved roads. Avenida Manuel Gomez Morin pothole-riddled six-lane avenue ties varied worlds together. Sitio Colosio Valle, medium-sized strip mall, stands corner avenue gateway industrial sector. It fronted vast parking lot inside various clothing outlets boutiques. By day, lot bustles customers scurry back forth, hauling purchases cars -- sight similar mall suburban United States. By night, however, traffic tapers off, stores lock mall's lot becomes dark desolate. Sitio Colosio Valle many slain missing women last seen. In mall's parking lot, Braulio Rosas, 40-year-old security guard, leans door giant Nike outlet. Inside store, bright fluorescent lights, employees frantically check inventory scramble close up. "A lot girls picked here," Roses says voice calm resignation. "But really, it's girls' fault. It's even though weren't putas, [prostitutes] know, like fad/es [easy women]. They didn't get cars didn't want to." Rosas sounds cynical, blaming victims means aberration Juarez. Similar notions offered officials like Suly Ponce, former Chihuahua special prosecutor charge murdered women's cases. "Sometimes cases girl meets person, strikes relationship her, drink ... ends violently," told Washington Post 2000, promoted job governor's office. "It's difficult know." A handful women found murdered since 1993 indeed confirmed prostitutes. But truth large majority missing murdered women hardworking, young, poor part socially conservative. Most migrated Juarez Mexico's depressed south work maquiladoras, sometimes arriving alone little means contacting families back home. The maquiladoras, run companies like Delphi RCA Thomson, prefer hire young women assembly-line jobs. An entry-level assembly-line worker makes minimum wage, $2 hour. With experience, pay rise much $2,50 hour -- compared wages Guerrero Chiapas, that's good money. But Juarez, women caught economic trap: Since cost living slighter lower El Paso, wages seem high new maquiladora workers actually ensure poverty. The workers hired fired spot, little pretext legal protection. And union activities prohibited. Even accept conditions, security elusive. More often now, global companies maquiladoras closing shop transferring operations China take advantage lower taxes, investment subsidies outrageously cheap labor. On June 29, Royal Philips Electronics announced moving P.C. monitor manufacturing operations, cost 900 jobs. On July 1, Scientific Atlanta fired 1,300 workers shutting plant down. According Nov. 5 New York Times, trend cost Juarez 287,000 jobs maquiladoras since peak October 2000. Not slash burn economic base. There brutal social reverberations, too. The city's health system, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, reported 200,000 people falling list insured losing company policies, according July article La Prensa. Esther Chavez Cano, director Juarez's battered- women's shelter, Casa Amiga, said speech summer domestic violence cases risen 50 percent July alone. The combination poverty lack social connections renders women assembly line powerless virtually invisible. And made easy prey. According El Paso Times, third approximately 325 slain women employed maquiladoras time murder. Given maquiladoras provide shuttle service colonies, female workers often preyed upon walking perilous places like Sitio Colosio Valle darkness early morning. At hour, nearby activity bars nightclubs closing male patrons filter street long night drinking. Besides China's attractive economic climate, intangible cause maquiladora flight Juarez's chronic violence. The effect difficult measure. Two companies city's industrial sector -- including TDK, audio tape maker -- posted banners factories reading: "STOP THE VIOLENCE. To Better Our City, Let's Unite." But foreign companies purely economic organisms governed entirely, seems, dictates efficiency. They maintained stunning silence even female workers slaughtered. Consider case 17-year-old Claudia !vette Gonzalez. Her body found November 2001 along seven others overgrown cotton field Avenida Technologico, blocks Sitio Colosio Valle mall across street offices Association Maquiladoras. She worked assembly line Lear Corp., Detroit-based auto-interior supplier. Lear declined publicly address Gonzalez's murder. Greg Bloom, editor Frontera Norte Sur -- Internet news service focuses U.S.-Mexico border -- recalled conversation Gonzalez's mother, Josefina, recounted daughter's last day. In darkness early morning, Gonzalez told him, Claudia set job Lear. When arrived work minutes late missing bus, Claudia lvette promptly sent away policy barring tardy assembly-line workers shifts. A half-hour past usually would returned home, mother knew something gravely wrong. Her worst fear -- nagging fear shared many Juarez mothers -- would soon realized. Andrea Puchalsky, Lear's director communications, acknowledged company made public statements regarding Gonzalez's murder, enacted proactive measures protect employees another wave violence. "Adding security question relates Lear," said. "[Gonzalez's murder] happen Lear property." When questioned murder Lear policies, Puchalsky mentioned company memo prepared responses possible questions. As Lear's worker-lockout policy, apparently put Gonzalez precarious situation day abduction, Puchalsky declined comment whether Gonzalez locked sent home Lear's plant last day. "We policy tardiness tardy many times," Puchalsky said. "When arrived late work shift, time work shift." When asked whether Lear's offices U.S. similar policy late employees barred working shifts, Puchalsky reversed earlier statement, vehemently denying policy existed anywhere within Lear's operations. "There policy send worker home X number tardy arrivals," said. "Typically someone arriving late kind warning system, might notification 'the next time arrive late, take day ...' It's policy, though. There written policy like throughout Lear Corp." The body 17-year-old Lilia Alejandra Garcia found mutilated 300 feet maquiladora February 2001, since case come embody incompetence corruption police prosecutors Ciudad Juarez state capital Chihuahua City south way Mexico City. Garcia, mother 5-month-old baby 2-year-old child, apparently kidnapped left work. She held captivity week, repeatedly beaten raped, strangled. Then-prosecutor Suly Ponce told Juarez newspaper El Diario Garcia first woman year murdered raped area city - - even though two days before, body unidentified woman found naked blocks away. When FBI leak revealed witness testimony linking Lilia Garcia's killers drug dealers, Suly Ponce dismissed it, calling erroneous. She instead blamed workers circus across street strip mall Garcia last seen. When circus managers claimed Ponce offered money blame co-workers, dropped investigation. According July article El Paso Times, former Chihuahua state forensic chief Oscar Maynez Grijalva said Garcia killed similar manner three eight women found cotton field Claudia 'vette Gonzalez November 2001. Curiously, local authorities behaved evasively investigation Garcia's. When Gonzalez seven women's bodies found November 2001, ex-Chihuahua Attorney General Arturo Gonzalez Rascon immediately fingered two local bus drivers culprits. Yet doubts guilt arose, especially Grijalva -- Rascon's evidence expert time -- resigned post, citing pressure fabricate evidence them. And head local prison forced office documented signs torture accused men returned Rascon's office. Four months later, February 2002, search-and-rescue team combing cotton field found Claudia lvette Gonzalez's overalls plastic bag, along strands hair crucial pieces evidence Rascon's investigators failed discover. In response, Rascon offered opinion El Paso Times: "The state police done thoroughly professional job. I doubt that." But Oct. 28, DNA results revealed Rascon's investigators properly identified one eight dead women -- Gonzalez. Stuck far dubious task catching one madman replacing one feeble leader, Juarez's fractured civil society paralyzed. A cynical mood palpable speaking citizens street, unanimously express fear distrust law-enforcement government officials. Some local cops cynical. "We can't sit around deserted places waiting someone drive dump bodies off," said one municipal police officer seated idling paddy wagon refused give name security reasons. "There us city's big ... We don't get much support federal government. Judicially, protected like cops U.S. Plus, arms give us weak bulletproof vests don't really stop bullets. It's that, though. I young woman home I put place parents lost daughters. But it's question society. We need support need conscious going get better here." The scope crime enormous, little success stopping it, suspicion breeds itself. The litany theories killers motive might suggests Juarez become breeding ground every imaginable predator. And yet, nobody knows. Nothing certain. And feeds climate paranoia. Garcia Gonzalez's murders rumored work serial killer possible ties drug dealers. Yet Garcia found marks wrists that, according local forensics experts, identical made police handcuffs. And upon discovery daughter's overalls, Josefina Gonzalez told El Paso Times someone powerful undoubtedly responsible murder. Many Mexico's law enforcement community agree ring rich men behind killings, evidence support theory. Some suggest young men local aristocracy responsible, protected parents. A persistent theory holds murders -- significant subset -- linked powerful narcotraficantes co-opted segments local ruling class. And cynicism exacerbated fact 17 men one woman accused serial killer masterminds murders, one convicted, Abdel Latif Sharif Sharif, Egyptian chemist resident Texas time extradition Mexico 1995. Currently, Sharif awaiting sentencing allegedly paying drug trafficker named Victor Manuel Rivera Moreno carry dozen murders. However, evidence Sharif suspect charges changed repeatedly. Once even charged killing woman, Elizabeth Ontiveros, showed later police offices prove alive. In 1996, Sharif accused paying gang Los Rebeldes kill 17 women. Then, 1999, charged hiring five bus drivers El Paso man jail cell kill seven women. Officials claimed Sharif hired killers deflect blame himself. By 1999, judges cleared charges, citing absence concrete evidence possibility witness intimidation prosecutors. Suly Ponce, supervised case, yet make compelling case him. In 1999 radio interview, rather presenting hard evidence, claimed Sharif aggressively hostile toward women Egyptian background. Now says case Sharif hinges Moreno's declaration Sharif paid carry killings money earned 13 patents developed Benchmark Research Technology. But according article El Paso Times, Benchmark never paid employees patent development. In telephone interview last week Salon, Ponce said hadn't known this. Angela Paiaveras, current special prosecutor, declined discuss Sharif's case aspect investigations. Many local residents scoff notion killers caught. "We don't believe guys arrested killers," says Miguel Angel Jaramillo, mid-level manager Lear Corp. "It's obvious they're scapegoats." Yet Ponce remains ardent belief Sharif center murders. "Today killings continue many imitators," told Salon last week. "But Sharif caught, almost homicides year." But according Juarez daily El Diario, year immediately Sharif jailed -- period spanning October 1995 October 1996 -- 28 young women found murdered. Meanwhile, theories flourish become paranoid, reflecting breakdown public trust. By one popular theory, women murdered blood rituals cabal wealthy, powerful men. Another theory posits financial motive murder. "We're finding lot girls mutilated way," says young municipal police officer declined give name. "Someone's probably killing take organs sell lot money U.S." When asked evidence support theory, officer replied hunch. Such climate sends message killers every day: You get away anything, even crime scale. But climate breeds cynicism hopelessness among people live work here, also provoked incipient revolt. On radio show "Grueso Calibre" ("Large Caliber"), popular host Samira lzaguirre frequently aired views guests critical authorities handled murders. When Attorney General Rascon accused two bus drivers cotton field murders November 2001, lzaguirre hosted drivers' wives show. After interview, advertisements began appearing local newspapers smearing lzaguirre claims frequented strip clubs romantically involved one bus drivers. News media sides border reported receipt ad signed government officials paid it. Then, February, lzaguirre started organizing vigil announced hunger strike show Radio Canon, fired. Fearing safety, moved across border El Paso. Others, too, discovered pressing complaint forcefully brings reprisal. Marisela Ortiz, co-director Nuestras Hijas Regreso Casa (Our Daughters Back Home), legal support group victims' parents, frequent guest "Grueso Calibre." Like Izaguirre, Ortiz focused resources drawing attention government police incompetence slain women's cases. And says that, like lzaguirre, faced ever-increasing danger. In Nuestras Hijas' office central Juarez, located inside small one-story row house "For Rent" sign front, Ortiz described shadow terror stalked since began pressuring authorities. She claims threatened ex-Chihuahua District Attorney Arturo Gonzalez Rascon. "Rascon came way Juarez [from Chihuahua City] tell involve cases," tells Salon. "Then I got message phone saying: 'You daughters alive. Take care them." Rascon, earlier story Associated Press, denied allegation. Last May, Ortiz says, pursued men black pickup truck tried kidnap her. She believes attempt orchestrated Rascon's office since occurred day planned travel El Paso meeting FBI Texas state Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, D-El Paso, calling bi-national investigation murders. Victims' parents came Nuestras Hijas help finding missing daughters also say threatened. Mario Lee Lopez wife, Soledad Aguilar, lost daughter, Cecilia Covarrubias. She kidnapped 1995 along granddaughter, two months old. By granddaughter would 7, Lopez Aguilar's investigation led believe alive living custody well-connected local family. To outsider desperate story, impossible prove. Lopez accuses Ponce coordinating coverup kidnappings murder: again, Ponce denies charge. And adamant government officials harassed one. "I didn't knowledge threats anybody," said. "On contrary, support families encouraged intimately involved investigations." Lopez recalls incident gone Juarez's judicial building press granddaughter's case exactly find kind support Ponce mentioned. While leaving court, Lopez says, confronted high- ranking minister warned didn't drop investigation, would tortured electric shock devices. "But it's late stop now," Lopez adds wistful smile. Despite campaign lzaguirre, perhaps it, vigil took place scheduled March. It unprecedented show solidarity, thousands people gathered cotton field Gonzalez seven others found irrigation ditch. There still tatters yellow police tape there, candleholders left vigil strewn site. Eight red crosses mark spot bodies found. However, city officials plans memorialize site Juarez's residents have. In fact, according Sept. 4 article El Diario, site used dumping ground Juarez's Department Parks Gardens. Near downtown Juarez monument Abraham Lincoln, honoring "establishing North American industries, today important world." Not far away simple gallery Collective Antigone [Antigone Collective], group local artists, organized series public performances, installations conferences focused Juarez's crisis violence. Each week, artists gather collaborate discuss strategy. At table 12 artists writers, expansive room filled cubist-inspired paintings, Antonio Munoz Ortega, 51-year-old writer, describes Collective's goals problems confronting group. "Our government authoritarian, authoritarian governments principally concerned manipulation life," says. "The victims' families feel manipulated authorities' insensitivity manifested greater greater cynicism that's really dangerous. The struggle, then, reparation simply regaining daily lives." Ortega says moved action Samira Izaguirre's candlelight vigil March. He describes building impromptu church front Association Maquiladoras office effort "communicate different language, one that's symbolic." This decision, says, helped lead formation Collective. The rallying cry Collectiva Antigona, evidenced name, Sophocles Greek tragedy, "Antigone," tells tale girl's persecution hands cruel dictator burying brother. The Collectiva organized readings play around state Chihuahua plans public performance future. The Collectiva also begun establish visual presence around central Juarez, noticeably painting wall spanning entire block poetry written participants recent writer's conference violence women. On Nov. 1 2, Mexican holiday Dia de los Muertos, collective filled room traditional altars honoring victims along giant cross center room covered masks, intended symbolize anonymity victims. An estimated 1,500 people viewed exhibit. A week later, working Nuestras Hijas, collective placed coffin flowers bonfire cotton field ditch Claudia Ivette Gonzalez seven others found. "It absolutely necessary affect civil society intention shaking indolence provoke sort reaction people," says Mariela Paniagua, 41-year-old painter. "People longer affected happening city. They lost capacity outrage face acts." While Collectiva Antigona meets, another group gathers miles away combat Juarez's violence drastically different means. Past seemingly endless rows cardboard hovels desperately poor CoIonia Morelos, beyond municipal dump, rocky desert mesa shadow Mount Indio, members search-and-rescue group called Banda Civil spread hills search murder victims. Luz Elena Guerrero Guerra, strong-looking woman late 50s intense gaze, serves president one Banda Civil's six divisions. Guerra tells began search-and-rescue group 1985 assist massive earthquake Mexico City evolved respond Juarez's crisis. She found first slain women's bodies 1989, investigators even identified deadly trend. Today, Banda Civil's members still lend help natural disasters bulk work comes search bodies, monitoring schools citywide crime- awareness campaign. Ever-present terror, coupled impotence Juarez's authorities, forced Banda Civil's transformation, Guerra says. "I've narrowly escaped violence many times," explains. "Sometimes pure luck bus taxi happens come time someone chasing ... All us, we're uncertain authorities telling us. That's indignation. If [the authorities] aren't interested helping, we'll pressure them." Because group required law cooperate police, view suspicion. Yet success activist groups failed. It Banda Civil members made crucial discovery Claudia lvette Gonzalez's overalls February, humiliating Attorney General Rascon breathing new life investigation. And Banda Civil continued find evidence weekly searches Juarez's human dumping grounds. Besides role search-and-rescue/quasi-vigilante group, Banda Civil feel support group, providing members outlet daily fear comes life Juarez. According Guerra, 300 people accompanied group searches many family members missing women. And indeed, searches family activity. On one recent Saturday, search joined 60 participants ages sectors Juarez society, including middle manager Lear Corp. There terrible discoveries day, yet afterward, people stood around talked listened norteno music blaring car stereo, evident deeply murders ingrained life -- people fighting back whatever tools hand. Perhaps quiet optimism derived age-old Mexican axiom death brings rebirth. "Instead spending time criticizing authorities, we're trying find solutions," says Santos. "We sisters daughters feel same. My daughter danger. I can't let live like this." -- By Max Blumenthal [3( Copyright Â© 2010 Salon Media Group, Inc. Reproduction material Salon pages without written permission strictly prohibited.
