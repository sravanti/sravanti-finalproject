I read Roger Cohen piece agree v smart. And I've thinking need headline/bumper sticker speech. How "A New American Century"? We cd take critics directly right front make argument way (a lot already intro, wd need pulled together differently). 1)We live new age diplomacy - seeing limits force face collective problems require bringing together wider array key players rather one nation dictating solution. Active diplomacy option. (This argument david rothkopf making mark landler thought landler profile - resonated v well w/ landler.) 2) The U.S. uniquely suited lead circumstances. a) In situations many nations must brought together trust other, still seen honest broker. b) In situations many nations sitting around table contemplating common problem, someone step forward take responsibility mobilizing action (which also includes risk failure). We nation willing that, history values. (Here S offer personal anecdotes re nations waiting us something) c) world global problems, global nation, greatest global reach, resources, connections. 3) We see global leadership responsibility also opportunity, b/c native confidence, optimism faith problems solved. We chance shape genuinely global agenda, focusing development well traditional national security issues, mobilizing business civil society well governments. This time. The speech would go on, now, outline ways building relationships solving problems traditional allies new powers global landscape building longer term architecture cooperation truly global adapted solving 21st century problems.
