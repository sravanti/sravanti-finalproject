Greetings Nairobi. I'm end week-long trip Kampala, Kinshasa Nairobi. The trip productive I fill discussions I I return. In meantime, I know number discussions Dan Benjamin others relating new aggressive approach CVE I wanted update thoughts terms critical discussions fit overall approach strategic communications around globe. As I discussed, essential become much pro-active communications efforts. To put bluntly, "information war" fronts. With proliferation media outlets opportunities around world, must fight aggressively get, maintain, fair share "consumer share mind." Both adversaries allies recognize importance aspect foreign policy adopting new ways communicating foreign publics. Consumers everywhere constantly facing barrage information cases misinformation dis-information. In order get messages across confront threats posed adversaries, must develop new sense urgency communications efforts. Much said written concept "soldier diplomats". In vein, I believe must empower corps "diplomat soldiers" help us gain ground new war. While countering violent extremism is, remain, key objective communications efforts must apply level determination respect communications. We must aggressively promote positive stories US rapidly respond attacks us. In past, failure respond attacks distortions diminished credibility undermined ability combat adversaries. For example, responded rumors innuendos surrounding relief efforts Haiti, I believe would provided fertile field AQ others continue perpetuate image US "invader". Before I left trip, I convened meeting top PD officers told must become much aggressive strategic communications programs initiatives. We plan implement daily calls new regional PD DAS's PAO's regions monitor daily basis stories USG. We work Posts ensure strategies dealing stories develop. I would also like request send cable Chiefs Mission informing new strategy reminding responsibilities critical area. We work draft review return. Finally, developing new organizational solutions, modeled approach I saw Mission Uganda, I think greatly clarify roles responsibilities respect country communications within Mission, across government agencies within particular countries.
