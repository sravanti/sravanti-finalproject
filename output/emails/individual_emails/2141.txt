Secretary Clinton, Thank you! Will update I hear her, anything else I do, let know. All best, Jackie ps Saw Foreign Minister Yeo schedule today. Fyi, one favorite Singaporeans 2007 speech China, posted blog (!): April 12, 2007 Foreign Minister George Yeo's speech dinner organised Lee Kuan Yew School Public Policy 5 February 2007, gave off-the-cuff. Thank Kishore kind words. Dear friends, ladies gentlemen. I India two weeks ago, good trip, spent nine days there. While Calcutta calling Chief Minister, I bit time look around I attended mass Mother Theresa's house. Very interesting gathering; Singapore nun there, ten years; Sister Maria Tony. I wondered someone Singapore would want dedicate life picking dead dying back alleys Calcutta living life. There many nuns ninth year. They take first vow fifth year, renewable every year. In tenth year decide - final vows eternity. So sure, please, there's way out; sure, you're room. So priest gave tough sermon talking, I could hear din traffic noise outside, streets Calcutta. Then suddenly, I heard call muezzin. Now Hindu city. I told myself, I thought wow, diversity country, India, ability internalise diversity find unremarkable tiny woman Albania come midst, become one beatified, celebrated Indian, way canonization. China India comparison- China India. China different sense itself; deep internal construction different. Superficially similarities, China US China Europe. But look it's deep construction, different. When talk China's future China 21st century, China behave world community, China's attitudes towards democracy, towards law, towards social justice. It important first look deep construction nature. Naturally deterministic, nothing inevitable human history, understand nature, becomes easier anticipate moves you'll less suprised actions. A years ago, Chinese government embarked major project dynastic duty- write history Qing dynasty, Manchus, 1368 1644. Ever since Han dynasty, roughly contemporaneous Roman Empire, developed historiographic tradition dynasty writing history previous period. So Sima Qian Later Han wrote earlier Han entire period that; later wrote Later Han, Jin wrote Three Kingdoms; Ming wrote Yuan: The Yuan, Mongol origins wrote Sung. Sung wrote Tang dynasty Classical Period. The last dynasty, Qing, collapsed Republican Revolution 1911; 2007. I think 2003, embarked project, 'The Official History Qing dynasty'. When former Vice Premier Li Lanqing Singapore recently, I asked it. He said "we told scholars rush project". I asked long would take write history. He said would take many years, easily 10 years. I said, "have collected material?" He said yes. I asked, "external sources?" He said yes, external sources too. All countries, Vatican, European countries, whole lot; assembled - 24 official histories, would 26th. And Li's instruction quick draw conclusions! Now Mao Tze Tung revolutionary, great revolutionary. He overturned everything knew history, read 24 histories, read them, annotated them. But wrote terrible, illegible scrawl, scholars decipher scrawls. Then wrote commentaries commentaries it's published. It difficult Chinese depart history it's great plains, mountains less, neighbours less seen patterns recur. So long time ago Ming dynasty wrote romantic period Three Kingdoms. The first line said: "Below heaven, great movements, great currents, long disunity leads unity long unity leads disunity." So accept part deep nature cycles civilisation; ups downs. In recent years, visit them, could sense feeling re-emergence, it's bit scary. In initial years, lacking confidence, asked many questions, know organic vitality. It like adolescent watches development, conscious it. I say scary us live periphery empire, happens radiate influence us eventually, greater lesser degree envelope us. How see China? I think begin with, it's important try and, intellectual viewpoint, transpose experiences China, I believe develop according logic, according DNA. It growing now, continue grow, develop contradictions one day contradictions, many years now, lead decline. So say beginning dynasty taxes light treasury full, end dynasty, taxes crushing treasury empty. The important thing realise China things deeply resistant change. Take Confucius. Every time overturn dynasty, overturn Confucius, Confucius justified status quo. So throughout 19th century, whether Taiping Revolution, Communist movement Sun Yat Sen; spent lives debunking Confucius. It reached final moment criticised Zhou Enlai together Confucius- no- Lin Biao together Confucius. That last paroxysm. Today, Hu Jingtao said [in Mandarin He Xie She Hui ], "harmonious society". Suddenly hear resonance Confucius coming back. And everywhere world pattern Alliance Francaise, Goethe Institute, USIA, establish Confucius Institutes learning Confucianist classics coming back remarkable force China, yet state curriculum parents wanting teach children Confucianist ditties. Now important? From Mao Deng Jiang Zemin, every stage, re-interpreted Marx. They comfortable young Marx, idea superstructure economic base, idea politics concentrated economics- like. But class struggle, downplay. They talk Three Represents, progressive forces, progressive elements, nurture those. Now Hu Jingtao says "harmonious society", "peaceful re-emergence". This mindset certain attitude towards law, certain attitude towards religion, towards democracy towards foreign policy I would like, deal turn. Joseph Needham many years ago, I think 60's, man wrote The Science Civilisation China, great encyclopedic work; said Chinese legal tradition. In fact, estimation, Chinese greater corpus legal codification West. A greater corpus legal codification West! Surprise, surprise. But idea Emperor law, completely alien thinking. Where idea come from? Well West, may trace back Hammurabi, may trace back Moses, Greece, Rome. But trace evolution DNA, goes back, way back, early beginnings. The Chinese different evolutionary starting point. It law, idea call '1i' proper conduct among human beings. They believe, deep instincts, law means towards justice, outcome law perverse, law must overridden, justice, proper conduct, proper relationship among human beings must take precedence. And suddenly say happened previous dynasties, earlier histories summarised, wrong instead adopt something origins Western Europe, crowning moment crowning Charlemagne Pope year 800; them, talking about? For Chinese, laws like regulations, means towards larger end. Their attitude towards democracy follows parallel pattern. Democracy end itself, democracy means quite happy consider democracy useful means towards government appropriate places appropriate levels, democracy good. So village township level democracy, universal franchise. They approve slate candidates, fierce elections, fierce campaigning, incompetent arrogant despotic, get chucked out. But reach level cities provinces, say no. No direct democracy. Why not? Because believe, view universe, way produce good government. Any Catholic Church believes way elect Pope universal franchise. That parishioners decide parish priest. The Parish Council, maybe, that's ok. But parish priest? Bishops? Universal franchise? That's God's laws. They kind instinct embedded them, Communist, Chinese. And know much democracy, invariably leads 'localitis'; favouritism towards friends, relatives, people villages relationship with. We problem Singapore, fact problem exists throughout East Asia. Till today, apart Singapore, among Chinese communities among many East Asian communities, idea ultimate control business go outside family unpersuasive. You talk Li Ka-shing, talk Robert Kwok, talk Lim Soe Liong, talk them; go back family. Why? Because believe end, matters deepest level, trust. And family guarantees trust. This also Indian wisdom. So Marwaris controlling economy Calcutta, Parsees, Sindhis, Kishore member, Chettiars. They operate basis deep trust completely different level contract law. And distrust local affiliations, two dynasties, Ming Qing, senior official could serve within 400 miles born. No local official serve within 400 miles, words, Singapore, Singaporean govern Singapore. They go beyond that, today there's almost province China provincial leader province. Now consider this, transpose onto Europe, it's routinely, President France French. And German, disqualified Chancellor Republic. And Italian cannot trusted serve Rome. Ancient wisdom! What remarkable accepted legitimate. If Cantonese Northener squatting you, consider perverse abomination. This part life fact, likely impartial governor local boy there, likely favour related friends. So talk democracy Chinese, cultural backdrop. So applied Qing dynasty, Ming dynasty, taken step recently China. They introduced even rules, governing circumstances disqualified serving area near born. You can't stay ministry long, can't stay department long beacuse stay long, develop affiliations affiliations result sidedoors guanxi corruption. Of course, many rules still breached, scandals time time act scandals. For long central leadership pristine, system maintained. But one day become corrupt, many previous dynasties, downward spiral begins. And difficult situation reverse it. So I mentioned table India, it's country sustain revolution, deep structure would allow it. I think China country renewed periodic revolutions. Kishore asked when- I said well maybe 200 years time long cycles expect matter course history People's Republic would written People's Republic. It written next dynasty. Except right say shouldn't call dynasty, democrats, republic, Emperor...Well, whatever term call it, done much later. Let talk attitude towards religion. Being Roman Catholic I follow quite closely ups downs relationship Vatican I find quite fascinating. The Jesuits, went China Ming dynasty, hoped could convert Emperor, China would become Catholic great mission would achieved. They never succeeded. Some brightest minds Europe went there. Matteo Ricci, corrected Chinese calendar, repaired clocks palace, saw throne, never got meet Emperor died China. And tomb, it's compound Beijing Party School today. And church founded still today. 'Li Matou', that's called himself, applied permission buried China given permission. Then Manchus swept southwards, 1644, missionaries thought chance, "the Manchus bit accomodating towards us, yet Christianise China". So read despatches missionaries period, Tartar Wars described it, full hope. But chance. They appealed Second Emperor, Kangxi. "Can send missionaries?" "No problem". "Can report papal legate Beijing" "No thing". The Emperor imposed one condition: "you send many priests want China must die China, cannot leave that". You see, instinctively, Chinese, see Catholic Church, see someone like themselves, someone whose claim members total. And loyalty jealous one. Mind try control everything; control big things, dogma, doctrine. After left financially independent, big issue appoints ministers provincial secretaries, it's Pope appointing Bishops Bishops ordaining Priests governing vast empire, whether we're talking Chinese empire Catholic empire. They number members world interaction complex difficult one. And appointment Bishops, seek ultimate authority. In end got find way resolve it. I anticipate Vatican's argument "we realm, realm, please conflict". As Chinese leaders, attitude towards religion earliest days keep religion arm's length. Those govern empire, areligious, private religions, matters public conduct, Confucianist. In public, Catholic, Muslim, Buddhist. When Jesuits went China, impressed - possible create moral order based religion ethics. So impressed, wrote it, influenced people like Voltaire Encyclopedists. It helped inspire Frence revolution- could get rid Church, still maintain moral order society. I've talked China law, China democracy, China religion, let talk China foreign policy perhaps greatest interest; I talk generally experts field. I think it's difficult Chinese break old mindset [Zhong Guo], Middle Kingdom, center Universe, 'chopsticks peoples' semi-Sinic. I think consider Singapore semi-Sinic. Then beyond realm, Greeks would called Barbarians. The Mongols, Manchus, Europeans, Americans, Indians on. Now jargon course use today. They civilised, welcome great hospitality - lavish dinners, courteous words, offering best everything house. It reminded way mother used teach us home, big family stranger got treated well, visitor treated well, afraid visitor. So always treat visitors better family members visitor capricious, harm make sure fit in. Those within authority, always maintain order anyway. This way, minds, universe ordered. So I understand Koreans, Japanese, Vietnamese, extent, Singaporeans, feel uncomfortable see repetition pattern seen many times past. Will Chinese change principle foreign policy, I think have, because, never history met, existed close contact competing centers power, US, Europe, India, longer separated oceans cannot crossed, mountains cannot crossed, connected. So making adjustments. It interesting watch handle Olympics; Olympics become exercise pure Chinese nationalism, I think international reaction China severe. But I think Chinese sophisticated. I expect organise cheer teams Americans, Japanese, appearance courtesy common humanity. They careful ensure words fit conditions today. But let say defence many methods use arise fear, desire dominate. If analyse old tributary system, sent tributes got gave return. It became racket. So Japanese merchants competed get tokens [Ryukyu] order able China trade meant lot money. The Chinese fearful foreigners. They fearful Russians north, Muslims West, Indians across Himalayas, mostly Americans across Pacific. Their strategy keep temperature low, low profile, hide shine armour, shine sword, play game concentrate economic development. Internally make preparations? I doubt, deep fear. Is intention dominate, conquer, way European powers past? I don't think so. I don't think great desire turn non-Chinese Chinese. Maybe Korea, maybe Vietnam, maybe Mongolia, various points time part greater empire, might consider worth civilising. But beyond that, Sinicising Indians, Russians? No, I don't think want that. So become stronger powerful, I believe old nature re-assert itself, also reacting us. If find world threatening place, develop responses threats. Quite early day, wanted neutralise Southeast Asia, Asean. It never area threatened them, historically. So didn't worry Southeast Asia threat. But resources, sea lanes, go Southeast Asia. And made dramatic move years ago. Zhu Rongji ASEAN-China summit. He said, "free trade agreement". At time announced it, leaders ASEAN almost fell chairs. We thought China economic threat us. Not partner. Took us almost year digest implications say yes, let's negotiate. Step step. And time China assuring us would benefit would benefit. When Framework Agreement signed Zhu Rongji 2002 Phonm Penh, made two remarkable statements. He said 10 years, agreement benefits China benefits Southeast Asia, let us renegotiate it. I never imagine American USTR, European Trade Commissioner, talking like that. I mean contract, deal deal, it's settled eternity. Then said: "China seek exclusive position Southeast Asia", acknowledged going date one girl, intended promiscuous beginning. Towards Northeast Asia, I think complicated, much history legacy. Towards Central Asia, towards Russia, deep fears. Towards America, become relationship bound together many points, rupture would become unthinkable. But going difficult relationship, important difficult relationship manage century. If it's badly managed war, it's properly managed another generation peace hundreds millions people world would raised depths poverty. In area, experts, whenever I see China watch moves, I go back deep nature it's easy country vast, sense itself, depart much deep nature. Thank you.
