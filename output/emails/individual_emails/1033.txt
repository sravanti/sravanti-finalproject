Pis read following. I've followed case Torture homefront cries justice Comments <http://www.suntimes.com/news/marin/1734591,CST-EDT-caro126.article> August 26, 2009 BY CAROL MARIN <mailto:cmarin@suntimes.com> Sun-Times Columnist The feds can't -- yet -- deport Michigan restaurateur Ibrahim Parlak native Turkey. But frighteningly closer. And irony screams out. Carol Mann On Monday, day Eric Holder, President Obama's attorney general, announced would appoint special counsel investigate whether torture used CIA extract confessions foreign suspects, U.S. appeals court behest U.S. government ruled didn't problem sending Parlak back country tortured -- imprisoned 17 months, shocked electrodes, hung arms sexually violated. A Turkish Kurd, Parlak granted political asylum 1992. It government got cozier Turkey, re-classified Kurdish separatist movement "terrorist" attacks Sept. 11. With 9/11, Ibrahim Parlak's horror began anew. Suddenly looked different newly created Department Homeland Security Justice Department's Immigration courts. Instead seeing hard-working, tax-paying Chamber Commerce member ran Cafe Gulistan, small Middle Eastern restaurant resort town Harbert, Mich., tlie feds saw international menace. In 2004, FBI grabbed Parlak locked up. If hadn't volunteer team lawyers, including Reagan-appointed former U.S. attorney, former FBI anti- terrorism legal adviser bipartisan intervention Michigan's Sen. Carl Levin, liberal Democrat, Rep. Fred Upton, conservative Republican, Parlak would still jail. Thanks them, 47-year-old father 12-year-old girl temporarily free. But barely. The newest outrage 2-1 decision issued Cincinnati's 6th Circuit Court Appeals day Holder launched torture inquiry. B5 The majority opinion issued two Bush appointees put bench 9/11. Judge Julia Smith Gibbons Judge Jeffrey Sutton upheld Justice Department's Immigration courts ruling Parlak failed disclose relationship now-labeled terrorist organization even though never proven member. Let's remember something immigration courts. They independent. They work whoever attorney general. And past rulings Parlak came two now-controversial Bush appointees, John Ashcroft Alberto Gonzales. The fairness immigration rulings ripped none Judge Richard Posner 7th Circuit Court Appeals, one nation's brilliant judges. By September 2005, Posner noted "a staggering 40 percent 136 petitions" reversed due to, according one ruling, willingness ignore "the basic facts." Echoing Posner dissenting judge Parlak appeal. Judge Boyce F. Martin, Carter appointee, writes clarity conviction, arguing government's "awesome power used railroad man country." Like surgeon, Martin dissects Justice Department's immigration courts majority opinion colleagues, ends saying, "I remain hopeful, nevertheless, case sad remnant era paranoid, overzealous, error-riddled misguided anti-terrorism immigration enforcement gone wayside. It shame that, even hope proves true, late Ibrahim Parlak." Parlak's legal team appeal. Meanwhile, Holder, like Ashcroft Gonzales him, new boss immigration courts. As investigates questions U.S. torture abroad, here's hoping Holder examines ongoing domestic legal torture Ibrahim Parlak.
