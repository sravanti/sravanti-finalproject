Some military units, including Navy unit Guayaquil appeared support police. The police also occupied national congress. As rescue took place, head Ecuadoran Joints Chiefs Staff issued statement supporting president, noting armed forces respect rule law "in President [Rafael Correa] maximum authority three branches." Things calm. Reaction hemisphere one deep concern. The OAS adopted resolution; South American presidents call UNASUR travelled Buenos Aires likely go Quito support Correa. Several, including Garcia Santos, called Correa. Zapatero also spoke him. Moratinos tried reach around 6pm last evening convey news, I took call. As know, issued statement support Correa. I also gave interview CNN Spanish, re-played frequently. I strongly recommend call Correa today reiterate U.S. support government wish well. He appreciate but, broadly, sends signal United States supports constitutional order rejects attempt undermine it. Chavez Buenos Aires predictably declared behind unrest. We prepared call sheet you.
