And pasted exchange Corker Holbrooke: CORKER: Mr. Chairman, thank you. I want thank ambassador coming. I know wealth knowledge certainly served country many years. A number us wrote letter asking hearing, guess might hearings way. But reason wrote letter -- bipartisan letter -- provide Congress American people definition end state civilian operations Afghanistan, clear objectives civilian mission, detailed plan achieving objectives, specific, measurable metrics used measure progress towards achieving objectives. I say, I've hour 10 minutes. I heard nothing -- nothing -- that. And I respect ambassador, I've heard lot process. I've heard lot meetings. I earthly idea -- earthly idea objectives civilian front. And I don't know time begin right now, far incredible waste time, standpoint -- hearing, though. And I tremendous respect you, maybe wrong witness. I hope we'll maybe Secretary Clinton Eikenberry, maybe Crocker. I know he's supposed come. But could answer question purpose hearings first place? HOLBROOKE: I'm sorry. You don't feel I've told civilian programs are? CORKER: You've told lot process. I'd like know definition end state civilian operations, question asked set hearing up, Afghanistan, clear objectives -- -- detailed plan achieving those. I'd like hear talk that. I mean, I'm glad lot interagency folks here, I'm hearing anything talks we're going. I'd also like know withdrawal date that's set affects affects we're working country. HOLBROOKE: First all, Senator Corker, I believe I discussed civilian programs considerable detail within constraints time, prepare report committee earlier year, entered record I happy enter record again, wish. And go every one programs. The reason I brought colleagues show whole-of-government, unprecedented effort. Now, specifics, since want specifics, Afghanistan agricultural country. It exported agricultural products 1978 Soviet invasion. We trying rebuild it. This done first seven years war. We -- -- committee given us great deal money agriculture. And spending wisely joint AID- USDA effort, Senator Lugar particularly involved in, food, seeds, cash-for-work programs, encouraging alternatives opium production. HOLBROOKE: Secondly, rule law. We spending -- spending money authorized us create justice system cut Taliban's propaganda corruption lack justice system. Third, counter-narcotics. We ended poppy eradication, radical change, eradicating poppy seeds, poppy crops, driving farmers, poor farmers, hands Taliban. Fourth, major program subnational governance, putting aid directly district level. Fifth, major effort specific areas, alluded earlier, electricity Kandahar. Senator Kerry asked earlier Kandahar. One major issues bring electricity people benefit international presence. The whole range activities designed support country support General Petraeus' counter- insurgency effort. He I -- I counterpart two weeks ago moved Kabul. We worked intimately effort create joint civilian-military effort. And I happy provide every detail wish private briefings behalf team. Point number two regard end state issue raised. I want clear difference end state exit strategy. If -- personal view, senator -- walk away Afghanistan, again, 21 years ago, consequences similarly catastrophic, unique strategic position Afghanistan reaction would Pakistan, China, India country Afghanistan's west, Iran, well larger region includes Russia, Saudi Arabia, India, even extending Western Europe, concerned terrorism region, much are. So, I hope talk end state, talk sustainable end state involves continued American economic development assistance, continue fulfill obligations train police military. This cheap. But fraction money authorized appropriated military campaign. When able transition impossible anyone say. But won't single day. It gradual process. And review December president's decision-making focus on. CORKER: In foreign policy, generally speaking -- I know we've rough times last several years -- it's something we've able address bipartisan way. And I think issues you're dealing with, we're dealing Afghanistan incredibly tough. I still don't -- I haven't understood administration saying beginning. That's critical them. I don't understand. I still don't understand. I've met staff State Department. It's incredibly vague me. And I think doing, partners, include Pakistanis everybody around, don't know we're doing. They don't know we're leaving. They think we're leaving shortly, I think. We've colleagues come there. We've -- we've got president that's play sides, wants survive, doesn't know intentions are. The Pakistanis don't know intentions are, I don't think. And they're making accommodations sides. So, I tell you, I send letters parents spouses. And I feel lack clarity Afghanistan, we're Afghanistan, don't successful. And don't leave, things outlined. But I don't hear clarity. And again, I want support administration. I want support you, that's need country, let shores (ph) align (ph), let partisanship. But I tell you, person wants that, I still don't understand. OK? And I average intelligence, I would ask to, please -- maybe let's witnesses shed light specific. But I don't understand, I'm concerned. And I think we're sending lot mixed signals. And I think there's lot dissension. Actually, I listen you, even within administration itself, end. And I ask you, please. You lot experience, help us understand. You haven't done today. And I would ask chairman please witnesses come explain us end state is, envision Afghanistan whenever withdrawal take place, I still understand. We've changed it. Now it's sort degraded country conflict, it's control. I mean, bar continues change. And I'm concerned individual, yet I want us be, can, page much possible. But I think that, got much clearer outlined. HOLBROOKE: Senator, I'm sorry answers don't fully satisfy you. But I want clear this, I understand comments I respect them. First all, core question -- one asked constituents, I'm asked everybody -- Afghanistan? The short, simple answer 9/11, direct threats national security interests, fact enemies homeland Pakistani side border, single struggle. And strengthen Afghan government let -- teach stand feet time, move forward, things fall outside scope hearing, dismantle, deter defeat Al Qaida. Now, believe it's threat homeland, honest difference opinion. But I think Times Square bombing incident shows clearly dangerous situation is. Secondly, civilian mission, again, it's support single, civilian-military, counter-insurgency mission. And benchmarks, requested required Congress, submitted you. And overarching goal always same, disrupt, dismantle defeat Al Qaida prevent ability threaten United States. And believe, us -- division executive branch -- situation face direct threat. We believe Times Square situation occurred, I don't think anything could proved vividly. And achieve this, degrade Taliban well, part enemy's structure -- different part, integral part -- face. Now, Afghan government doesn't yet capacity deal own. How could 30 years war? And so, civilian part it, things I've mentioned -- police, government capacity, rule law, subnational government, training provincial officials, women's empowerment whole series major issues -- part civilian programs. And we're happy come back office -- appreciated visit us -- continue dialogue. Our civilian strategy designed keeping Al Qaida bay, it's designed help Afghan institutions establish conditions stable governance. Our plan benchmarks, briefed colleagues, we're happy discuss detail time.
