November 23, 2010 Effort Liberal Balance G.O.P. Groups Begins By MICHAEL LUO In may prove significant development 2012 elections, David Brock, prominent Democratic political operative, says amassed $4 million pledges last weeks moving quickly hire staff set hopes become permanent liberal counterweight airwaves Republican-leaning outside groups spent heavily year's midterm elections. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, former Maryland lieutenant governor eldest Robert F. Kennedy's 11 children, agreed serve chairwoman group, called American Bridge, lending still extremely nascent undertaking weight remains one significant families Democratic politics. Leading Democratic donors already pledged money group include Rob McKay, heir Taco Bell fortune chairman Democracy Alliance, partnership wealthy liberal donors; Robert Dyson, heads Dyson-Kissner-Moran, takeover acquisitions firm New York City; Marcia L. Carsey, television producer gave $1 million Democratic outside groups 2004. Mr. Brock said interview planned formally file papers Federal Election Commission Tuesday set American Bridge known independent-expenditure-only political action committee, meaning able take contributions unlimited size individuals corporations must regularly disclose donors. Certain set debate, however, Mr. Brock appears positioning new organization fund-raising consultants raise money Democratic-oriented media efforts American Bridge also via one nonprofit organizations Mr. Brock currently runs, Media Matters Action Network, disclose donors. The action network, tracks conservative politicians advocacy organizations, organized 501(c)(4) nonprofit group set take expanded role 2012 elections, including potentially running television ads, according internal draft concept paper American Bridge's Media Matter Action Network's plans obtained The New York Times. Mr. Brock said "money money," would actively solicit donors entities and, end, media spending would apportioned accordingly. The moves Mr. Brock recent weeks make concrete effort far part Democratic activists establish kind centralized structure hope become left's answer 2012 groups right U.S. Chamber Commerce, American Crossroads others, significantly outspent Democratic- leaning outside groups year. It early say whether Mr. Brock's group emerge go-to vehicle giant contributions left. Mr. Brock led much-heralded independent group 2008 presidential election failed gain much traction Obama campaign indicated preferred donors give groups. But Mr. Brock, former conservative journalist publicly disavowed right late 1990s, respected political player, drawn plaudits liberal donors running array groups Media Matters umbrella. Mr. Brock pointed various groups associated Media Matters raised combined $23 million year. Its backers include major Democratic donors like George Soros, billionaire recently announced given $1 million group; Peter B. Lewis, billionaire chairman Progressive Insurance, who, like Mr. Soros, gave $20 million Democratic-oriented groups 2004; Hollywood producer Steve Bing. "My donor base already constitutes major individual players historically given hundreds millions dollars types efforts," Mr. Brock said. "They need asked, I doubt step critical time." There also seems widespread agreement among Democratic activists donors need groups heavily involved 2012 elections. White House officials signaled recent weeks Obama administration would object Democratic- leaning outside groups getting involved 2012 elections, change Obama campaign's attitude toward groups 2008. But also indicated would prefer names donors disclosed. The lack disclosure among Republican-leaning outside groups became central Democratic talking point year spending outside groups right exploded midterm elections. But overriding desire part liberal donors activists hold White House win back lost House Senate may trump principles. Most political operatives agree easier raise money option offering anonymity available. "It would sort funny principle stand on, essentially tie one hand behind back," Mr. McKay said. Besides Mr. Brock, numerous Democratic activists discussions setting similar independent efforts. On Monday, instance, Steve Rosenthal, chief executive America Coming Together, Democratic fund- raising vehicle focused voter mobilization 2004 election, convened group political operatives, many active election, Washington restaurant discuss might done 2012. No one, however, apparently gone far Mr. Brock terms raising money formally setting organization. Mr. Brock said $4 million pledges group collected far deposited bank account end first quarter 2011. By way comparison, America's Families First Action Fund, one major Democratic independent efforts House races year, raised $4 million entire cycle mid-October. The internal concept paper American Bridge lays series priorities next year, including initially focusing attacking vulnerable Republicans Senate House, prelude major spending 2012.
