Overall speech worth reading; like I'll put weekend book. 2 passages particularly worth noting. 1. "Across Atlantic, Hilary Clinton pledged put women 'front center' American development agenda. That right choice. As David Cameron Jeff Sachs argued earlier year, women hold key development world's poorest countries — education, enterprise, micro-finance healthcare. Investing women pays dividends throughout entire community." 2. "I see DFID key, joined-up, integrated department, bright star Whitehall constellation, department state development developing world. That's DFID seat Cabinet table it's I won't satisfied message rings corridors every department Whitehall." We obviously don't love "dept state development language," noteworthy emphasis "joined-up" "integrated" dept — underlining fact DFID separate cabinet department almost divorced rest government.
