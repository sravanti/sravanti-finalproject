You mentioned Thursday's 8:45 meeting talked Qureshi thought going get trade access EU. My EU contact writes Member States EU slowing progress trade concessions Pakistan, although draft language negotiated w/ Pakistan still leaves room Commission (which pro-trade) keep working enhanced trade benefits Pakistan. Still, original timetable 2011 kept. Even ominous, agreement go European Parliament, Pakistan human rights reasons. I also read Esther's note UN Security Council Reform. You right overall best position moment Have good trip! AM
