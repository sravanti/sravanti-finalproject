Romney op-ed today's Wall Street Journal playing Stevens' murder say Obama put "security risk," etc. According Politico yesterday, internal argument within Romney campaign Libya. Obviously, neocons Rove oriented faction (Ed Gillespie, Rove's surrogate Romney campaign adviser) beat Stuart Stevens. Romney careening tactic tactic, hoping something catch. I wouldn't surprised see Romney raise specter Muslim Brotherhood charge Egypt & Libya bogeyman. I heard within last week. ----
