The New Public Diplomacy Joseph S. Nye 2010-02-10 CAMBRIDGE — The world traditional power politics typically whose military economy would win. In today's information age, politics also whose "story" wins. National narratives are, indeed, type currency. Governments compete organizations enhance credibility weaken opponents. Witness contest government protesters Iranian elections June 2009, Internet Twitter played crucial roles, recent controversy Google China. Reputation always mattered world politics, credibility become crucial "paradox plenty." When information plentiful, scarce resource attention. Under new conditions, soft sell may, ever, prove effective hard sell. For example, relative independence BBC, sometimes source consternation British governments, paid rich dividends credibility, illustrated account Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete's day: "he rises dawn, listens BBC World Service, scans Tanzanian press." Skeptics treat term "public diplomacy" mere euphemism propaganda miss point. Simple propaganda counterproductive public diplomacy. Nor public diplomacy merely public-relations campaign. Public diplomacy also involves building long-term relationships create enabling environment government policies. The contribution direct government information long-term cultural relationships varies three dimensions stages public diplomacy, three important. The first immediate dimension daily communications, involves explaining context domestic foreign-policy decisions. This dimension also involves preparation dealing crises. If vacuum information event, others rush fill it. The second dimension strategic communication, develops set simple themes, much political advertising campaign does. While first dimension measured hours days, second occurs weeks, months, even years. The third dimension public diplomacy development lasting relationships key individuals many years even decades, scholarships, exchanges, training, seminars, conferences, access media channels. These programs develop American journalist Edward R. Murrow called crucial "last three feet" — face-to-face communications, enhanced credibility reciprocity creates. But even best advertising cannot sell unpopular product. A communications strategy cannot work cuts grain policy. Actions speak louder words. All often, policymakers treat public diplomacy bandage applied damage done instruments. For example, China tried enhance soft power successfully staging 2008 Olympics, domestic simultaneous crackdown Tibet — subsequent repression Xinxiang arrests human rights lawyers — undercut gains. Great powers try use culture narrative create soft power promotes advantage, always understand it. Critics United States complain over-militarization foreign policy undercuts credibility. Instead, advocate diplomacy "on steroids," staffed diplomats trained new media, cross-cultural communications, granular local knowledge, networks contacts under- represented groups. The centralized mass-media approach public diplomacy still plays important role. Governments need correct daily misrepresentations policies, well try convey longer-term strategic message. The main strength mass-media approach audience reach ability generate public awareness set agenda. But weakness inability influence message perceived different cultural settings. The sender knows says, always targets hear. Cultural barriers apt distort heard. Networked communications, hand, take advantage two-way communications peer-to- peer relations overcome cultural differences. This type decentralization flexibility difficult governments accomplish, given central accountability structures. The greater flexibility non-governmental organizations using networks given rise call "the new public diplomacy," longer confined messaging, promotion campaigns, even direct governmental contacts foreign publics serving foreign-policy purposes. It also building relationships civil-society actors countries facilitating networks non-governmental parties home abroad. In approach public diplomacy, government policy aimed promoting participating in, rather controlling, cross-border networks. Indeed, much government control, even appearance it, undercut credibility networks designed engender. The evolution public diplomacy one-way communications two-way dialogue treats publics co-creators meaning communication. Power global information age, ever, include soft dimension attraction well hard dimensions coercion payment. Combining dimensions effectively called "smart power." For - example, current struggle transnational terrorism struggle winning hearts minds, over-reliance hard power alone path success. Public diplomacy important tool arsenal smart power, smart public diplomacy requires understanding credibility, self-criticism, role civil society generating soft power. If degenerates propaganda, public diplomacy fails convince, undercut soft power. Instead, must remain two-way process, soft power depends, first foremost, upon understanding minds others.
