As I mentioned last week, I panel Brussels forum Lady Ashton (who insisted everyone call Cathy), Estonian president Toomas lives, Senator Voinovich. Ashton I essentially reinforced every turn presented positive vision US-EU partnership. She scored significant victories lately, notably development included European Action Service (EAS) rather sitting separate desk (the formula seeking rather DFID formula). EU defense staff also included EAS. Indeed, Ashton chairs European Council whenever 27 foreign ministers, development ministers, defense ministers meet -- ultimate integrated frame. She also control number smaller development state- building budgets, though I gather biggest development fund still dispute development commissioner. Apparently, however, enlargement commissioner took cues strategy policy presented implementation plans Council, role wants. We able build way EU organizing pushing pushing integrated frame here. I hope everything goes well Ottawa NY. Bob Hormats I send note aspects Brussels forum, US well represented. AM
