See below. Will send PIR comments shortly. To: CDM Fr: Caitlin Re: Branch Book Overview: There surprises book. The "surprises" might exist buried took close reading pick on—the two main ones terror clause WJC's crime bill hadn't disclosed information Lewinsky (because hadn't wanted become witness her). There lot things covered My Life publications. Quite honestly book pretty boring much focused Branch I anticipated. While "and day, next day" My Life, share many elements would engage true Clinton fanatic historian. The fact appears index also makes difficult anyone looking quick hit get one. Furthermore, WJC's words interlaced Branch's recollection dictations, number direct WJC quotes far fewer I expected. HRC much player one might imagine. Her role largely seen interactions Branch recording WJC. Her statements consistent past, exception Gephardt comment, didn't grab much attention all.Ell (Others included HRC's devotion CVC, thought special prosecutor images returning meetings. They pretty much aligned interactions Branch.) Surprisingly, surprisingly, many problems discussed book those, face current Administration—Middle East peace, North Korea, China, etc... Branch repeatedly injects feelings specific subjects seems use book voice opinion Administration events time. He clearly topics prefers others (for example connection events Haiti result lot discussion it), subjects strikingly sparsely discussed Rwanda. Its absence long discussions surprising, appear thought WJC ever-dodged questions topic, weren't addressed. Much like My Life, one theme repeated WJC's conflict disdain media, especially long passages NYT Washington Post. There instances gives credit reporting, would hard-pressed find them. Additionally, numerous mentions WJC's acute allergies chronic fatigue, imagery falling asleep sessions couple occasions. The book quite bit Whitewater, given dearth public documentation little Branch could write hadn't said. One thing I recalled D'Amato's subpoena CVC's friends, later quashed, slept HRC's Rose Law Firm records White House. Branch portray helpful distinction WJC looked Whitewater scandals. While WJC attacks Whitewater political hunt, Branch WJC saying Filegate needed separated Whitewater, legitimate inquiry. There quips could catch someone's eye, WJC referring Paula Jones "a 'new bimbo' [WJC] didn't even recognize." Branch dwell Lewinsky impeachment. With exception Bruce, Bennett Kendall, lawyers mentioned. There one passage I looking into, WJC says part reason didn't mention relationship Lewinsky first threatened jail time found lying oath told truth could become witness her. This small passage could easily missed, one important note I don't recall hearing before. (This addressed fully below.) There relationships track book others. They include WJC's relationship Gore, maps part focal point end, contentious relationship Janet Reno. The one Senator appears discussed negatively Moynihan. All three issues discussed turn below. WJC portrayed extremely loving attentive father HRC portrayed much human light books/articles covering time period, ample mention relationship CVC images affection WJC, pre- post-impeachment. On foreign relations lot time spent discussing Middle East, Northern Ireland, Balkans, China, Russia, Pakistan/India beginning book, Haiti. (Note: Much written Haiti Branch's experience subject.) There also fair amount discussion North Korea, nothing discussed past weeks. Bin Laden discussed seems track mention My Life, seems detail background book. In certain cases detail My Life, example trip Pakistan WJC wrote USSS cancelled one stop would "defenseless" flying in, whereas Brach writes streets would lined "assassins." There candid looks WJC's take certain people relationship some, Albright Berger's dislike Holbrooke, detailed depiction Yeltsin's drinking, yelling outside Blair House cab get pizza. One thing note, often times WJC seems speaking Branch intentionally without recorders going, Branch writes interactions exchanges nonetheless. Such case HRC's Gephardt comment. The following items addressed memo: Wen Ho Lee Terror Clause Crime Bill 4 WJC Lewinsky's Silence 4 HRC Kissinger 4 HRC gay/lesbian 5 Tension Moynihan 5 HRC World Player 5 Jesse Jackson 6 Tension Janet Reno 6 Portrayal Carter 7 Relationship Gore 8 Other (This includes: Maggie recommending Panetta, HRC Haiti Invasion, ITAV co-author flap, Subpoenas CVC's Friends, Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex, Gore/HRC ticket, WJC suggesting Rubin run Senate, Trip South Asia) 11 Wen Ho Lee Terror Clause Crime Bill In discussing Wen Ho Lee's release Branch characterizes WJC's lack knowledge strained interpretation anti-terrorist provisions crime bill arbitrary detentions "confession." My Life mentions Lee's accusation passing discuss Lee. Below two passages Branch's book first giving context second Terror Clause Crime Bill. ➢ The year closed spies terrorism. The Justice Department, fierce debate among security agencies, indicted nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee fifty-nine counts copying classified material personal computer. Lee handled like radioactive espionage defendant—no bail, lockdown, solitary confinement—even though long dragnet produced evidence offered secrets China anyone else. The president said experts telling worst spies sometimes stored treason rainy day. This sounded fishy me. Clinton shrugged. Nothing would please establish Lee's innocence. [Branch, 577] ➢ While Lee indicted, Branch writes WJC noted others "were held secret, uncharged untried...He [WJC] embarrassed sponsored measure law without foreseeing arbitrary detentions...Under terrorist act, prosecutor decide within legal limit...whether bring charges testimony secret informant otherwise. To dismay, Clinton learned defendants held incommunicado six months. One extreme detention last three years. 'I think it's wrong,' [WJC] said. 'It's American. We accept guilty people street enjoy protect freedom.' [Branch, 629] WJC Lewinsky's Silence Branch writes part WJC's motive discussing happened Lewinsky could send jail, denied it. ➢ "Also, pointed Starr threatening jail Lewinsky year sworn denial affair. If Clinton come forward anything relationship, said Starr could turned witness Lewinsky, betraying discreet silence. Such subtleties, original, struck tendentious. The president never claimed chivalry real motive steadfast denial, dispute essential truth Lewinsky's account." [Branch, 511] HRC Kissinger The following could fodder people want continue string along notion channeling Eleanor Roosevelt. ➢ There passage HRC describes exchange Kissinger dinner complained health care bill passed wouldn't able see doctor. She continued say "it interesting, fact, dreamed Kissinger nights before. His visage turned suddenly effervescent banquet, announcing gladly worries Clinton health care bill dying. 'Oh, no, Dr. Kissinger,' replied coolly. 'Don't sure it's dead. We'll keep fighting, there's always light end tunnel.' She said Kissing blanched, speechless deft reminder Vietnam War...Now last, Hillary's dream, registered strategic designs spewed carnage venom seven needless years...'That's I dreamed,' Hillary repeated, lost thought. 'You know, I always get revenge dreams, never real life.' [Branch, 179] HRC gay/lesbian Writing call HRC NYS, Branch recalls WJC's counsel got "exercised." WJC left room. "He subdued return. 'You know, I've lot contact gay people life Hillary.' He sighed. Her temperament conservative, religious core, formed homosexual issues even mentionable. New York politics tough crucible, unsure heat could take. On hand, personal experience could speed adaptation." [Branch, 551] Tension Moynihan There several occasions throughout book Branch recalls WJC's grievances frustration Moynihan. For example: > When Moynihan called international arms embargo unilaterally lifted Bosnia could fight themselves, Branch writes, "The president flinched I mentioned [it]...'That's freebie him,' snapped Clinton, 'and knows it.'" [p.140] > In regard health care: "Echoing comments Hillary dinner, [WJC] faulted Senator Moynihan aimless hearings conducted without strategy theme." [p.170] ➢ Discussing Independent Counsel: "She [HRC] especially scornful Democrats, quoted number them. Senator Moynihan, instance, publicly said Clintons nice people sure nothing hide. 'Why investigation?' often asked. She said Moynihan skated blithely surface, never produced results Congress, could withstand scrutiny five minutes, living apartment secured chairmanship Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation." [Brach, 182] ➢ "Donnybrook" argument Moynihan said fundraising speech WJC gave citing regretted hypothetical controversial decision. Moynihan told press, "He doesn't understand...that he's conceding principles." WJC confronted lack context given statement press said Moynihan knew "feeding beast hostile presumption Clinton's motives." [Branch, 299] HRC World Player There several images HRC player world stage, WJC own. Several examples follow: ➢ Middle East: Discussing peace King Hussein: "They retreated lunch two couples—the Clintons, king wife, Queen Noor—in family dining room... Their agenda delicate race Hussein's failing health desire make peace Israel. The president said Hillary pounded away symptoms national estrangement: closed boarders, water disputes, travel barriers, war grievances, contested airspace, sealed electrical grids, on. Hussein gave feast goodwill without commitment point." [Branch, 170] > South Asia: Regarding trip South Asia CVC 1995, "Her [HRC's] schedule far demanding ceremonial, pushing conflict resolution civic empowerment downtrodden women." [Branch, 236] Later Branch tells Benazir Bhutto praising CVC HRC. "By contrast superficial American press, portrayed Hillary demure tourist policy significance exotic Asia, Bhutto said touched essential political chords whirlwind encouragements citizenship groups small-scale economic development." (The note contrasting Bhutto corresponds NYT article Branch quotes footer saying, "she [HRC] played traditional role First Lady wife mother...") [Branch, 246] > China Speech: Branch outlines HRC felt speech needed bigger China depicted "harsh reality everywhere" China Africa. He cites WJC commenting rave reviews HRC's speech. [Branch, 289] ➢ Regarding Russian financial system meltdown, Branch writes "Yeltsin seemed removed urgent political tasks Clintons counseled directly." [Branch, 512-513] Jesse Jackson Branch writes Jesse Jackson calling CVC Lewinsky story broke continued contact throughout period. WJC thanks support CVC. This goes detail WJCs gratitude, fact Jackson "counseled" CVC public knowledge dating back least 1999. ➢ "But Jesse done something would forget. When Lewinsky news broke, called Chelsea Stanford. Jesse nonfamily adult cell phone number. How got another story. Jesse said knew terrible her. Nothing like ever happened American politics. He know everything involved, wanted remind Chelsea much parents loved her. Their family needed stick together all, needed counsel, rage, pray, always available." [Branch, 497] Tension Janet Reno Throughout book, nomination her, WJC portrayed opinion negative opinion Janet Reno. > "He complained Janet Reno—made clear, fact, felt alienated attorney general. If removed her, however, pending decision yet another special prosecutor [for 1996 campaign finance] would fall Reno's deputy, Jamie Gorelick, who, Clinton feared, may share Reno's wholesale devotion outside control case president may become target...If removed Reno Gorelick, start fresh, would touch firestorm protest like Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre Justice Department officials Watergate scandal. That option." [Branch, 388-389] > Branch writes WJC talking Reno Louis Freeh disregarding letter D'Amato continuing allow independent counsel go Ciseneros. The held true Mike Espy. Branch outlines meeting WJC Reno. Reno made public statements "desire stay job. 'I told I didn't like one damn bit,' president said tersely. 'I didn't hire work New York Times Washington Post. I hired work me.'" [Branch, 398] He continues outline Clinton give Reno credit good achievements including coordination U.S. attorneys didn't blame special prosecutor Whitewater, "he blame abdicating responsibility supervise investigations ever since, letting mandates multiply almost will. She accepted criteria ludicrous crassly partisan. Reno failed defend presidency itself—not Clinton personally, institution—and extension entire executive branch...He told clue meant. His advisers considered naïve upright, fuzziness distinction seemed save her." [Branch, 399] He cites Clinton warned prepare staying job entire second term. Portrayal Jimmy Carter There parallels could drawn WJC/BHO Carter/WJC terms Carter's trip North Korea mission went Haiti. WJC clearly frustrated Carter's seeming desire front lines. North Korea: ➢ "On North Korea, [WJC] said Jimmy Carter initiated recent trip call Al Gore, Clinton approved volunteer mission break North Korea's extreme isolation... Sure enough, Carter reach North Korean dictator Kim Il-sung, proposed allow inspection North Korea's nuclear facilities exchange relief harsh economic sanctions. The hitch Carter announced terms CNN became official, adding gratuitously never agreed sanctions first place. News stories White House seething, Clinton made light spat. He said deal since ratified exchange letters, believe Carter would criticize official policy 'if game still doubt.' [Branch, 162] Haiti: ➢ After pushing sent Haiti enlisting Colin Powell Sam Nunn get WJC break Gore (who said Carter shouldn't trusted second time) Christopher approve mission Haiti seek truce junta, Carter portrayed acting stubbornly 'clientitis' (arguing acceptance Haitian generals versus United States' best interest). He didn't want leave WJC told to. Like North Korea, Carter again, Carter went press first. "The three negotiators flew back Washington late Sunday, Carter, invited stay White House, called CNN's Judy Woodruff midnight arrange interview next morning reported Clinton mission. This conduct, president said tersely, right...The press full retrospective stories friction three prominent negotiators...He said current newsweeklies lapped criticism Carter embarrassment Clinton...Many advisers griped Jimmy Carter thought still president, Clinton found criticism jaundiced. Carter spoken restraint joint press conference, allowed, exhibiting keen political ear...To Clinton, Carter simply felt earned right speak mind international statesman, even mission accepted United States government complete Air Force jet. This sense entitlement could make Carter thorn, Clinton thought value far outweighed political annoyance. He considered Carter sterling ex- resident." [Branch, 200-201] Dispatch Bombers Near Iraq ➢ "He expected military strikes win bipartisan assent, including former presidents Ford, Reagan Bush. 'Dole support me,' said. 'Carter probably criticize me. Carter always criticizes, doesn't much positive say." [Branch, 518] Gore For majority book, little discussion WJC Gore's relationship. There places briefly mentioned couple scenes levity. The end, however, describes seemingly brutally candid conversation two 2000 election impeachment. ➢ On page 92 Branch writes, "No, [Clinton] ask Gore take failed foreign policy, alleged, improve public presentations troika 'bad talkers': shy National Security Adviser Tony Lake, boring Secretary State Warren Christopher, disorganized Defense Secretary Les Aspin." [Branch, 92] ➢ In one-passage WJC talks asking Gore lead independent review Hazel O'Leary also Gore substitute economic conference Japan. The latter fare well nations offended Gore, WJC attended. Gore insisted WJC needed go Japan redeem administration absence. Gore pointed days January, WJC "pronounced vital Chelsea's schoolwork. Gore blinked. So what?...Mutual exasperation spiked. `Al,' Clinton told him, 'I going Japan leave Chelsea take exams.' Gore erupted. He thought Clinton lost bearing. They big fight, said president, still wrangling dates Japan." Branch states fight wound around time WJC saw Lewinsky. [Branch, 316-317] ➢ On page 396-397 scene, shows Gore's sense humor Gore, WJC, et al working team secure Cabinet second term. ➢ Later passage exchange WJC HRC Gore trying hire second criminal lawyer. HRC already knew paying first one $30,000 per month. The conversation leak offer Jim Neal TN, former Watergate prosecutor defend Gore free. The exchange ethics offer leak press Gore. ➢ On Gore's announcing campaign. "The president called twice congratulate Gore kickoff events—once Geneva, hours later Paris. Clinton thought glitches technical... But Gore got big things right. His twofold message perfect: distinguish Clinton's personal flaws, tell voters exactly would White House. The president said fine Gore call Clinton's affair Monica Lewinsky 'inexcusable.' First, true. Second, showed necessary strength criticized boss. Third, Gore would badgered death did. 'Al,' Clinton told him, 'if thought would help campaign, I would let flog noon right doorstep Washington Post.'" [Branch, 553-554] Branch continues WJC told Gore ignore reporting offended critical campaign. "On tape, president said confided chief strategic worry Gore Gore's pollster, Mark Penn. The vice president must project platform—where stood, precisely would lead country—because Republicans would try knock substance." [Branch, 554] ➢ WJC offered critiques Gore's campaign throughout, always framed fear Gore succeeding him. For example, "Clinton still thought Gore could win. Most people considered smart, experience, motivated. He examined pitfalls Gore campaign showcasing presidential character detailed agendas country. Reporters called Gore "stiff," Clinton discounted liability. He thought Gore's droll sense humor would wear well time. Gore also perceived conventional Democrat, therefore lacking independence, called Gore emphasize passion initiatives. Then president said Gore could brooding quality him, worrisome off-putting itself, potentially damaging serious nature failed give voters lifted. Clinton isolated word "sunny." Gore needed it." [Branch, 599] ➢ He also complimented Gore's knowledge government workings. "Gore knew Washington. Believe me, said president, administration would made many errors first two years vice president." He goes say WJC suggested Gore find someone would bright spot run with, perhaps Durbin Bradley Kerrey, although also goes great detail virtues Mikulski, even though would never get chosen. How much WJC's emphasis versus Branch's focus home state senator unclear. [Branch, 599, 618-19] ➢ WJC criticized Gore running successes administration. "They running essentially third term, said president, afraid Clinton-Gore record would tarnish Clinton's character." [Branch, 623] Branch gives WJC's critique Gore debate heard before—that Gore lacked style light touch. ➢ Branch WJC recalling conversation WJC Gore "Gore bared one stressful consultations insisting he, Gore, good politician, elaborating meant good policy, also good politics, admitted instinctively blend two. Gore said think it, Clinton thought pretty close bone...He stuff great president, message Clinton must convey somehow without seeming brag record." [Branch, 623-624] ➢ The big passage Gore begins page 641 extends 645. Branch notes WJC unsure first recording details. At outset says, "For part, Gore angry, blame Clinton defeat, wanted acknowledge forthrightly people around did." [Branch, 642] It WJC acknowledging Gore's use proper—he best White House. Then says, "'I think made mistake use last ten days,'" Clinton told Gore, 'but otherwise big deal. I much upset message, we're honest.'" [Branch, 642] Branch recalls WJC saying Gore fought bag saying "Clinton's drag plagued every direction." Clinton said Gore better governance Clinton, Gore would better nation Bush, "unparalleled" vice president, "blind spots." Branch writes WJC kept saying confrontation "surreal." o Gore "fresh grievance...he wanted Clinton know Buddhist temple fund-raising scandal worst experience life. No one ever questioned personal integrity, corrosive publicity whispers tormented four years. Gore said disposed blame Clinton. However, remembered telling president found English-speaking person one Asian fund-raisers. And president charge party apparatus supposed screen donations trouble. So blame Clinton way. The president told could scarcely believe ensuing tales suspicion. Gore must still shock election, unhinged. 'I thought Neverland,' said." [Branch, 643-644] o Branch continues: "The vice president asked Clinton Monica Lewinsky. He supported Clinton impeachment, publicly privately, declaring disappointed. Yes, said president. He appreciated that. However, persisted Gore, Clinton confide personal feelings. He never explained exactly happened. There little say, Clinton replied, beyond failure regret. He humiliated angry, made mistake. He misled American people, sorry. Gore closed point emphasis. Well, said, first time apologized personally. Clinton double take...Gore treated confession watershed. Their colliding perspectives made angry. Clinton exploded Gore's reaction phony. What significant here?...Gore exploded back. He feeling stubborn repeat defensiveness delayed honesty somehow cost election. Clinton's character root it..." [Branch, 644-45] Other ➢ Maggie Person Recommending Panetta: Unlike My Life, Branch's book, WJC asking Maggie compile confidential suggestions McLarty's replacement. "Williams shrewd, discreet, efficient." [Branch, 161] > HRC Haiti Invasion: Branch asked WJC HRC thought foreign policy team's suggestion invade Haiti. "He said pell-mell rush invade crazy her. Reacting pressure, lack options, sense trapped, said badly served foreign policy staff. He said observed suspicion chief sponsors invasion—Lake, Berger, Talbott—were people pushed ill-fated appointment Bobby Ray Inman defense secretary." [Branch, 189] > ITAV: ITAV co-author flap Sally Quinn spread rumors HRC written book. Quinn said HRC denied credit book's collaborator, Barbara Feinman, friend Quinn. HRC said Feinman withdrawn project. Branch notes White House draft chapters HRC's handwriting. (Branch turned affected ghostwriter.) From HRC said Quinn friends launched rumor HRC female veterinarian Socks' "discovered...in flagrante bedroom floor White House." [Branch, 342-343] > Subpoenas CVC's Friends: Branch tells D'Amato, Chair Banking Committee, subpoenaed might White House HRC's Rose firm records there. This included "some two dozen Chelsea's sleepovers." Senator Sarbanes quashed subpoenas sleepovers. [Branch, 362] ➢ Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex: In context Lewinsky, Branch says Vernon Jordan, "In glancing associations, I picked Vernon attitude toward extramarital sex best described lighthearted recreational." [Branch, 495] > Gore/HRC ticket: "By numbers, Clinton's gut, Gore-Hillary ticket would give Democrats best chance defeat Bush White House. 'Hands down,' [WJC] said, tut I don't think Al would ever it.'" [Branch, 540] > WJC suggesting Rubin run NY Senate seat: The passage comes WJC talks supporting HRC decided run, raises question whether preferred Rubin whether two events unconnected. "When president urged [Rubin] run easily win New York Senate seat, Rubin recoiled...He could fathom Hillary wanted run now..." [Branch, 557] ➢ On trip South Asia: Branch says WJC agreed cancel stop Bangladesh, "of hard intelligence Osama bin Laden lined route assassins." [Branch, 594] My Life discusses cancelled trip specify bin Laden assassins. DI 'Gephardt asshole," Hillary commented. The president, pointing recorders, advised gently tapes on. She winced shrugged smile. "Well, is," insisted. In awkward silence, I backed machines erase first lady's epithet." [Branch, 263]
