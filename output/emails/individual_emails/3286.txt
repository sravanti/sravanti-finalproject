H: If Roubini right, he's mostly right far, one few, without additional large stimulus devoted putting floor job loss, pressure protectionism far intense. (Protectionism, name, dismissed targeted tool ongoing policy force China revalue currency. The US without means here.) The deficit high case Republicans always attempt exploit matter number. Whether another stimulus pass Congress another matter. Still, matters short-run--and long-run--are achievable results. To people, deficit abstraction; employment housing--and insecurity both--are vital, concrete immediate issues.

Wrong. Conditions U.S. labor markets awful worsening. While official unemployment rate already 10.2% another 200,000 jobs lost October, include discouraged workers partially employed workers figure whopping 17.5%. While losing 200,000 jobs per month better 700,000 jobs lost January, current job losses still average per month rate 150,000 last recession. Also, remember: The last recession ended November 2001, job losses continued year half June 2003; ditto 1990-91 recession. So expect job losses continue end 2010 earliest. In words, unemployed looking work waiting economy turn corner, better hunker down. All economic numbers suggest take while. The jobs coming back. There's really one hope leaders turn things around: bold prescription increases fiscal stimulus another round labor-intensive, shovel-ready infrastructure projects, helps fiscally strapped state local governments provides temporary tax credit private sector hire workers. Helping unemployed extending unemployment benefits necessary sufficient; leads persistent unemployment rather job creation. The long-term picture workers families even worse current job loss numbers alone would suggest. Now way sharing pain, many firms telling workers cut hours, take furloughs accept lower wages. Specifically, fall hours worked equivalent another 3 million full time jobs lost top 7.5 million jobs formally lost. This bad news must face facts. Many lost jobs gone forever, including construction jobs, finance jobs manufacturing jobs. Recent studies suggest quarter U.S. jobs fully out-sourceable time countries. Other measures tell ugly story: The average length unemployment time high; ratio job applicants vacancies 6 1; initial claims continued claims high millions unemployed resorting exceptional extended unemployment benefits programs staying longer. Based best judgment, likely unemployment rate peak close 11% remain high level two years more. The weakness labor markets sharp fall labor income ensure weak recovery private consumption anemic recovery economy, increases risk double dip recession. As result terribly weak labor markets, expect weak recovery consumption economic growth; larger budget deficits; greater delinquencies residential commercial real estate greater fall home commercial real estate prices; greater losses banks financial institutions residential commercial real estate mortgages, credit cards, auto loans student loans thus greater rate failures banks; greater protectionist,pressures. The damage extensive severe unless bold policy action undertaken now. Roubini professor Economics Stern School Business New York University Chairman Roubini Global Economics.
