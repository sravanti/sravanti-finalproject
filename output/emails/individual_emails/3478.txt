I've asked Todd identify specific areas thinks progress made discussions Thursday. At high level, I think leaders' conversations Thursday begin narrow gaps big issues -- transparency, funding, inscribing commitments, etc -- IF (and it's big if) gaps narrow-able. If they're not, Thursday/Friday days trying failing ... least trying. Todd's view enough time Friday top-level meetings close deal; two days required. You would head delegation first, POTUS second.
