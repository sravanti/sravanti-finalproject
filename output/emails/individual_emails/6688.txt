I know I'm supposed lift head QDDR, thought would like see — it's ideas wanted promoted picked me. AM The Crossroads Nation By DAVID BROOKS Bill Clinton used talk building bridge 21st century. President Obama talks laying "new foundation." But Clinton always vague land side bridge going look like, Obama vague edifice going go top foundation. They vague nobody clear sort country America going 2030 2050. Nobody quite defined America's coming economic identity. In thinking question, probably helps start beginning. Five hundred years ago, agriculture major economic activity. One hundred years ago, industrial production. Now, course, we're living information age. Innovation creativity engines economic growth. Howard Gardner Harvard put together composite picture extraordinarily creative person: She comes little place somewhat removed center power influence. As adolescent, feels outgrowing small circle. She moves metropolis finds group people share passions interests. She gets involved team create something amazing. Then, point, finds problem, related yet different problems concern others group. She breaks struggles finally emerges new thing. She brings back circle. It tested, refined improved. The main point composite story creativity solitary process. It happens within networks. It happens talented people get together, idea systems mentalities merge. Now imagine creative person year 2010, 2025 2050. You living small town Ukraine Kenya place, foreign domestic. You long break go place people gathering think things thinking about, creating things want create. If passionate fashion, maybe go Paris. If it's engineering, maybe it'll Germany. But passionate many spheres, I suspect you'll want America. You'll want U.S. English become global language. You'll want come American universities lead world research draw many best minds corners earth. You'll want American institutions relatively free corruption. Intellectual property protected. Huge venture capital funds already exist. Moreover, United States universal nation. There already people connections world. A nation immigrants permeable say, Chinese society. You also observe America hosts right kind networks — ones flexible intense. Study study suggests America one societies high social trust. Americans build large, efficient organizations bound circles kinship clan. Study study finds Americans hierarchical. American children raised challenge parents. American underlings relatively free challenge bosses. In country you're less likely submit authority. From story see economic power 21st century going look like economic power 20th century. The crucial fact new epoch creativity needs hubs. Information networks need junction points. The nation make crossroads world tremendous economic political power. In 2009, Anne-Marie Slaughter, director policy planning State Department, wrote essay Foreign Affairs laid logic new situation: "In networked world, issue longer relative power, centrality increasingly dense global web." Slaughter's essay titled "America's Edge." That apt. Americans depressed state mind. As China India rise, nearly two-thirds Americans believe nation decline. In fact, U.S. well situated crossroads nation. It well situated center global networks nurture right kinds networks. Building America means everything possible thicken connections: finance research attract scientists; improve infrastructure ease travel; fix immigration funnel talent; reform taxes attract superstars; make study abroad rite passage college students; take advantage millions veterans served overseas. The nation thickest expansive networks define age. There's reason pessimistic that.
