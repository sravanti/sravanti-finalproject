See piece defamation religion. Not bad. http: I /www.economist.com/world/international/displavstorv.cfm?story id=15833005 Religion human rights The limits freedom faith Mar 31st 2010 From The Economist print edition Opponents bid Muslim states "protect religion" claim small success How dare call us blasphemers? IT DOES happen often: Christian lobbyists, sort favour prayer American classrooms crucifixes Italian ones, lining side secularists battle curb religion's role public square. But camps quiet satisfaction recent vote United Nations. Not outcome, slim margin defeat. On March 25th Human Rights Council (HRC), Geneva-based UN agency often exasperates Western members, voted 20 votes 17, eight abstentions, text lists "defamation religion" infringement liberty. Nothing amazing there: Organisation Islamic Conference (OIC), groups 56 mainly Muslim states (plus Palestine), working push resolutions kind General Assembly UN bodies since 2005. But margin smallest ever, opponents think could good chance defeating "defamation" motion next time one comes around. The OIC's idea establish principle faiths need protection, individuals do. It denies sinister intention (see article). And ears, OIC's effort sounds like harmless UN-speak, nothing more. (The United States Commission International Religious Freedom, congressionally mandated body, noted logical flaw: defamation means harming reputation living person entity: implies one can't defame idea religious founder longer, least physically, alive earth.) But critics OIC campaign, include atheists, Christians indeed Muslims, say "defamation" idea worse hot air: far protecting human rights, emboldens countries use blasphemy laws criminalise dissent. What encourages critics countries seem coming around view. Mexico, Uruguay, Argentina, Zambia South Korea voted latest resolution. Brazil criticised text abstained. Deeper still inside UN's bureaucracy, another battle religion rages—and stakes could even higher. An "ad hoc committee" mulling ways amend extend UN convention racial discrimination. Certain states want language would fuse categories race faith; want new convention, protocol existing one. For secularists (in broad sense people, including believers, oppose idea faith privileged access power), alarming. Non-binding resolutions defamation bad enough; UN treaty race-plus-religion would legal force, least signatories, give heart theocrats. At HRC's latest discussion effort March, Algerian oversees project keen plough ahead. But countries like Switzerland, Japan, Mexico, Argentina France retorted would better enforce existing UN norms dream new ones. Efforts widen racism accord resume, new chairman, late year—but critics relieved stalled it. Still, would-be theocrats may focus harder adding racism charter, face real risk defeated defamation, view Roy Brown, Geneva spokesman International Humanist Ethical Union. Meanwhile Christian-inspired NGO, European Centre Law Justice, denouncing abuse blasphemy laws many OIC member states. How fair point? It easy case make, example, Pakistan. Some 41 complaints blasphemy registered police Pakistan last year, says country's independent Human Rights Commission. In theory, blasphemy punishable death—a penalty handed never carried out. Worst-hit law minorities like Christians Ahmadis, group whose claim Muslim rejected Pakistani state. Although abuse law less rife 1980s, Islamist general tightened rules, law still invoked disputes (over property, say) nothing faith. "The vulnerable people, religious minorities, continue charged blasphemy," said Ali Dayan Hasan, researcher Human Rights Watch, campaign group. "But people convicted? No. Rarely. It used instrument political social coercion." When convictions occur, lead long jail terms; pre-trial detention last years. Pakistan's parliament revising constitution left intact religious bits, despite vow ruling party review blasphemy laws. (Indonesia stepped back move liberalise blasphemy regime.) On Pakistani streets, law dire effects. In January 2009, village Punjab province, five Ahmadis, labourer four children, charged blasphemy. They supposedly written "Prophet Muhammad" wall mosque toilet. The children behind bars nearly six months till charge quashed. And last September young Pakistani Christian accused throwing part Koran drain. It seems real crime, however, affection Muslim woman. A mob torched church, many Christians flee. He taken jail, died days later. His family alleged torture; authorities claimed suicide. There mayhem funeral country's Christians (see picture) appalled. In places, "defamation" faith threatens rights measures supposedly defend it.
