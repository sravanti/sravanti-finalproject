The reported death toll topped 150,000, reconstruction needs incalculable. How starting 700,000-strong national civic service corps made Haitian youth? There many reasons entity makes lot sense. Haiti young country. An estimated 70% population 30; 15-to-29 segment alone makes 50% population. Demographers long cautioned excessively youthful populations potentially exacerbate underdevelopment accentuate political instability. Although Haiti registers among lowest levels education Western Hemisphere, Haitian youth wellspring creativity, talent potential. You don't need community-development specialist know stifled lack meaningful opportunities. Fortunately, Haiti enabling environment set civic service corps. Article 52 Haitian Constitution commits citizens national service, though never activated. What more, many Haitian international organizations mobilized ready help government get going.

Hundreds humanitarian agencies, donor governments nongovernmental organizations facing monumental challenges coordinating relief assistance.

Before earthquake, Viva Rio Brazilian peacekeepers recruited trained hundreds Haitian youth, including former gang members, provide relief services Haiti's slums. This program could reactivated scaled quickly. A civic service corps could draw lessons groups target recruit youths for, say, two years. The Haitian government would, course, need one manage undertaking, direct oversight president's office Interior Ministry. And many countries could provide advice support.
