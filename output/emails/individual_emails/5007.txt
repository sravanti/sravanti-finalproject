FYI: From one folks hired working Pierre Louis: Lessons Aceh Nias Multi-Donor Trust Fund 1. The Government Indonesia (G01) responded Tsunami issuing series government decrees, immediately organized overview relief efforts ensure rational coordinated response. The first task produce Damage Loss Assessment (DLA). The DLA followed detailed Master Plan Rehabilitation Reconstruction (MPRR). The MPRR provided in-depth sector plans, spatial planning, governance supervision arrangements finances considerable attention avoid minimize corruption. The process behind MPRR consultative, wide range local stakeholders public offices heard. The MPRR presented 26 March, 3 months Tsunami. 2. The MPRR form basis general three-stage strategy. The Relief phase originally set six months, reduced three: January- March 2005. The Rehabilitation phase run 21 months, December 2006, Reconstruction phase July 2006 December 2009. The MPRR provides well defined phasing interventions. 3. The objectives Relief efforts humanitarian relief: rescue; food medicine; emergency infrastructure temporary shelter; burying dead. The Rehabilitation phase restore services minimum level: public services; economic facilities; banking financial institutions; trauma treatments; secure land rights; law order; temporary shelter. Finally, Reconstruction rebuild region: rebuilding economy (production, trade banking); transportation, telecommunications, social cultural systems; improving institutional capacity; housing. 4. The Government set ministerial-level agency manage MPRR program Aceh itself, Rehabilitation Reconstruction Agency Aceh Nias. The BRR formally established end April 2005 became operational early May. The World Bank Board 30 March 2005 formally established Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDF) Steering Committee comprised BRR, GOI, donors civil society. Having credible local coordinators key success. 5. The EC channels nearly 93% funds MDF, 2.5% USD 400 million US goes MDF. While payments fund slow, disbursements begin even slower. By October 2005, project agreements USD 200 million signed, USD 3 million actually disbursed. Disbursements picked pace thereafter. The delay caused two principal impediments: first, donors quick pledge funds, getting exact written agreements place took time. This points need donors flexible regarding formal agreements, accept simple, generic paragraphs contribute speedy resolution slightly differing phrasings concerns. Second, processing time project approval implementation concern. Since MDF funded projects on-budget, implemented government institutions. This crated bottlenecks. 6. Smaller donors joined wished support reconstruction efforts Aceh capacity often strong views best pursue this. They want Bank assume fiduciary responsibilities funds high-risk environment, also take lead ensuring funds go prioritized activities. The MDF thus seen well-managed bank account paid- administrative services. However, all-inclusive Steering Committee made membership large extent unwieldy, forced discuss policy operational issues. 7. The Multi Donor Fund Secretariat developed Outreach Strategy includes regular radio talk shows, field visits meet discuss beneficiaries communication advertisements well telephone hotline. 8. MDF received praise engaging Government Indonesia (G01) policy dialogue. The MDF thus entry point engaging conditions sustainability, relevance impact. 9. Because MDF accept strict ear marking donor contributions — though allow preference indications — means funds freely available programming according criteria priorities MDF agrees to. Given strong GOI participation, MDF seen successful instrument harmonization coordination environment criticized lack coordination. The MDF's Mid Term Review conducted 2008-2009 found MDF made positive contribution harmonizing donor efforts increasing effectiveness efficiency reconstruction effort. 10. The MDF sufficiently engage private sector coherent job creation strategy. The MDF lacked executive rights, GOI BRR credited leveraging decisive response.
