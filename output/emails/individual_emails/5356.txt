See hus analysis EAS also US, Japan, Chinese urbanization trade patterns.. Nothing new, valuable coming him. The Australian - 19 Jun 10 Embracing everyone US India Greg Sheridan, Foreign editor GEORGE Yeo, Singapore's Foreign Minister, one dazzlingly clever people could meet Southeast Asia. Singapore society notoriously produces hardheads strategic outlook. But Yeo combines Singapore's characteristic hard-headedness depth historical understanding context, well lively human sympathy diversity region surrounds him, I, event, find almost unique. I remember interviewing height East Asian economic crisis 1997 asking whether crisis shattered idea Asia growing centre global economy, numerous foolishly triumphalist Western commentators suggesting. "No doesn't," Yeo told me. "At might put back forecasts five 10 years." It moved graph little right, didn't change trends. On that, Yeo absolutely right. But also Yeo's ability apply insights history real problems Asia today make formidable. This week, Yeo spent days Australia I caught one slightly mesmerising historical tour de force conversations specialises. It secret Singapore serious reservations Kevin Rudd's proposal establish Asia-Pacific Community. The Prime Minister wanted US, India Russia included regional body could deal strategic issues well trade economics. Singapore's hesitation Rudd proposal came thought Association Southeast Asian Nations, key member, could sidelined. I asked Yeo whether region clear wanted organisations accomplish. "We still need lot discussion," said. "The vision going change dramatically, emergence China India global stage. The configuration evolving much faster us would preferred. But that's reality we've got work with. We need regional architecture able accommodate stresses. The single important relationship US China. Increasingly, relationship India China becoming important. I think eventually triangular relationship decide big issues war peace Asia century - triangle consisting US, China India." Yeo saw Rudd Foreign Minister Stephen Smith Canberra describes Canberra Singapore harmony evolution regional organisations. This saw played out: "When Prime Minister Rudd proposed APC, Dick Woolcott (Rudd's envoy) went round region. He visit countries. He made quite plain big countries ASEAN need involved. We talked among quite soon conclusion reached ASEAN going sidelined. So immediate blowback region. "To PM Rudd's credit quickly clarified this, ASEAN central conception APC vision beginning. I said, 'All us region relieved hear that'. "Separately (former Japanese) prime minister (Yukio) Hatoyama articulating view East Asian region apparently centred China, Japan Korea. It created, would expect, natural reaction Southeast Asia. That got us thinking region. How keep Russia US region way that's comfortable. For long time we've thinking China, recently India." Yeo pointed earlier regional organisations also evolved slowly, particular East Asia Summit, includes Australia New Zealand, well ASEAN, China, Japan, South Korea India. He said: "It took us long time create EAS structure. Some preferred based ASEAN plus three (China, Japan, Korea), harking back (former Malaysian prime minister) Mahathir (Mohamad)'s East Asian caucus. "Others felt that's limiting. If it's ASEAN plus three, may little lop-sided economic weight plus three. So thought India one side, Australia New Zealand south, there's certain natural equipoise. "Then took many discussions. The Russians wanted join EAS felt rushed. Russia important country. There unhappiness Russians accommodate EAS time. (Former US) President (George W.) Bush want join EAS worried EAS might exclude US region. We told American friends could purely Asian thing Australia New Zealand it. In case, countries like Singapore would never want EAS exclusive. What would threaten us world developed blocs." So end today? "When I met PM Rudd I thanked helping catalyse thinking ASEAN. So two possibilities, either EAS expanded Russia US separate ASEAN plus eight (including US Russia) configuration. In fact I interesting discussion Prime Minister Rudd. I think end he's happy let ASEAN members decide doesn't want interfere regional discussion." So describe Yeo outlines either win loss Rudd. Whatever evolves, nobody going call Asia-Pacific Community one going imagine Rudd founder, everyone accepts Bob Hawke founded APEC 1989. On hand, seem though it's much likely finally regional organisation embracing everyone US India, able discuss security. That pretty much Rudd's policy aim and, Yeo constructively puts it, Rudd influenced ASEAN thinking. Friends Rudd describe embodiment vision fulfilment initiative. His enemies say APC came nothing failure Australian diplomacy. Certainly Yeo casts constructive light. There space give smallest sampling Yeo's prodigiously rich insights issues. On US, said: "Both Australia Singapore feel bones US remain great power many decades. It vast country always throwing new ideas, always boil. It sunny disposition. We Singapore Australia feel bones one way another get current difficulties." On China, I asked whether political development keeping pace growth power, financial military, could manage new power way beneficial everybody. Yeo stressed sure Beijing's preoccupations internal, said: "China No 1 trading partner Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, India already No 2 New Zealand, countries (in Asia) graph points direction." (The historical process) high drama China. It historically large rural peasantry Maoism developed different ideology Bolshevism. China 20 per cent urban. It's 40 per cent urban go 80 per cent 90 per cent. The urbanisation Europe languid comparison, look Dickens Victor Hugo. Look huge reaction Europe urbanisation industrialisation. In China it's compressed. If succeed greatest nation Earth. The Chinese know learn new tricks. The skills brought power won't keep power." He recalled early China's economic modernisation program fascinated Singapore, mostly Chinese nation, ran society orderly effective manner, combining rapid economic growth social order respect tradition. Then interest seemed wane. But Chinese delegations back large numbers, fascinated particularly Singapore manages politics big booming city. Mainland Chinese even sitting politicians' electoral clinics Singapore, observing real problems recognised, integrated system dealt with. I asked Yeo whether thought Japan could sustain stabilising role played Asia past 60 years. He replied: "Their politics mess. Partly fit pieces together closely, reconfiguring pieces is- difficult. A lot Japanese politics fitting pieces together pulling apart. "The DP1 came power determined pull pieces apart, Liberal Democratic Party big business bureacracy. Never write Japan off. It takes long time change change fury intensity surprises everyone." Japan gone profound periods change past - Meiji Restoration 19th century, decided become modern nation; pervasive change World War II, decided embrace democracy role key US ally region. The fact grappling change reason think cannot emerge successful model. Yeo old, old friend Australia, sense long-term champion Australia's involvement Southeast Asia. He minister Singapore government 20 years. He embodies great deal institutional memory strategic continuity, within Singapore within broader councils region. It's pity doesn't visit us bit often.
