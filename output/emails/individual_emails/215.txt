I'm especially pleased Morocco's commitments take deeply troubling problem child marriage.

When us people faith - I one — feel pain insults, misunderstanding, denigration cherish, must expect others resort violence, That universal standard expectation, everyone's obligation meet that, make differences, expect less expect others, You cannot respond offensive speech violence without begetting violence. And I strongly believe great religions world stronger insults. They withstood offense centuries. Refraining violence, then, sign weakness one's faith; absolutely opposite, sign one's faith unshakable. So tonight, must come together recommit working toward future marked understanding acceptance rather distrust, hatred, fear. We pledge whenever one person speaks ignorance bigotry, ten voices answer. They answer resoundingly offense insult, answering ignorance enlightenment, answering hatred understanding, answering darkness light; one person commits violent act name religion, millions stand condemn strength. In times like these, easy despair differences irreconcilable, mountains steep climb; therefore never reach level understanding peacefulness seek, I believe great religions world call us pursue. But that's I believe, I don't think it's believe either tonight. Part makes country special keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing future. We keep supporting next generation, believing young people keep us moving forward positive direction. So tonight I think it's important talk better tomorrow seek, also things — real, practical, tangible things — young people help shape better future.
