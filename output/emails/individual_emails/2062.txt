I London I'm participating interesting forum sponsored Princeton Project National Security Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) Transatlantic Program, I've received one email -- three -- prominent insider journalists policy hands Jim Jones' tenure National Security Adviser highly fragile. One emails reports starkly: Knives getting longer That's contact said. But emails intimated serious tone-deafness Jones role responsibilities, relationship President, relationship younger, dedicated, hardworking late-working staff. Jones recently said National Security Council staff members stayed longer 7:30 pm must disorganized work. I speak various NSC officials -- often 10:00 11:00 pm night. They hardworking, racing fast manage many, many, many major initiatives Barack Obama decided simultaneously pursue. James Jones considered admirers genius thinking management structures decision-making processes. On hand, critics see plodding, slow-moving, touch retired general better prepared think last era rather one moving into. His Â°critics think he's unable animate nimble, high flex policy decision making products White House manic dash get lot top tier issues dealt with. Friends National Security Council respect great deal way NSC Deputy Tom Donilon managing brief Many see picking load Jones seems unable unwilling carry. Donilon deeply engaged broad Middle East Iran portfolio, non-proliferation/WMD/arms control portfolio, China economic security portfolio, -- according reports -- supported helped cultivate relationship building State, DoD, NSC, parts national security bureaucracy. Some tell James Jones decided try remove "whack-a-mole" crisis reaction style decision-making could rob Obama administration chance define new course national security affairs. Tom Donilon, according reports, wields far hand power comes day day management responding crises require presidential attention response. Jones, contrast, obsessed structure decisions -- involved decisions, structure decision-making be, legal modifications process need made. He looks big nut needs cracked -- would improve, according Jim Jones, President's effectiveness chances success macro level. Jones' self-determined task high profile, mostly structural, won many admirers leadership -- necessary. If departs role, challenge dealing growing complexity national security threats vital need recalibrate policy making decision-making process require attention someone serious. So, whether Jones stays goes -- portfolio remain vital. But clear Jones enemies trying undermine place Obama orbit. Their motives may earnest concern tempo pace Jones' management style -- well could unwillingness allow liberal interventionists inside Obama administration fair share power Obama decision-making process. Jones structured views table approach decision making -- quite evident comes Middle East policy -- hawkish/neocon-friendly/Likudist-hugging part Obama administration's foreign policy operation may engaged coup attempt Jones. I don't know he'll survive latest effort oust -- folks need know "longer knives", whole, pure motives. -- Steve Clemons directs foreign policy programs New America Foundation publishes popular political blog, The Washington Note Shop Dell's full line Laptops starting $349!
