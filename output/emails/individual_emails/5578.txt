Thanks chat yesterday, Hillary. With Martin's Bruce Jones's help, I'm working one. Will get back you. On different matter—and that's I'm cc'ing Cheryl Jake—at point it's appropriate convenient, I'd welcome chance give you—either directly indirectly via C and/or J—a strongly held (and widely shared) view issue UN leadership timetable therefore. Zero rush. Hope it's genuine weekend (whatever means, grading curve). Strobe Strobe Talbott President, The Brookings Institution 1775 Massachusetts Avenue NW Washington, DC 20036 202.797.6200
