Whenever something big TV hear lots folks saying great. But time noticeably different. First, people across spectrum - DC insiders, reporters, staff, ex-staff, friends friends, WH folks, etc - blown away. Second, people REALLY moved last segment, three people even told teared up. I'm guessing hoping hear directly random folks coming days. And I think it's lousy couple weeks Admin, mixed messages bad news, coupled many people seeing first time extended period talking job relationship President, combo probably powerful reminder since speech Denver you're class (including President became enmeshed Gates incident) That didn't wait envoy question key, turned strength. What said President said it, one can't help think much team player remarkably you've adapted role. You definitely game. You either threw perfect game - least hitter. So couldn't gone better, achieved everything needed times 10, comes heels great 10 days. Will interesting see storyline emanates this. Because substantive news, it'll focus style especially saving Biden.
