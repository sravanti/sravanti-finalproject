Mourning martyr central Iranian Shiite religious culture strains medieval Catholicism Europe, Mousavi's camp tapping powerful set images myths here. The archetypal Shiite martyr Imam Husayn, grandson Prophet Muhammad, championed oppressed Muslims Iraq cut Umayyad Muslim Empire. Redognition Muslim state might commit ultimate sacrilege beheading person dangled Prophet's knee imbued modern political Shiism distrust state. When Husayn's head brought Umayyad caliph Yazid deposited throne, older companions Prophet said wept remarked, "I saw Prophet's lips cheeks." Shiites ritually march, flagellate, chant honor martyred Imam divinely-appointed leader. Today's protesters wearing green, symbolizes Mousavi's descent Prophet Muhammad.
