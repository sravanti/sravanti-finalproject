Sid 0 aptember 26, 2010 John Rentoul: The party voted David Miliband got Panda instead New Labour leader won't stand chance David Cameron The result worst possible Labour Party. A decisive victory Ed Miliband would one thing. The party would made wrong decision, would done eyes open leader's legitimacy unchallenged. Instead, Ed Miliband lost election two parts Labour's electoral college, among MPs among Labour Party members, won thanks 60-40 margin way among trade union members low turnout. If won clear margin I would said Labour chosen Panda leader. He soft, cuddly panders every oppositional instinct party. There position taken Labour government member prepared trash thought Labour members would like it. Tuition fees, Iraq, third runway Heathrow: name it, disowned it. Even, case third runway, policy direct ministerial responsibility. There part manifesto, wrote, prepared ditch. But party did. Labour Party members chose David Miliband. Labour MPs chose David. The party voted Ed Miliband tried dismiss "New Labour Establishment", words, supposedly hated Blairites. The party read signals voters correctly. It knows that, although didn't badly feared general election, lurch left answer. Party members MPs took board Tony Blair's warning Labour lost Gordon Brown "moved millimetre" left New Labour. They fall argument Labour better expected moving millimetre left and, therefore, better still needed move couple centimetres left. They think that, Labour pulled level opinion polls, next election bag. They know opposition party often moves ahead government opinion polls within months election. They also know Labour's poll rating artificially inflated absence fray Liberal Democrats protest party, know protest vote cannot relied upon general election. The Labour Party Labour MPs got right, election won operation run trade union machines. That means Ed Miliband, would struggled David Cameron House Commons event, going roasted every week. Every week, Prime Minister going point Leader Opposition support members benches behind him. Not that, support members party country. Every week, Cameron going portray Miliband place person trade union bosses beneficiary boss-politics stitch-up. If Ed Miliband won party members lost among MPs, I expected, Conservatives would teased Commons, would much legitimacy lain Duncan Smith - choice party activists wishes MPs. No wonder Ed "cork-popper" candidate Conservative HQ. The way things turned out, that's phrase; would worth lifting austerity ban bubbly for. David Cameron, lucky general, faces opponent less mandate IDS. Even Ed Miliband won comfortably three sections Labour's electoral college, I feel would struggled Cameron. This way, I fear fights hands tied behind back.
