sbwhoeop Monday, November 2, 2009 6:23 PM H FYI: When chance, re: Wm. Hague told you, relevant undercurrent EU debate. Sid FrsOrn The Times November 3, 2009 I suggest night theatre, Mr Cameron A sop party's Europhobes left Conservative leader defending indefensible. He ashamed David Aaronovitch On Friday morning David Cameron called upon David Miliband apologise. On Friday evening I went see play. The play Our Class, Polish playwright, Tadeusz Slobodzianek. In series short "chapters" Slobodzianek followed group classmates small Polish village 1925 2002. Like village, class half Catholic half Jewish. In 1941, Germans replaced Russians occupiers, almost Jews area murdered single day. Slobodzianek shows led massacre happened afterwards. It unbearable. Though village named play, based real events took place Jedwabne July 10, 1941. As Poland's Institute National Memory concluded 2002, day 40-50 Jewish men forced parade around town singing songs, led barn outskirts where, one one, killed knives, axes cleavers thrown pit. Then 300 women children led town square barn locked inside. Kerosene poured roof walls set alight. The screams could heard two kilometres away; one survived. In 2001 finally acknowledged many people known along. The murderers hadn't Germans, local Poles, depicted Our Class. Alexander Kwasniewski, Polish President, apologised dead Jews survivors ceremony Jedwabne "in name, name Poles whose conscience shattered crime". History matters. Few believe much Law Justice party Michel Kaminski, leads Tory-backed group European Parliament. The party's leaders demanded apologies Russians massacre 21,000 Polish officers Katyn 1940 references terrible Polish historical suffering constituted big part, political appeal. But despite historical sensitivity Mr Kaminski, MEP Jedwabne area, support 2001 apology. He opposed vigorously, associating "Committee Defend .Good Name Jedwabne". Among leading members local priest, Edward Orlowski, — asked journalists whether would attending ceremony President apologised — said: "These lies. business. Germans responsible, apologiSe?" Mr Kaminski developed slightly different rationale. As told interviewer far-right newspaper, Our Poland, murders — abhorred — work outcasts, would apologise someone "from Jewish side" apologised "the Jews" behaved Soviet occupation 1939 1941. Last month Mr Kaminski (who denied giving interview) confirmed position. "If asking Polish nation apologise crime made Jedwabne," said, "you would require whole Jewish nation apologise Jewish communists Eastern Poland." It argument incenses me,•as would anyone, I think, sat Our Class. The idea collective Jewish Bolshevism major anti-Semitic trope war; major element self-justification it. Mr Kaminski denied apology, denied need it, equated massacre "Jewish actions" allied denied massacre altogether, fulfilling historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet's observation patterns massacre denial: "it never happened, happened justified, themselves, us." Mr Kaminski's view described disgraceful Mr Miiiband. Having read enormous amount Jedwabne last weeks, I think Mr Miliband completely right — disgraceful. And might well demand Mr Cameron: "I apologise?" But that, I find amazed Mr Cameron ever came position demanding foreign secretary, descended Polish Jews, apologise possibly offending sensibilities foreign politician vehemently opposed apology massacre Polish Jews. I think things Mr Cameron got right leadership the. Conservatve Party mental jaw drops sheer wrongness it. Now Tory columnists, bioggers activists devoting time nitpicking sophistry nature collective guilt, attacking non-existent "smears" say attached unlovely person Mr Kaminski. Why? It true, embattled Conservatives argued, many grand European coalitions contain people whose history problematic. There odds sods big conservative grouping, EPP, socialist group. But personalities far outweighed parties IVIerkels Sarkozys. The Polish member EPP, example, ruling free-market, non-nationalist conservative party Donald Tusk — almost certainly party Mr Cameron would join Pole. The new Tory grouping, European Conservatives Reformists, contrast, odds sods continental Cameron would certainly shun, bar one organisation — British Conservatives. So get position explain Latvian SS wasn't bad really, Mr Kaminski understandable position collective guilt? And answer seems Mr Cameron promised Europhobes leadership campaign back 2005 would leave "federalist" EPP, logical outcome move weird alliance finds defending. Was necessary? No. Was Britain's interests? Absolutely not. interests progressive Conservatism? You must joking. So happened Mr Cameron doesn't really care enough Europe think consequences lightly given promises, he's much Euro-nutter sects, Hannanites, Cashists Redwoodians? This kind advice I loathe, I'll say anyway. Go see Our Class, Mr C. This one hole don't want keep digging.
