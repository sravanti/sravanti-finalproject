It's quite possibly best thing written SecState. We're getting around friends & family, along People op-ed NYT Mag q&a - great weekend terms positive press. It's 3 a.m. Do You Know Where Hillary Clinton Is? By David Rothkopf Washington Post Sunday, August 23, 2009 When comes Hillary Rodham Clinton, we're missing forest pantsuits. Clinton first celebrity become nation's top diplomat -- honor goes distant predecessor, Thomas Jefferson, time took office one famous gossiped-about men America -- may biggest. And first seven months office, former first lady, erstwhile presidential candidate eternal lightning rod drawn attention moods, looks, outtakes (of course) relationship husband for, well, work revamping nation's foreign policy. Even venerable publications -- one I regularly contribute, Foreign Policy -- woven all- Hillary-all-the-time coverage odd discussions Clinton's handbag scarf choices. Daily Beast editor Tina Brown, depicting Clinton supporter, scathing small-minded discussing things Clinton's weight hair, "defense" Hillary essay "Obama's Other Wife" sexist title suggests. Indeed, sexism followed Clinton campaign trail Foggy Bottom, seen recently posturing outrage surrounding exchange Congo Clinton reacted understandable frustration now-infamous question regarding husband's views. Major media outlets joined gossipfest, whether New York Times, covered Clinton's first big policy speech discussing whether White House, The Washington Post, couple reporters mused whether brew called Mad Bitch would beer choice secretary state. Amid distractions, Clinton actually doing? Only overseeing may profound changes U.S. foreign policy two decades -- transformation may render presidencies Bill Clinton George W. Bush mere side notes long transition meaningful post-Cold War worldview. The secretary quietly begun rethinking nature diplomacy translating vision revitalized State Department, one approaches U.S. allies rivals ways challenge long-held traditions. And despite pessimists invoked "team rivals" cliche predict President Obama Clinton would get along, Hillary defined role Obamaverse: often bad cop good cop, spine stiffener comes tough adversaries nurturer new strategies. Recognizing 3 a.m. phone calls going White House, instead tackling tough questions that, since end Cold War, kept America's leaders awake night. In early days new administration, easy focus Clinton achieved ways power supposedly constrained. Indeed, efforts frustrated difficult personnel approvals disputes White House get jobs. But way administrations. More unusual avidity new president seized reins foreign policy -- assertively either George W. Bush Bill Clinton him. Obama's centrality amplifies importance closest White House staffers, penchant appointing special envoys Richard Holbrooke (on Afghanistan Pakistan) George Mitchell (on Middle East) interpreted limiting Clinton's role. Given challenges involved, perhaps natural White House would bigger day-to-day hand nation's urgent foreign policy issues. But Obama, national security adviser Jim Jones, Vice President Joe Biden Secretary Defense Robert Gates absorbed Iraq, Afghanistan inherited problems recent past, Clinton's State Department take bigger role tackling problems future -- particular, America lead world century ahead. This approach necessary canny: It recognizes U.S. policy must change fulfill Obama's vision many high-profile issues Middle East often swamped careers aspirations secretaries state past. Which nations key partners? What many vital partners -- China, example, Russia -- rivals well? How must America's alliances change NATO stretched limit? How engage rogue states old enemies ways strengthen preserve prerogative challenge threats? How move beyond diplomacy men striped pants speaking governments embrace potent nonstate players once-disenfranchised peoples? In searching answers, Clinton leaving behind old doctrines labels. She outlined new thinking recent speech Council Foreign Relations New York, revealed stark differences new administration's worldview predecessors: The recurring themes include "partnership" "engagement" "common interests." Clearly, Madeleine Albright's "indispensable nation" recognized indispensability collaborating others. Who "others" area change greatest rapid. "We put," Clinton said, "special emphasis encouraging major emerging global powers -- China, India, Russia Brazil, well Turkey, Indonesia South Africa -- full partners tackling global agenda." This death knell G-8 head table global community; administration effort underway determine whether successor G-8 G-20, perhaps grouping. Though move away G-8 began waning days Bush era, administration viewed world different lens, perception evolved traditional great-power view pre-Galilean notion everything revolved around world's sole superpower. Obama Clinton made engaging emerging powers priority. Obama visited Russia earlier year host Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh first state dinner November. Clinton made trips China India, would Obama Russia injured elbow. Both visited Africa Middle East, reaching women Islamic world. On many critical agenda items -- rollback nuclear weapons climate trade talks -- emerging powers essential achieving U.S. goals. As result, we've seen new American willingness play old differences, whether Russia missile shield or, Clinton showed China trip, Beijing human rights. At center Clinton's brain trust Anne-Marie Slaughter, former dean Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School Public International Affairs. Now head policy planning State Department, Slaughter elaborated ideas Clinton's speech. "We envision getting new group states around table, also building networks, coalitions partnerships states nonstate actors tackle specific problems," told me. "To that," Slaughter continued, "our diplomats going need skills closer community organizing traditional reporting analysis. New connecting technologies vital tools kind diplomacy." A new team brought make changes real. Clinton recruited Alec Ross, one leaders Obama's technology policy team, seventh floor State Department senior adviser innovation. His mission harness new information tools advance U.S. interests -- task made easier Internet mobile networks played starring roles recent incidents, Iran Uighur uprising western China Moldova. Whether telecommunications program Congo protect women violence text messaging raise money Pakistani refugees Swat Valley, technology deployed reach new audiences. Of course, need new ideas revitalize State Department; need resources, too. The secretary brought former Bill Clinton-era budget chief Jack Lew help claw back money statecraft many Foggy Bottom feel sucked toward Pentagon. She also created special positions back new priorities, Melanne Verveer ambassador large women's issues, Elizabeth Bagley handle public-private outreach worldwide Todd Stern chief negotiator climate. Even months in, it's clear appointments far window dressing. Lew, Slaughter acting head U.S. Agency International Development leading effort rethink foreign aid new Quadrennial Diplomacy Development Review, initiative modeled Pentagon's strategic assessments designed review State's priorities. Stern conducted high-level discussions climate change around world, notably China. Clinton made women's issues centerpiece recent 11-day trip Africa, stressed "the social, political economic marginalization women across Africa left void continent undermines progress prosperity." Clinton also signaled importance private-sector experience naming former Goldman Sachs International vice chairman Robert Hormats, respected veteran four administrations, handle economic issues State Department, well Judith McHale, former chief executive Discovery Communications, run public diplomacy. In vein, opened Cuba American telecommunications companies reached India's private sector energy cooperation -- showing administration seek advance national interests tapping self-interests business community. As new administration, inevitable problems. The old campaign teams -- Clinton's Obama's -- still eye warily, feeling gradually fading. And accounts, administration's national security team come together successfully, Clinton developing strong relationships national security adviser Jones Defense Secretary Gates. Her policy deputy, Jim Steinberg, renewed old collaboration deputy national security adviser Tom Donilon; two them, working Obama campaign foreign policy advisers Denis McDonough Mark Lippert, formed one State Department seventh-floor dweller called "a powerful quartet heart real interagency policymaking." Henry Kissinger may overstated matters said best White House-State relationship recent memory, it's bad, State-Pentagon relationship best shape decades. At heart things, though, relationship Clinton Obama. For administration's talk international partnerships, may critical partnership all. So far, according multiple high-level officials State White House, two seem aligned views. In addition, gradually defining complementary roles. Obama assumed role principal spokesperson foreign policy, international audiences welcome new improved American brand. Clinton thus far echoed points also delivered tougher ones. Whether missile shield Iran North Korean saber-rattling, continued imprisonment Aung San Suu Kyi Burma rape corruption Congo, secretary state spoken bluntly world stage -- even triggered snide comments North Korea. It still early, president's foreign policy legacy often defined less big principles one reacts unexpected, whether missiles Cuba terrorism New York. Promising ideas fail limited attention reluctant bureaucracies, rhetoric eventually rings hollow, self-congratulatory "smart power" already me. Nevertheless, evidence that, seven months job, Obama's unlikely secretary state supporting augmenting agenda effectively. Not Obama's "other wife," Bill Clinton's wife, even celebrity former presidential candidate -- new role making.
