Cheryl Mills < Sunday, December 6, 2009 9:39 PM Fwd: Charles Blow NYT today EF1 December 5, 2009 Op-Ed Columnist Black Age Obama By CHARLES M. BLOW A hundred fifty years ago, Charles Dickens opened "A Tale Two Cities" now-famous phrase: "It best times, worst times. ..." Those words resonated recently contemplating impact Obama presidency blacks America. So far, it's mixed. Blacks living tale two Americas â€” one ascension first black president cultural capital accrues; collapsing quality life amplified racial tensions, supporting president loath even acknowledge pain, let alone commiserate it. Last year, blacks dared dream anew, envisioning future Obama's election would catalyst era prosperity racial harmony. Now election's afterglow nearly faded, hysteria hope ground hard stone reality. Things gotten better. In many ways, they've gotten worse. The recession, one, dealt particularly punishing uneven hand blacks. A May report Pew Research Center found blacks likely get higher-priced subprime loans, leading higher foreclosure rates. In fact, blacks displaced Hispanics group lowest homeownership rates. According recent jobs data, unemployment rate blacks nearly twice whites, gap important demographics widened rapidly since Obama took office. The unemployment rate time white college graduates 24 years old grew 20 percent. For black cohorts, rate grew twice much. And report published last month Department Agriculture found 2008, "food insecurity" American households risen record levels, black children likely experience food insecurity. Things racial front bad. We inundated examples overt racism scale unaccustomed. Any protester racist poster hijack news cycle, racist image live forever Internet. In fact, racially offensive images first couple prolific online Google runs apologetic ad results image searches them. And it's words images; it's actions well. According Federal Bureau Investigation's 2008 hate crimes data released last week, anti-black hate crimes rose 4 percent 2007, combined hate crimes racial categories declined 11 percent. If look two-year trend, would include Obarna's ascension candidate, anti-black hate crimes risen 8 percent, racial groups fallen 19 percent. This sobering effect blacks. According Nov. 9 report Gallup, last summer 23 percent blacks thought race relations would get lot better election Obama. Now less half percentage says things actually gotten lot better. The racial animosity Obama's election stirred may contributed rallying effect among blacks. According Gallup report published Nov. 24, Obama's approval rating among whites dropped 39 percent, among blacks remains 90 percent. Also, hasn't exactly good year black men news. Plaxico Burress locked accidentally shooting gun club. Henry Louis Gates Jr. locked intentionally shooting mouth home. And Michael Jackson died shot full propofol. Chris Brown brutally beat Rihanna. Former Representative William Jefferson convicted. And recently, "personal failings" Tiger Woods portray alley cat. Meanwhile, critically acclaimed black movie year, "Precious," features black man rapes twice impregnates daughter. Rooting president feels like nice counterbalance. However, rallying creates conundrum blacks: air anxiety without arming Obama's enemies. This dilemma rendered blacks virtually voiceless pressing issues time voices would presumably held greater sway. This means Obama get away almost nothing specifically address issues important African-Americans instead focus white voters he's losing droves. This gone unnoticed. In Nov. 9 Gallup poll, number blacks felt Obama would go far enough promoting efforts aid black community jumped 60 percent last summer now. The hard truth Obama needs white voters needs black ones. According analysis, even every black person America stayed home Election Day, Obama would still president. To large degree, Obama elected white people, able accept consciously portrayed racially ambiguous. In fact, commiserating blacks could prove politically problematic. In study published journal Proceedings National Academy Sciences month, researchers asked subjects rate images president determine ones best represented "true essence." In photos, skin lightened. In others, darkened. The result? The people identified "whiter" images, likely voted him, vice versa. The Age Obama, far least, seems less Obama black community game-changer White House gamesman. It's unclear positive Obama Effect, Obama Backlash increasingly apparent. Meanwhile, black people also living tale two actions: grin bear it. Forwarded message
