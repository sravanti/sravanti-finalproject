Sid Financial Times FT.com OMMENT editorial US fumbling new China tone Published: November 16 2009 20:39 I Last updated: November 16 2009 20:39 Gone days US president could visit Beijing unassailable top dog, able lecture Chinese everything human rights overvalued currency. As become fashionable note, events instead obliged Barack Obama play role washed-up debtor visiting stern bank manager yet another loan. That analogy useful. But overdone. Certainly, financial crisis brought sharp relief dependent US become foreign creditors, chief among China. It also sharpened perception happening anyway, relative decline US-centric west relative rise China-centric Asia. But word relative important. China, poor riddled internal contradictions, yet, long way. The changing relationship China demand new tone. But early indications Mr Obama still fumbling right one. Take global imbalances. In set-piece speech Asian tour — delivered Japan, perhaps assure hosts Washington abandoning Tokyo yet — Mr Obama correctly pointed global economy cannot go back business usual. "One important lessons recession taught us limits depending primarily American consumers Asian exports drive growth," said. That quite right. But entreaties global rebalancing fall flat China. That partly Beijing remains publicly sceptical US's long-term finances. From China's perspective, Mr Obama's emergency measures stimulate US economy persuade Americans spend way recession smack re-creating spendthrift ways triggered crisis first place. That explains Chinese officials quizzed US counterparts robustly intend pay healthcare reform. It also Beijing started questioning US monetary, well fiscal, policy. On eve US president's visit, Liu Mingkang, China's chief banking regulator, took swipe US Federal Reserve, saying combination weak dollar low interest rates risked generating global asset bubble. That bit rich coming someone oversees banking system pumped equivalent nearly 30 per cent gross domestic product economy far year. But reflects new tone China presumes address humbled superpower. Mr Obama's efforts occupy moral high ground also undermined flirtation protectionism, particularly decision slap tariffs Chinese tyres. His administration failed spell convincing trade policy — seen stark omission for-a business- oriented Asian audience. Such perceived deficiencies hobbled ability cajole China real conviction. When comes human rights, too, US seems drawn conclusion good policy badmouth chief creditor. Hillary Clinton, secretary state, set tone early said human rights "interfere" matters implicitly greater urgency. Mr Obama obligingly omitted references Tibet, Xinjiang even Taiwan Tokyo speech. There also single mention India, potential regional counterweight China, yet another indication Washington behaving though treading eggshells. It therefore refreshing hear Mr Obama criticise Chinese censorship town hall meeting Shanghai Monday — though even could undo self-censorship refusing meet Dalai Lama week's trip. It right proper US acknowledge rising significance China. Mr Obama's assurances China's rise need threat spot on. But token, US accommodation taken far. Contrary common perception, China's huge holdings US treasuries sign great strength. They evidence dependent Chinese growth US consumer. Equally, idea China, economy less third size US GDP per capita roughly Angola's, somehow save world ludicrous. Mr Obama right show respect China. He need — must — kowtow.
