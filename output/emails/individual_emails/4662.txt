Sid In light Clegg's rising popularity partly based anti-Americanism Germany's growing hegemony Europe becoming insular, John Kornblum written op-ed reference last graphs US policy. 7.71 April 23, 2010 I.H.T. Op-Ed Contributor Germany Need Dream By JOHN KORNBLUM Has Germany abandoned Europe? Do Angela Merkel's tough conditions aid Greece mean Germany longer motor European integration? Has Frau Merkel fact morphed Miss Europa 2007 Fraulein Germania 2010, Germany's former foreign minister Joschka Fischer suggested? As former American ambassador lived arid worked better part four decades around Germany, Blackberry often glows red hot messages persons asking questions. My response always same: Germany changed little, Europe world changed lot. Therein lies dilemma. Germany worked hard dig way disaster 1945, trauma remains defining issue German society. Sixty five years later, Germany still focused three essentials recovery: stability, respectability peace. Keep triangle mind lots things quickly come focus. From first days Federal Republic. Germany's leaders emphasized importance defining interests solely within common European Atlantic vocation. But also understood renouncing national ambitions remove responsibility pursue specific German goals common institutions. Many important postwar accomplishments conceived pushed Germany, sometimes opposition others — including United States. Ostpolitik controversial years, NATO enlargement. Germany pushed determination. Helmut Kohl consult promulgating 10 points reunification. He agreed French desires common currency, could mirror Deutsche mark, decades European monetary standard. The euro stability pact, object much controversy Greece, result. After 1990, E.U.'s eastward expansion Germany's way firming Eastern flank. Slowly without fanfare, Germany remaking European Union image. At step way, Germany made wishes palatable paying share. Part today's misunderstanding caused Germany's success using contributions build image selflessness. Germany single-minded pursuit goals Charles de Gaulle ever his, almost always left leadership others. A new consciousness grew costs reunification began mount. "Europe" institutional sense become increasingly unpopular. German courts begun define German European issues context German Constitution rather basis E.U. law. At least Ms. Merkel's refusal allow immediate assistance Greece based fears would fan anti-E.U. sentiment home. Are first signs German Tea Party? Here find source hand wringing Germany's role "motor Europe." Ms. Merkel's unwillingness sweeten financial pot echoed throughout Brussels. To many, signified decline German willingness "salute French flag three times raising German flag," Konrad Adenauer used put it. Germans alone objecting throwing money E.U. pot, happen ones something it. Many fear without German complaisance, E.U. stutter stop. But self- denial could never offer viable foundation new Europe. Neither could inefficiency even corruption characterizes many E.U. programs. Most maddening thinking Europeans knowledge Germans right. But them, question whether Germany remaking E.U. fashion palatable majority member states. They sure focus stability accountability right way help diverse collection peoples adjust globalized world. And Angela Merkel raps Greek knuckles, sending message Europeans don't want hear. Not Germany dangerous; even worse, unrelenting. The Neue aricher Zeitung probably spoke many others accused Germany wanting Europe become large Switzerland. The growing gap Germany's aspirations perceived needs members E.U. beginning burden sides. Most Europeans simply ready live German standards. Without flexible sense common purpose, project build democratic Europe could stop dead water. But Germans often tell you: They forgotten dream. Younger Germans feel lack inspiration well. Dreams 200,000 waiting hear rallied hear Barack Obama Berlin two summers ago. They wanted "Dare Hope," characteristically timid German translation title president's best seller. And still waiting. America seems busy elsewhere. The main conclusion I draw debate Germany Germany all. The task building democratic Europe far complete. Most foundations laid residents starting haggle design. Weaving today's 27 states true trans-Atlantic partnership task big Germany even Europe accomplish alone. They desperately need skilled architectural assistance. Uniting Europe North America audacious project ever conceived. If works, United States joined nearly 500 million Europeans form democratic space, within modern democratic values harness energy single nation earth. Democracy's future operating system globalized world assured. European fecklessness seems worry Washington officials days. But Germany forgotten dream United States busy try, guilty perpetuating aimlessness criticize. To hold side bargain, Europe needs exactly Barack Obama originally promised — audacity hope.
