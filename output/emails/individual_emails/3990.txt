sbwhoeop Tuesday, February 16, 2010 8:40 AM H: FYI: Les Gelb. S Replace Rahm Leslie H. Gelb February 15, 2010 I 10:48pm I ....7IKristoffer Tripplaar / SPA President Obama desperately needs sweeping staff shakeup save presidency. Leslie H. Gelb must reassign Rahm, dump Larry Summers, get rid National Security adviser Jim Jones. The negative, even dismissive, talk Obama White House reached critical point. The president must change key personnel now. Unless speedily sets new team, reduced speechmaker. It's mostly matter relocating Chicago campaign crowd surround Oval Office inserting people proven records getting things done Washington world. To fair, it's clear whether bad judgments priorities, practicalities, steadiness come Mr. Obama White House team. Maybe overpowers discussions, maybe gives role policymaking far beyond experience realm. Unless you're there, don't know. But Mr. Obama president, except right-wing crazies, Americans still recognize great talents promise. It who's got helped. So who've got go. It who's got helped. So who've got go. One may quarrel sense urgency here. But it's hard conversation opinion leaders anywhere—and especially Washington—that doesn't descend ripping Obama's White House team. The refrain complaints always same: • Obama forever taking strong stances backfill trim. Most recently, said "begrudge" Wall Streeters big earnings part market system. This, face saying couple weeks ago big bonuses "shameful." • Obama doesn't know what's really going on. Regarding Middle East, recently said "I think absolutely true year didn't produce kind breakthrough wanted, anticipated political problems sides earlier, might raised expectations high." He totally realize Palestinians Israelis nowhere close sitting dealing. • Obama wants get along everyone badly doesn't recognize real opposition sees it—let alone know deal it. He emerges meeting congressional Republican leaders health-care reform says "an eternal optimist—when Republican leaders told press don't see common ground believe administration "scrap bill start over." • It's even hard follow latest Afghan policy. He calls Afghanistan "war necessity" orders 30,000 new troops there, coupled announcement he'll begin withdrawing year plus, see advisers say start withdrawals say won't. I've scribbled similar points recent months The Daily Beast. And last week The Financial Times, Edward Luce provided thunderclap Washington's negative consensus incompetence Obarna's Chicago-laden team. Luce named names White House, number journalists bloggers strikingly failed link Luce story. They said fear wrath Chicagoans. Steve Clemons, author The Washington Note, essentially eridorse.d Luce finding slapped fellow bloggers' wrists hiding issue. The situation serious Carter administration. There, two capable political campaigners--Hamilton Jordan Jody Powell—moved critical White House positions without knowing much business Washington. And were, quite naturally, busy learn. They also added "them" versus "us" (Washington insiders bureaucrats versus regular guys Georgia) mentality plagues administrations. The Chicagoans others "guarding" president create "us versus them" world. It's hard imagine policy conversation president Chicago crowd, since none them, except Rahm Emanuel, Washington policy experience. And isn't much evidence bring strong-minded outsiders challenge president regular basis either. The result inexperienced president advised inexperienced team. Here personnel changes bruited political policy circles: First, remove Rahm Emanuel chief staff move senior political adviser slot. No one I've talked believes management skills discipline run White House. But terrific political mind fighter given new job time thing. Proven pros could step right include following: Erskine Bowles, president University North Carolina former Clinton chief staff; Leon Panetta, CIA director formerly White House chief well Clinton; Sylvia Mathews, former deputy chief staff also Clinton; John Podesta, another former Clinton chief heads Center American Progress. All four tough know manage. Replace Lawrence Summers, director White House's National Economic Council, Paul Volcker, former chairman Federal Reserve. Summers brilliant highly controversial; he's beaten said want anyway. Volcker unmatched stature, practical experience, courage lion. He one position get step-by-step brass tacks economy stop Mr. Obama's weekly gyrations. Others proven track records help inside outside advisers are: Stephen Robert, formerly head Oppenheimer, Vincent Mai, former leader AEA Investors, Tom Hill Blackstone. There also two economic stars Washington who'd improve policymaking public combat: Sheila Bair, chairwoman Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Elizabeth Warren, chair Congressional Oversight Panel. One outside adviser would help president see economic hard choices ahead: Peter G. Peterson, accomplished businessman policy head. David Axelrod, senior political adviser president, needs concentrate next presidential campaign, wherein expertise lies, domestic foreign policy, another smart unknowledgeable voice. Good replacements know politics Washington would aforementioned Podesta; Tom Deschle, former Democratic Senate Majority Leader. As David Plouffe, another senior campaign aide, unofficial residence White House, lodged nearby Executive Office Building. Senior adviser Chicago buddy Valerie Jarrett much part inner circle move, given limited role making policy. Mr. Obama's crowd appears think getting things done means giving another speech. It's nice, nearly enough. Robert Gibbs needs rest press secretary. Let's put way: He wasn't born daily jousts pithy Republicans. His job calls memorable pointed phrases attacks, circle-the-wagon circumlocutions. Possible successors? Try Doyle McManus L.A. Times, Jake Tapper ABC News, Helene Cooper The New York Times. Last least, James Jones, National Security Adviser, move on. The career Marine greatly admired respected Commandant Corps NATO's military chief. He handled duties great skill. But wide acclamation inside outside White House, emerged strategist—perhaps key requirement key position. The person job pull everything together—laying achievable objectives precise plans dispense carefully packaged carrots sticks. One Democrat could step now, despite age, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's national-security adviser. He first-rate strategic mind—a rare quality—and knows deliver results. Obama need iron Zbig's lack sympathy toward Israel Russia. Also available boatload first-class retired diplomats judgment background needed perform National Security Council job effectively. They would greeted applause home abroad. Try former ambassadors Thomas Pickering, Morton Abramowitz, Frank Wisner, Reginald Bartholomew, Winston Lord. They all. At minimum, others like form core group meets regularly Obama strategy. Yes, many pros suggested reached golden years. But 70 even 80 new 60. They possess necessary energy, experience rare skill delivering results. They also shovel-ready. As critical bonus, could would mentor next generation down, talented one indeed, succeed two three years. To lead America world, Obama grow far beyond present propensity treat problems intellectual puzzles—to collect facts hear arguments. The great tasks governing demand proven intuition sensing what's achievable, buttons push when, buy time power take hold, make adjustments without flagrantly foolish rhetoric, avoid failures diminish power, succeed small well large ways. With team versed arts skills, President Obama America would succeed. Leslie H. Gelb, former New York Times columnist senior government official, author powerRule,5-.
