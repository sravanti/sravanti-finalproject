I making FM calls re Afghanistan going well memcons describe specific responses followup, especially Athens Brussels. Below memo concerned observer British feeling alienated us. /Let know think. Thx. Consensus across board Britain—center, right, left—is Atlantic alliance—the special relationship—the historic bond since World War II—is shattered. There dissenting voice, one, illusions. Opinion unanimous. The bottom line Obama administration's denigration UK seen summation Bush era. Undoubtedly, saw week Minister Defense Bob Ainsworth's public criticism Obama's indecision accusation president indifferent damaging British interest. While Downing Street sought ameliorate remarks oleaginous statement view simply everyone—everyone—thinks. His clumsy outburst classic gaffe—an embarrassing mistake reveals something true. The Chilcot inquiry Parliament, publicly conducting hearings origins UK involvement Iraq invasion, put Bush's war terror—and British involvement—on trial—and calmly conducted eviscerating hearings go another year. Blair seen either complicit basis knowing casus belli enthusiastically deceived tool. Nick Clegg, leader Liberal Democrats, stated reason support Afghanistan mission cratered lies told run-up Iraq war—another view universally held. Meanwhile, former UK ambassador US Christopher Meyer published new book history UK diplomacy concluding sections demise special relationship. He interviewed British media also appeared voluble witness Chi!cot commission. All British newspapers journals prominently published many pieces within last week decline fall US-UK relationship. Please see lead editorial today London Times cover story Spectator—two resolutely pro-American sources. The tone resentful, reserved, disdainful superior. The US administration considered blinkered, parochial counter-productive. Conservatives contemptuous Labour, feels abandoned somewhat baffled. Rather eager Obama's poodle, Cameron would superficially friendly privately scornful. Class lot contempt. A Cameron government would aristocratic even narrowly Etonian Conservative government recent history, sharply contrasting especially striving classless perspective grocer's daughter, Margaret Thatcher. And yet, recent poll week showed Labour within striking distance Tories, five points down, result slight economic uptick. A hung parliament seems possible. Given distribution voting patterns, Labour need win plurality seats Tories. The slight buoyancy Labour unique situation heightened anxiety Obama's Afghanistan process, excluded British government significant consultation consideration interests. See lead Con Coughlin's Spectator piece. Therefore, President might contemplate brief stop London going coming Oslo meeting Copenhage make public appearance Brown. And, others Administration pay special attention Brown secure strong support him, importantly, whole government British establishment reassured value stalwart support despite ups downs last eight years. Pasted Times editorial link Spectator article. From The Times November 26, 2009 Atlantic drift Washington's delay announcing Afghanistan strategy left Brown drifting. Obama needs invest time attention transatlantic alliance President Obama declared Tuesday "the whole world" responsibility help US-led mission Afghanistan. He would, said; soon lay "obligations international partners". Those partners waiting long time details. On Monday President tenth meeting advisers work strategy Afghanistan. He spent almost three months considering options, promised announcement deployments Thanksgiving holiday. For Gordon Brown, cannot come soon. After United States, Britain largest contributor troops Nato operation Afghanistan. There never suggestion Britain enough soldiers pursue separate strategy operate independently US forces, already number 68,000 troops. Until White House decides whether send extra 40,000 figure significantly lower number requested General Stanley McChrystal, Mr Brown cannot properly plan best support strategy. It becoming sadly apparent Britain left drifting delays Washington, Obama Administration largely unaware embarrassment causing Government. More worryingly, seem source concern within Administration. Downing Street, diplomatically, turns aside suggestion frustrated nonchalance treated. But insistent questions Afghanistan, anger caused steady stream returning war dead rapid crumbling public support war cannot answered effectively Mr Brown taken American confidence seen full partner Nato campaign. On surface, continuing high regard Britain dynamic articulate new President masked growling complaints. Mr Brown suffering, predecessor did, taint close association deeply unpopular US president. On contrary: like several European leaders, still eager position close possible Mr Obama clothe President's European popularity. But within Government, already worry Britain's voice counts far less past. This simply another instance persistent pointless British anxiety so-called special relationship; justified concern two main pillars Nato alliance policies strategies closely co-ordinated sympathetically understood sides fighting war. The fault, glaringly, American side. The White House longer seems monitoring reactions political options transatlantic allies. It sufficient suggest Administration sees little point investing time diplomacy British government likely defeated coming general election; wartime allies interests go far beyond political make-up government day. Mr Obama promised election campaign revive trust American leadership re-engage multinational diplomacy. In office, certainly voiced ideals; invested little giving new substance dynamism transatlantic relationship. On Afghanistan, Mr Brown sometimes left speechless Washington. He talks sending 500 extra troops. But knows likely US strategy, cannot outline own. Atlanticism always fragile Left stretched breaking point Tony Blair. It undermined indifference Washington.
