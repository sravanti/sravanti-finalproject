Have seen story? I look forward discussing. Gates Says U.S. Lacks Strategy Curb Iran's Nuclear Drive By DAVID E. SANGER THOM SHANKER Published: April 18, 2010 WASHINGTON - Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates warned secret three-page memorandum top White House officials United States effective long-range policy dealing Iran's steady progress toward nuclear capability, according government officials familiar document. Several officials said highly classified analysis, written January President Obama's national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, touched intense effort inside Pentagon, White House intelligence agencies develop new options Mr. Obama. They include revised set military alternatives, still development, considered diplomacy sanctions fail force Iran change course. Officials familiar memo's contents would describe portions dealing strategy policy, sections apparently dealt secret operations Iran, deal Persian Gulf allies. One senior official, like others spoke condition anonymity sensitive nature memo, described document "a wake-up call." But White House officials dispute view, insisting 15 months conducting detailed planning many possible outcomes regarding Iran's nuclear program. In interview Friday, General Jones declined speak memorandum. But said: "On Iran, said going do. The fact don't announce publicly entire strategy world see doesn't mean don't strategy anticipates full range contingencies - do." But memo, Mr. Gates wrote variety concerns, including absence effective strategy Iran choose course many government outside analysts consider likely: Iran could assemble major parts needs nuclear weapon - fuel, designs detonators - stop short assembling fully operational weapon. In case, Iran could remain signatory Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty becoming strategists call "virtual" nuclear weapons state. According several officials, memorandum also calls new thinking United States might contain Iran's power decided produce weapon, deal possibility fuel weapons could obtained one terrorist groups Iran supported, officials said considered less-likely possibility. Mr. Gates never mentioned memo public. His spokesman, Geoff Morrell, declined comment specifics document, issued statement Saturday saying, "The secretary believes president national security team spent extraordinary amount time effort considering preparing full range contingencies respect Iran." Pressed administration's ambiguous phrases close United States willing allow. Iran's program proceed, senior administration official described last week somewhat clearer terms line Iran would permitted cross. The official said United States would ensure Iran would "acquire nuclear capability," step Tehran could get well developed sophisticated weapon. "That includes ability breakout," said, using term nuclear specialists apply country suddenly renounces nonproliferation treaty uses technology build small arsenal. Nearly two weeks ago, Mr. Obama, interview The New York Times, asked whether saw difference nuclear-capable Iran one fully developed weapon. "I'm going parse right now," said. But noted North Korea considered nuclear-capable state threw inspectors and, said, "became self-professed nuclear state." Mr. Gates alluded concern intelligence agencies might miss signals Iran taking final steps toward producing weapon. Last Sunday NBC News program "Meet Press," said: "If policy go threshold assemble nuclear weapon, tell assembled? I don't actually know would verify that." But cautioned Iran run production difficulties, said, "It's going slow - slower anticipated, moving direction." Mr. Gates taken crucial role formulating administration's strategy, known career issue stark warnings possibility strategic surprise. Some officials said memo viewed light: warning relatively new president United States adequately prepared. He wrote memo Iran let pass 2009 deadline set Mr. Obama respond offers diplomatic engagement. Both process efforts bring new sanctions Iran struggled. Administration officials hoped revelation Mr. Obama September Iran building new uranium enrichment plant inside mountain near Qum would galvanize nations Iran, reaction muted. The next three months spent proved fruitless diplomatic talks Iran plan swap much low-enriched uranium fuel medical reactor Tehran. By time Mr. Gates wrote memo, negotiations collapsed. Mr. Gates's memo appears reflect concerns upper echelons Pentagon military White House well-prepared series alternatives place case diplomatic steps finally failed. In fact, Mr. Gates issued warning, chairman Joint Chiefs Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, wrote official "chairman's guidance" staff saying military option would "limited results" Iran's nuclear facilities, preparations needed stepped up. "Should president call military options, must ready," admiral wrote. Administration officials testifying Senate committee last week made clear preparations way. So General Jones. "The president made clear beginning administration need prepared every possible contingency," said interview. "That done day one, successfully building coalition nations isolate Iran pressure live obligations." At hearing Senate Armed Services Committee, Lt. Gen. Ronald L. Burgess Jr., director Defense Intelligence Agency, Gen. James E. Cartwright, vice chairman Joint Chiefs Staff one military's experienced officers nuclear matters, said Iran could produce bomb-grade fuel least one nuclear weapon within year, would probably need two five years manufacture workable atomic bomb.
