FYI The Christian Science Monitor - CSMonitor.com War terror: Obama softened language, hardened Muslim hearts The Obama administration's shift counterterrorism language sought bridge divide Muslim world soften Americans' fear Islam. But new rhetoric hasn't matched policy, unintended costs home abroad high. By Stuart Gottlieb posted October 14, 2010 9:58 EDT New Haven, Conn. — One defining aspects Obama administration's counterterrorism strategy effort change America's rhetorical approach threat terrorism, particularly Islamic terrorism. "The language use matters," President Obama told Arabic satellite television station Al Arabiya interview first week office. Scrubbed George W. Bush-era terms like "war terrorism," "radical Islam," "jihadist."The White House's 2010 National Security Strategy formally replaced term "Islamic terrorism" "violent extremism." The purpose shift semantics two-fold. First, aimed repackage fight terrorism specific fight Al Qaeda, Islamic extremism, Mr. Obama believes contributed post-9/11 perception America "at war Islam." Indeed, new rhetoric gone hand hand Obama's outreach Muslim world build "a new partnership based mutual respect mutual interest." Second, part broader effort soften Americans' fear Islamic terrorism, Obama officials believe plays directly hands extremists. Language change ineffective Now fair ask whether Obama's use language regarding terrorism proven effective. Startling new polls suggest hasn't. The first, Brookings Institution Washington, shows May 2009 May 2010 number Middle Eastern Arabs expressing optimism Obama's approach toward region dropped 51 percent 16 percent, describing "discouraged" Obama presidency rising 15 percent 63 percent. The second, Pew Research Center, shows August 2010 fewer Americans held favorable view Islam (30 percent) five years earlier Bush administration (41 percent), Americans (35 percent) saying Islam encourages violence religions (in 2002, 25 percent). These starkly negative trend lines suggest limited utility language fighting terrorism. Yes, terrorism propaganda-fueled activity – ongoing battle win hearts minds attract new recruits fight cause. And course language used combating terrorism vital – counterproductive "smoke 'em out" rhetoric Bush administration case point. But rhetoric match policy, appears discount play threats, credibility – thus effectiveness – overall counterterrorism strategy may undermined. It appears Obama administration dug hole. Rhetoric doesn't match policy When looking beyond nuanced language appealing promises, Muslims around world see administration ramped war Afghanistan; killing scores Muslim civilians drone strikes; continues hold 1,000 Muslim detainees Guantanamo, Bagram, prisons; maintains seemingly unconditional support Israel. This critique policies, point match raised expectations Muslim world muddled Obama's oft-stated goal turning Muslims toward America away extremist movements. The price downplaying threat A large price also paid domestically disconnected rhetoric. Despite maintaining nearly Bush's hard-line tactics — USA Patriot Act, warrantless surveillance, indefinite detentions White House consistently played threat, even face clear uptick terrorism activity. For example, following failed 2009 Christmas Day airline bombing, Obama described suspect "isolated extremist," despite ties Al Qaeda. And administration's initial response failed May 2010 Times Square bombing American Muslim trained Pakistan call "one-off' event. Attorney General Eric Holder stated congressional testimony believed recent Islamic terror plots unconnected, unrelated radical Islam. There little doubt administration's unwillingness speak candidly Islamic terrorism taken toll public's trust. A Gallup poll released last month shows Americans favoring Republicans Democrats issue terrorism 55 percent 31 percent — 49 percent 42 percent last fall. Time reverse trend Obama entered office promising fight smarter effective war terrorism, many ways has. His instincts maintain aggressive tactics toning inflammatory rhetoric sound. Yet administration seems overlearned key lesson Bush years — overstating threat terrorism costs attached. So, too, rhetoric understates threat, especially detached policy. It late reverse troubling trend. The White House begin focusing less overly reassuring rhetoric — paid dividends home abroad — candid accounting threats faced policies employed confront them.
