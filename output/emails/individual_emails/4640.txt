Hillary Cheryl, I'm feeling good recent efforts connect speeches thematically. We've done development, human rights, Internet freedom; recently AIPAC, Ctr Middle East Peace, next AJC. Here's I want suggest: The three basic elements human existence food, water, health. We done major speeches food water. I'd like us consider major speech global health â€” third trilogy. Linking three issues thematically, explain foreign policy challenges solutions must seen prism human survival conditions people's lives influence everything economic development political stability more. This trilogy speeches (with right PR) could underscore elevation development AND comprehensive, smart power approach foreign policy. After all, food, water, health sine qua non human progress. And Hillary Clinton signature idea, least me. Thoughts? LM
