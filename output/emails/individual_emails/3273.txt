Gelb November 22, 2009 I 10:50pm The Asia trip worth Obama's time. Leslie H. Gelb president shake foreign policy team—and make sure deals done leaves home. President Obama's nine-day trip Asia worth look back fix two potent problems, past future. First, trip's limited value per day presidential effort suggests disturbing amateurishness managing America's power. On top inexcusably clumsy review Afghan policy fumbling Mideast negotiations, message Mr. Obama clear: He stare hard skills foreign-policy team and, so, dominant role decision-making. Something awry somewhere, he's got fix it. Secondly, Asia trip presented important opportunity carve new American leadership role world's dynamic economic region, Mr. Obama missed it. He scratched surface calls multilateralism mutual understanding. He needs paint pictures Washington help solve regional security trade problems. Otherwise, Asian nations continue unwanted drift toward China away United States. A meditation journey start forgetting half last week's commentary. Unbelievably, criticized Obama getting China "throw weight around." What Asian leaders want that? None I know of. Others lamented Obama couldn't make "demands" China anymore. The presumption China king, Washington longer way Beijing. The facts Washington never boss Beijing around, China ruling roost (more accurately, it's sitting eggs). Others contended Obama continued pattern trashing America's friends coddling authoritarian enemies like China. It's hard stomach nonsense conservative crowd forever praised George W. Bush accommodating China alienating America's allies. Some analysts played fair acknowledged administration officials tried tell reporters expect "deliverables" trip, see journey recognition Asia's new importance America's desire new co- operative spirit. That's commendable thought, hardly justification almost two weeks president's time (when consider preparations)— especially he's got tanking economy, health-care reform woes, decisions make Afghanistan. Presidents take trips like one need breakthroughs accomplishments certain issues can't agreed without pressure impending presidential visit. In fact, presidents wouldn't even commit trips abroad without knowing key deals would finally agreed announced visit itself. The prospective visit power jackhammer nail deals. Just take gander trips planned Richard Nixon Henry Kissinger George H. W. Bush James Baker. Obama's travels chance settle make concrete progress thorny issues like greenhouse-gas emissions, fate U.S. bases Okinawa, new Japanese government insists moving. It time announce ways gain fixes U.S.-South Korean trade treaty, long stalled Congress. It moment show Beijing would actually make mutually beneficial compromises exchange rates economic sanctions Iranian North Korean nuclear programs. Absent guarantees progress issues these, Mr. Obama taken well- deserved vacation Hawaii. Matters made worse scene. It good optics Obama bow Japan's emperor. He seems stuff spontaneously inexplicably, bow Saudi King months ago. And truly unfortunate Obama aides didn't flatly insist allowed address Chinese people directly television meet non-stacked Chinese groups—as case previous presidential visits. Beijing's leaders obviously didn't feel confident enough standing home give popular Mr. Obama access. But team made precondition visit. Its absence left unhappy taste. The Asia trip presented important opportunity carve new American leadership role world's dynamic economic region, Mr. Obama missed it. The White House might try blame State Department (such easy delicious target) missteps. But State's role conceptual planning trip central, department's senior Asia hand, Kurt Campbell, surely knew better.

If Mr. Obama reflects Asia journey mishaps, might loosen reins bring additional policy diplomatic pros inside counselors outside advisers. If Asia hands inside outside government designed Obama trip, here's would advised: Go beyond usual trite message building mutual understanding cooperation, stop invoking God Multilateralism without spelling America's leadership role. Asia overflowing multilateral organizations. Washington member key ones, like Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Asian Development Bank. But little new key groupings Shanghai Cooperation Organization (Russia, China, Uzbekistan, etc.) ASEAN, association Southeast Asian nations. Asian nations increasingly organizing groups, Washington hasn't really figured role. Most Asian nations want role prominent one—in fact, leadership position. They're afraid China, afraid China won't attentive concerns future America past. At time, don't want Washington come groupings cause problems Beijing. They want Washington figure leadership position constructed proven American ability help solve common problems common interest. They want America remember, one get things done doesn't let problems fester. That U.S. policy main missing ingredient Obama's trip. Washington played architect solidified leadership Europe World War II NATO, Marshall Plan, various trade economic organizations like World Bank. Asian nations yearning kind creativity today brilliant American president new Pacific Era. Leslie H.
