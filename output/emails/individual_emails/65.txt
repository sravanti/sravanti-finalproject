With presidential campaign drowning boredom, commentators desperately searching news, preferably new victim, brighten days. And along came Susan Rice. A couple Sundays ago, U.N. ambassador made mistake appearing talk shows insist attack U.S. consulate Benghazi, Libya, "spontaneous" rather terrorist plot. You would thought said pope Mormon. Out came Washington daggers. She lied. She shill. Benghazi spontaneous event. It work al Qaeda offshoot. The White House fumbled key intelligence information trying cover unforgivable mistake. Rice covering president. Her reward would Obama's nominating succeed Hillary Clinton secretary State. The commentariat immediately rolled plans nail Rice Obama team wall. Peter King, Grand Inquisitor Republicans House Representatives, pledged "investigate" hold hearings. And that, said commentariat, would end Rice's hopes become new Hillary.

Rice didn't make story. The problem Rice; inevitably complicated U.S. intelligence process. Her mistake taking initial intelligence face value. The White House biiefers made error, I. I repeated op-ed The Daily Beast intelligence briefers told me, I knew well contradictory information would appear soon enough. It always does. Sure, CIA additional intel start, hadn't begun sift communications intercepts, satellite photos, human reports. It always takes time sort facts fictions find consistent threads. Seemingly, gossamer information taking shape. Meantime, Rice still much running job Fogg' Bottom, along Senator John Kerry, NSC Adviser Tom Donilon, former diplomat Nicholas Burns, Harvard. She Obama's earliest loyalist foreign-policy crowd, still likes her, despite lackluster reports performance U.N. The smears, though flatly inaccurate, won't help either.
