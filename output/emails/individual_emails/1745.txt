Sorry flood email, I couldn't resist sending Ben Smith A year later, Hillary wins A year ago today, final set primaries made official foregone conclusion Barack Obama won primary, Hillary Clinton lost it. There's far much going today dwell anniversary, seem worth noting one particular piece news light: On central health care policy debate Democratic Primary -- was, fair, conducted within fairly narrow frame -- Obama appears conceded today Senate plan likely closely resemble Clinton's. In dense, careful letter Ted Kennedy Max Baucus, Obama offered principles health care plan conceded central point: He open individual mandate, campaigned against, talked Senators parties buzzword "shared responsibility." Obama still backs "hardship waiver" people unable afford mandate -- consistent core objection mandate. But cast principled difference approach -- problem merely people couldn't afford insurance? something more? -- seems conceded. Here's relevant paragraph: I understand Committees moving towards principle shared responsibility -- making every American responsible health insurance coverage, asking employers share cost. I share goal ending lapses gaps coverage make us less healthy drive everyone's costs, I open ideas shared responsibility. But I believe going make people responsible owning health insurance, must make health care affordable. If end system people responsible insurance, need provide hardship waiver exempt Americans cannot afford it. In addition, I believe employers responsibility support health insurance employees, small businesses face number special challenges affording health benefits exempted. B6 B6 By Ben Smith 07:51 PM
