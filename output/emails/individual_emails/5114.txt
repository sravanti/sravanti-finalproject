Gaza: it's Hamas's move Hamas must seize initiative ever end Israel's occupation Palestine • • c) Jeremy Greenstock o quardian.co.uk, Wednesday 2 June 2010 12.29 BST So happened again. Nearly 18 months Israelis bombed Gaza wasteland, barely load building materials allowed since then, Turkey taken brunt operation humanitarian assistance gone wrong. The UN must establish facts impartially independently and, laws broken, responsible must held account. Political demonstrations posing relief flotillas go wrong easily Israel understandably prevent weapons smuggled Gaza. But really best way bring ships shore examination? A commando attack civilian ships looks callous disproportionate. No one hurt, whatever emotions behind this. Why Gaza siege first place? Under international law, Israelis responsible occupying force proper administration territory; half point Israel law. Yet creating traumatised territory 1.5m neighbours, many whose children seem want grow suicide bombers. They also pouring fertiliser al-Qaida's ground. The director UNRWA operations Gaza, John Ging, gave speech London week entitled "Illegal, inhuman. insane: medieval siege Gaza 2010". This objective humanitarian practitioner listened to. How Israel, democracy region symbol need racially inspired violence end, come risk claim international legitimacy handling situation? Hamas enemy Israel, be. They preach violent resistance readily, yet past 17 months trying control militant groups intent threatening Israel rockets — imperfectly perhaps, single Israeli citizen killed (alas, one immigrant worker was) rocket since Gaza bombing stopped January 2009. They also implacable opponents al-Qaida. They won fair election 2006 claim respect democracy. Let's test that. At present, Hamas security people sniped Israeli Defence Forces try arrest militant groups. This genuinely getting insane. The unwisdom reliance angry military responses clearer mood Palestine, West Bank Gaza, steadily moving towards negotiated end occupation. I convinced direct experience Hamas prepared establish respect long-term ceasefire talking start without threat violence, would enter good faith, reciprocated, negotiations establish two states disputed territories, Israel Palestine, rights responsibilities international law. The distortion position, little fault PR, side good. If comprehensive negotiation much expect now, first step? I believe arrangement end blockade within reach Israel, Egypt Gaza would test possibilities dialogue. Hamas indicated could cease attacks Israeli soil, close tunnels, release Gilead Shalit stop import arms Gaza blockade ended, agreed number Palestinian prisoners released Gaza began rebuilt. The Palestinians course work internal reconciliation, relationship Fatah West Bank Hamas Gaza remains bad. But UN, US, Russia, EU Arab world must make much serious attempt test possibilities, putting ordinary Israelis Palestinians first, political comfort. We coming close losing chance two-state solution. US policy, based West-Bank-only approach, locked cul-de-sac Gaza left equation, majority Palestinian support lacking. Israel confident knowledge cannot militarily defeated. But ignores huge danger losing political, diplomatic, legal moral high ground. This matters today's world, US UK discovered Iraq, government authority public opinion interact closely, legitimacy breeds support. Israel's relationship Turkey key broader understanding Islamic community others beyond west. That lies tatters. If Israel left permanent occupier, controlling one-state structure part population downgraded imprisoned, truly disaster people stand for. I hope Hamas sit back enjoy Israel's discomfiture. They far, political organisation, attracted much narrow range international support. If wish widely accepted negotiating partner, must unequivocally accept fully justified condition set international Quartet — cessation violence — underline objective two-state settlement, win international friends ending occupation. In whoever's hands, bombs, bullets, rockets iron bars achieve nothing. But push justice will. •This article originally written Times published
