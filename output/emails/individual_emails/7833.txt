sbwhoeop Saturday, December 4, 2010 7:08 PM H: Kathleen Palin JFK. Sid B6 Sarah Palin wrong John F. Kennedy, religion politics By Kathleen Kennedy Townsend Friday, December 3, 2010; 6:00 PM Sarah Palin found new opponent debate: John F. Kennedy. In new book, "America Heart," Palin objects uncle's famous 1960 speech Greater Houston Ministerial Association, challenged ministers - country - judge him, Catholic presidential candidate, views rather faith. "Contrary common newspaper usage, I Catholic candidate president," Kennedy said. "I Democratic Party's candidate president happens also Catholic." Palin writes growing up, taught Kennedy's speech "succeeded best possible way: It reconciled public service religion without compromising either." Now, however, says revisited speech changed mind. She finds "defensive . . . tone content" upset Kennedy, rather presenting reconciliation private faith public role, instead offered "unequivocal divorce two." Palin's argument seems challenge great American tradition, enshrined Constitution, stipulating religious test public office. A careful reading book leads conclude Palin wishes precisely test. And seems think she, think like her, qualified judge would pass would not. If religious test, need candidate's religious affiliation "reconciled." My uncle urged religion private, removed politics, feared making faith arena public contention would lead American politics ill-disguised religious warfare, candidates tempted use faith manipulate voters demean opponents. Kennedy cited Thomas Jefferson argue that. part American tradition, essential keep semblance religious test political realm. Best judge candidates public records, positions war peace, jobs, poverty, health care. No one, Kennedy pointed out, asked died Alamo church belonged to. But Palin insists evaluating acting authority candidates' faith. She faults Kennedy "telling country faith enriched him." With line, proceeds path fraught danger - precisely path uncle warned said president's religious views "neither imposed upon nation imposed nation upon condition holding office." After all, candidate's faith matter believe right serve arbiters faith. Is worthy? Is deep? Is reflected certain ideology? Palin criticizes Kennedy because, "rather spelling faith groups provided life-changing services education millions Americans, repeatedly objected government assistance religious schools." She seem appreciate Kennedy courageous arguing government funds used parochial schools, despite temptation please constituents. Many Catholics would liked money. But wisely thought use public dollars places nuns explicitly proselytized would unconstitutional. Tax money used persuade someone join religion. As contrast Kennedy's speech, Palin cites former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney's remarks 2008 Republican primary campaign, spoke publicly "how faith would inform presidency, I elected." After paying lip service separation church state, Romney condemned unnamed enemies "intent establishing new religion America - religion secularism." "There one fundamental question I often asked," Romney said. "What I believe Jesus Christ?" Romney, course, Mormon. He answered question, proclaiming "Jesus Christ son God." Palin praises Romney delivering "thoughtful speech eloquently correctly described role faith American public life." But religious test politics, candidate feel compelled respond misplaced questions belief Jesus? When George Romney, Mitt Romney's father, presidential candidate 1968, felt compulsion. Respect Constitution founders' belief separation church state suggests kinds questions play role political campaigns. Palin contends Kennedy sought "run away religion." The truth uncle knew quite well made America special revolutionary assertion freedom religion. No nation Earth ever framed law faith interest government officials. For centuries, European authorities murdered tortured whose religious beliefs differed own. To demand citizens display religious beliefs attacks foundation nation undermines precise reason America exceptional. Palin's book makes clear dangerous proposed path be. Not want people reveal beliefs, wants sit judgment views don't match own. For instance, criticizes Rep. Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), Democrat faithful Catholic, "talking (God) talk walking walk." Who Palin say God's "walk" is? Who anointed grand inquisitor? This woman also praises Abraham Lincoln's Second Inaugural, even though Lincoln explicitly declared, "But let us judge judged." The problem setting free-floating tribunal evaluate faith that, contrary Lincoln, installing judges look others' souls assess worthiness. Kennedy would that, indifferent faith. In fact, unlike Romney Palin, fealty faith Constitution, promised day Houston would resign religion ever interfered duty president. My uncle man faith tested. His brother brother-in-law killed World War II, sister died plane crash soon war. He suffered painful injuries inflicted Navy service PT boat cut two Japanese destroyer. His God make life easy require commitment justice. America's first oniy Catholic president referred God three times p_;.-: .:1,rai.adc'res invoked Bible's command care poor sick. Later presidency, 1.-.a ur;:•:-.1uvocaliv. riohi:s: We confronted primarily moral issue. It old Scriptures clear American Constitution." Faith runs deep current family. Faith inspired uncles' father's dedication justice. My father, Robert F. Kennedy, returning apartheid-era South Africa 1966, wrote magazine article titled "Suppose God Is - Black." And uncle Teddy fought health care Americans, even book }Dalin presumes judge took positions "directly odds Catholic faith." Teddy Kennedy believed stands one faith. He disagree Roman Catholic hierarchy times. But seen, hierarchy's positions change, church, obligation help bring changes. That may Palin's theology, glory America support would disagree - even difficult personal matters, religion. John F. Kennedy knew tearing wall separating church state would tempt us toward self-righteousness contempt others. That one reason delivered Houston speech. Palin, part, argues "morality cannot sustained without support religious beliefs." That statement amounts wholesale attack countless Americans, study reasonable argument I seen heard would support blanket condemnation. For person claims admire Lincoln, Palin curiously ignores injunction Americans, even engaged Civil War, show "malice toward none, charity ail." Pal fails understand genius nation. The United States one vibrant religious countries Earth precisely religious freedom. When power faith entwined, faith loses. Power tends obfuscate, corrupt focus temporal rather eternal purposes. Somehow Palin misses this. Perhaps didn't read full Houston speech; certainly doesn't know heart. Or may appealing religious right really seeks secular power. I don't know. I certain, however, American political leader cavalierly - political calculation - dismiss hard- won ideal religious freedom among country's greatest gifts world. As John F. Kennedy said Houston, "kind America I believe in."
