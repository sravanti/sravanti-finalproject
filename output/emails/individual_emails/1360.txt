They surprised see strangers -- five women two men -- sitting chairs boys typically occupy. The students find empty seats shrug matching brown coats mismatched scarves. They curious visitors lean-back, fold-your-arms, prove-it kind way. "I'm James Forman," begins 40-something man. "I'm professor Georgetown Law School -- " "You related James Forman?" interrupts 17-year-old Carleto Bailey. "I'm James Forman Jr." "That father? James Forman dad?" Carleto demands. "Yes, I " "Wasn't big civil rights guy? NAACP? Or SNCC?" "SNCC," Forman says, seemingly surprised Carleto heard father, executive secretary Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee years 1960s becoming active Black Panthers. B6 "He's good guy," Carleto continues. "You tell that." Forman smiles. "He passed years ago, would happy hear this," professor says. He scans room. The Oak Hill students, African American, dressed identically khaki pants royal-blue polo shirts. They chosen seats edges room and, sitting down, pushed chairs back far possible wall. Forman's Georgetown law students -- African American, Arab, Latino, Caucasian -- jeans sweaters. They lean forward, intent maybe little bit nervous. "I teach class juvenile justice law school," Forman continues. "And I thought would really good way law students learn juvenile justice. There certain amount learn reading, also need see experience things. So I thought would learn lot coming hearing experiences." Carleto raises eyebrow. This new one. "And benefit know things law don't. Ya'll certain things know. They certain things know. It learning opportunity everybody." Forman suggests go around room share names interesting fact themselves. Dead silence. He smiles encouragingly. "My name James Forman, I helped start organization, See Forever, runs school," says. Carleto, leaning back two rear legs chair, brings bang sends short dreads swinging forward black plastic rectangular glasses sliding nose. A Georgetown students jump. He looks top glasses. "My name's Carleto Bailey," says. "My interesting fact I'm funny./I He gives wide smile bright white teeth. The Georgetown students laugh. Oak Hill student Ashawntea Henderson, 17, sits next him, rolls eyes. But Carleto's done: "And I'm smart." But turns out, Georgetown folks -- like teachers Oak Hill Academy -- aren't going accept Carleto's assertion face value. They want good grades, right answers multiple-choice test. They want prove think. Forman shows group excerpt film juveniles incarcerated New York's Rikers Island. Afterward, law students want know whether label makes difference. It's hard question. "Inmates? Residents? Scholars?" one asks. "Does matter you're called?" Carleto studies woman's face discern wants hear back. It blank. He struggles. "Not much," says, finally. He looks her. She seems unconvinced. He worries given wrong answer tries again. "Back community, certain [police] patrols neighborhood say, 'I know you're to.' When come home, us trying right, basically criticize us you're already labeled." "What labels?" Forman asks. This one easy Carleto. He sinks chair throws out. "Trouble," says. *** Carleto Bailey trouble. He also, rightly noted, smart. But arrived Oak Hill Academy disadvantages: He poorly educated D.C. public schools, frequently truant multiple run-ins law. The D.C. Department Youth Rehabilitation Services, runs Oak Hill, won't release information specific crime landed Carleto still juvenile, know Carleto's second time detention center. His academic knowledge spotty best. He tell James Forman is, comma falls letter's greeting. ("Dear, Fidel" writes mock letter Castro English class.) He fairly typical Oak Hill "scholar." And, upon time, would written But today, staff fledgling Oak Hill Academy determined view kids' captive time window opportunity fill gaping holes education. Part reform initiative Vincent Schiraldi, director Youth Rehabilitation Services, school opened doors last year takes unique approach teaching delinquent youth. What would happen, Oak Hill Academy co-founders Forman David Domenici wondered, seduced kids content meaningful them? What would happen lots good, caring teachers small classrooms? What one assumed kids could learn -- behaved such? In words, would happen District's challenged students got private school education, albeit campus decidedly different nature? "The bottom line," says Domenici, "is kids risk need highest quality programming, they've gotten worst." It conviction drove Domenici, also school's principal, Forman create three public charter schools underprivileged troubled students District past 11 years. Called Maya Angelou schools, two high schools middle school attack educational deficiencies angles. Students attend small classes taught specially trained staff. The high school day stretches 9 a.m. 6 p.m., three meals provided. Some kids, whose home lives prove chaotic study, offered supervised housing neighborhood. And works. Last year, 93 percent Maya Angelou graduates accepted two- four-year colleges, Domenici says. (According District's Office State Superintendent Education, 29 percent students enter ninth grade D.C. public schools city charter schools enroll postsecondary educational programs within 18 months graduating high school.) It good model. But even though Domenici Forman used teaching court-involved youth -- 40 percent Maya Angelou students spent time Oak Hill -- working inside gates posed new set challenges. Youth Rehabilitation Services court monitor 23 years due part history abuse poor conditions. When Schiraldi took department 2005 began reform efforts implementing less punitive therapeutic detention model Oak Hill, saw immediately changing school essential. "How could I look staff Oak Hill say excellence kids sitting school total waste time 9 3 every day?" Schiraldi says. Kids sat watched movies day. Little, teaching going on, Schiraldi says. "It miserable, miserable school." Schiraldi immediately began lobbying D.C. Board Education hard hire someone new operate school, soon got okay, put request proposals. Domenici Forman submitted plan Schiraldi says "blew ones water," 2007 awarded $12 million contract run school next three years. Domenici's Forman's partnership somewhat unlikely one. Domenici son former New Mexico Republican senator Pete Domenici. He went Stanford Law School, worked corporate law years gave teach work teen delinquents. Forman grandson Jessica Mitford, daughter British baron celebrated civil rights activist journalist. Forman, graduated Yale Law School, worked law clerk Justice Sandra Day O'Connor D.C. public defender. After seeing good schooling options teenage clients had, joined forces Domenici, met mutual friend, start independent school 20 students 1997. A year later, became part first Maya Angelou public charter school. At Oak Hill Academy, principal Domenici fights occasionally maddening bureaucracy basics: functioning boilers, permission college tour group six students, classes uninterrupted corrections staff sometimes call three-quarters students middle class take meds. Forman chairman Maya Angelou Public Charter School Board Directors board member parent group, See Forever Foundation. He attacks hurdles side, fundraising advocating juvenile justice reform. "When David came run school here, like "Ocean's 12": Go find people trust previous mission," Forman jokes. That included past colleagues even Maya Angelou graduates. Samantha Crandal Simpore, then-coed Oak Hill 15 accessory assault charge, went Maya Angelou school runs Oak Hill Academy welcome center. "I tell them, I here, too," Simpore says. She tells new student 17 years old didn't know multiplication tables, rode bus school day hooked Walkman, hoping one knew listening recitation times tables. "I say: 'You're intersection life. You know what's street behind you. Nothing that. But choice what's road ahead.'" Many 90 Oak Hill students, ranging age 14 19, come performing way grade level, nearly half diagnosed learning disabilities. They Oak Hill average 10 months, cycling schedule nothing nine-month academic year. Out necessity, grouped according cell blocks live keep opposing gangs separate. Thirteen-year-olds classes 18-year-olds. More half committed Oak Hill violent felonies. Fights common. (Before month out, Carleto get fistfight hallway delay release date.) Through use small classes -- typically five 14 teens work one teacher, teaching assistant guard -- school organizes curriculum around four-week themes designed pique students' curiosity get think critically nature democracy, social justiCe role world. For example, Relationship theme, students parse types relationships ranging humans natural world (ancient river civilizations) individuals groups (Pharaohs subjects) humans ideas (liberation theology). At time, English class, students working standard five-paragraph essay via guiding question: "Why relationships matter, relationships good bad people?" With current unit, Change, D.C. public school system's learning standards woven social studies curriculum loose headings "Changes Way Humans Think About World Their Place It," becomes way introducing scientific revolution, Enlightenment Magna Carta. It's philosophy emphasizes learning making cross-discipline connections long popular affluent, progressive schools typically eschewed schools underprivileged kids, rote learning return basics often rule. Oak Hill Academy also created course called Advocacy, Georgetown law students co- teaching, emphasizing month's theme. Domenici believes learning law works democracy "is essential teaching good citizens." "We always believed one roles help kids self-advocate advocate behalf community," Domenici says. "We think good skill students individually also one democracy demands." But ambitious agenda, Oak Hill Academy faces significant obstacles. Can teach teens think critically they're missing basic underpinnings education? How teach empowerment setting demands rigid compliance keep kids misbehaving? Although sometimes grows discouraged, Domenici best buoy staff members learn one promising students got fight unit "graduated" program commit another crime sent back. "I talk staff fact that, day day, job absolute best work domain within control," says, reminding don't control pieces puzzle. "And well, done moral thing." His staff members must keep faith straddling two equally potent realities: First, knowledge power, possessing it, every student capable success. And, absent right support, failure lurks right around corner. It sounds like this: "I think Carleto good chance finishing high school going college," Domenici says. Pause. "Also, highly risk that." *** It cold day late January, Oak Hill midst four-week session change. Dressed jeans, blue shirt gray corduroy jacket (the heat's working), Oak Hill social studies teacher John Adams paces around room stops bend Carleto, doodling piece paper desk. "Pay attention," says, taking Carleto's pencil. "Carleto, today's essential question?" "What historical change, different kinds change?" Carleto says, reading board Adams scrawled topic. "Yes," Adams says. He ignores student wandering around room aimlessly, student snatches hat classmate tosses toward hallway. A youth development specialist, corrections guards referred Schiraldi, appears deeply engrossed magazine back room. But snatches hat mid-air, scowls disruptive student tucks hat pocket. "Please sit," Adams tells student. Not quite sitting, quite standing, student perches edge Adams's desk. Good enough. Adams continues: "What's difference personal change historical change?" Silence. "Anybody? More silence. "Ashawntea?" "Historical change like revolution," Ashawntea says. Adams throws list changes -- getting raise salary, moving new house, election President Obama -- Carleto accurately sorts changes micro macro, personal historical. "Obama's campaign change," Adams says. "Do think talking historical change?" He wants students think president, office two days. What might first 100 days look like? asks students. "What advice would offer him?" Carleto looks stumped. "Just throw ideas," Adams prompts. He tells students going craft letters president, advising set agenda change. Carleto slaps pencil desk. "Obama's reading letters," says. He folds arms across chest, skeptical president lay eyes letter -- skeptical, perhaps, teachers really want hear ideas. *** Later, Carleto acknowledge knows quite bit president, reading Barack Obama's "Dreams From My Father." "It started good book, got excellent," says. He struggles hard articulate book's themes appeal. "I don't know put it," says finally, "but growing -- disrespect, -- Caucasian mom African father, still made through." Sitting guard's room gym February evening, echoing sound classmates bouncing basketballs around cavernous gym, Carleto goes tell possibly apocryphal story. "As child, fun, happy -- far kindergarten sixth grade. Starting first grade, honor roll also making school every day," says, beginning third person, quickly lapsing first. "In late stages middle school; end eighth grade, I started smoking weed, stuff I wasn't supposed doing." He takes full responsibility. "No one peer-pressured anything. I liking going I high," explains. He, like almost teens Oak Hill, denies involved gang. Still, Carleto says best friend since elementary school killed 10th grade "a neighborhood thing." "Nowadays, anyone ride you, mistaken someone else shot," says, explaining buddy shot "miscommunication." "It wasn't intended us," says, insisting friend, nicknamed "Smoke," waiting bus. Then announces, "I don't want talk it." So doesn't, though clearly haunts him: He doodle "R.I.P. Smoke" cover blue folder piece loose-leaf paper comer chalkboard. He's happy talk Oak Hill Academy though, 3.5 grade-point average six months. (Domenici says Carleto top 25 percent students Oak Hill tests fairly high assessments.) Carleto likes school even though bit easy him, senior freshman. He complains classes short guards always interrupting move class getting warmed up. That really bugs him, doesn't say much. He says leaving Oak Hill two months intends finish schooling Oak Hill's transition center District, says graduate June. When gets out, couple things wants right off, says. First, intends see girlfriend, go restaurant go "the Adidas shop Georgetown, mom get stuff-- dad, too." He says mom pretty upset got arrested sent Oak Hill. "She was. . . I'm going say kind like surprised actions, I done," Carleto says. "You know say 'Whatever hides dark, comes out?'. . . She ashamed me, disappointed me." Meanwhile, makes long, 45-minute trek District Laurel visit. "Every weekend, days!" says. He alternately vague specific describes family life. He four brothers -- ages 27, 23, 16 11 -- reports two younger brothers live mom. He says mom works secretary, struggles remember where. "She working with, what's program downtown Washington Monument, dealing Smokey Bear?. . . I'm trying think. It's right Holocaust Museum. It's brick building. She works there." Later, Carleto's school case worker, Essence Jones, offer somewhat different account Carleto's life. Although Carleto 12th grade, graduate June says. He still six credits shy, Jones says. And least three months -- two -- release. Carleto's father part life, Jones says. The teenager living aunt coming Oak Hill. His mother, rap sheet dating 1982, jail years, arrested repeatedly string felonies misdemeanors, including possession distribution drugs, well prostitution. She prison since 2005, serving three consecutive sentences totaling seven years assault dangerous weapon, attempted distribution cocaine violation bail. She visiting Carleto weekends. *** By end February, still midst unit change, Oak Hill teens file advocacy class, jostling other, edgy. It unseasonably warm outside, want here. Reluctantly take seats, Carleto positions see patch brown grass mud prison yard, visible door someone wedged open. Occasionally, breeze wafts room. Today, law students decide tackle topic disproportionate minority confinement. If youths color 35 percent general population United States, 62 percent prison population, disproportionate minority confinement, law students explain. They refer teens handout desk front him, article excerpt New American Media, "Racism Juvenile Justice System Revealed," explain isn't simply people color commit crimes: "African-American youths 4.5 times likely, Latinos 2.3 times likely, white youths detained identical offenses. About half white teenagers arrested drug charge go home without formally charged drawn system. Only one-quarter black teens arrested drug charges catch similar break." Although youth color 100 percent Oak Hill's population inmates and, indeed, 100 percent 721 juvenile delinquents currently committed Youth Rehabilitation Services care settings across city, disproportionate minority confinement hard concept teens grasp. Georgetown student Abby Fee tries pie graph, bar graph, sketch disproportionate Xs Os. Blank stares. Then slowly dawns Ashawntea they're talking about. "Hey," says, suddenly sitting forward. "They're switched around! Basically, there's us juveniles prison white juveniles -- even though there's them." "Yes," Fee says. "So population outside system looks lot different inside system." Ashavvntea sits back chair mull over. Fee law students move teens statistics speculative discussion reasons behind figures. They prepared role-playing game coax teens thinking different perspectives. Then, want students practice advocating change. "So, we're going three roles," Fee says, dividing teens pairs. "One group 15-year-old; one group playing math teacher; one group playing city council member." Carleto partner learn play city council member preparing presentation reforming police department. Carleto doesn't want city council member. He doesn't even want today. He wraps unwraps pencil bottom T-shirt. He puts glasses on, takes off. "How could maintain better relationships" police? Fee asks, settling chair help Carleto partner work this. Carleto throws pencil table. Won't answer. She asks again. Silence. Finally, offers sullen challenge. "Stop harassing people reason?" "How want treat people?" "Equally," says. He picks pencil tap, tat, taps desk. Fee tries get specific. "Don't arrest small problems. Instead, take home, tell family you're doing," Carleto's partner says, unconsciously slipping second person. "And think help crime stopped decreased general?" Fee prods. A long pause. Could minds whirring busily; could they're spacing out. Fee, teacher enrolling Georgetown, takes stride. She taps paper couple times repeats question. "Don't 10 15 cars patrolling area barely see police car," Carleto says. "Patrol ward equally?" asks Fee. Carleto writes down, adds: "I see lot cruel things done ain't right." Fee nods, encourages write down. Carleto's partner grabs pencil speaks writes. "The majority police shouldn't carry guns. I could say, 'The majority police racist.'" "But would fix that?" Fee. prods. "A camera car catch they're -- secret one," Carleto suggests. He sits straighter chair. "And don't pull people they're black. They say anything, that's reason I pulled over, headlights whatever." Suddenly, Carleto roll, rattles list improvements. "Call order city council," says Georgetown student Dania Ayoubi. Carleto partner stand front class. "Hello, I'm Mr. Jones, I city councilman," Carleto says, glancing paper twisting tail shirt free hand. "We complaints different communities wards police, suggestions cracking officers." He sounds nervous begins list. "Stop harassing minorities ethnic youths, treat equal race are. Also, police don't arrest situation school like fight anything. I feel arrested taken home. Then tell parents happened reason stopped police." He moves briskly suggestions twice, tentatively, tries actually making eye contact audience. In conclusion, says, "verbally abusing" youth won't tolerated more. "Basically, want crack officers removed, so." Another pair students rises begin presentation, teens interrupted crackle guard's walkie-talkie. "Time go!" guard announces. The law students surprised -- quite done -- politely acquiesce. "Wait!" Ashawntea says, standing up. "We got 10 minutes." "It take five minutes get stuff together get coats on," guard says. "But 10 minutes!" Carleto insists. He Ashawntea sit back fold arms. "It's 2:20. We got 10 minutes still." The guard takes beat, shrugs concedes Carleto's point. He goes back hall wait. Carleto shoots Ashawntea look surprise. His advocacy worked. "Yesss!" Ashawntea hisses breath.
