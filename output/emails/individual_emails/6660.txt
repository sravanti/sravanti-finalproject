Declan, Thanks email. Of course it's personal. But I think it's wrong. When Government believed could succeed treated Northern Ireland bi-partisan issue I encouraged Governments adopt approach. That meant President Bush White House, I went way always see brief Democrats - Congress Senate - whenever I came States. It also meant held first economic conference led Mayor Bloomberg Belfast, dinner gave Hillsborough restricted respective Governments. In respect handled issue within UK, didn't mean I invited Shadow Secretary State share every platform, Shadow excluded major events. Indeed made point saying bi-partisan, acted accordingly. Having brokered Hillsborough Agreement discussed Secretary State - stages - US could help Economic Conference, I obviously somewhat disappointed invited attend Conference capacity. That course never confused deep respect admiration Secretary Clinton. Frankly without help time White House, Senator, candidate Secretary, could never made progress did. You know that, time, I always disappointed contribution peace process political process recognized appropriately Conservative Party spokesmen Opposition. The decision Owen Patterson decide present next week's Conference matter political demands chosen determine priorities. You would expect comment decision. However, I don't rehearse successful long-term economic investment Northern Ireland require building stable peace process, continuing build cross-party cross-community consensus. I sorry invited help. The current coalition Government Britain always power may even last course. It seems regrettable challenging global economic environment us helped build peace even invited continue helping. Best, Shaun
