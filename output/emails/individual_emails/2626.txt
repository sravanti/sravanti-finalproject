Hillary: Peter Galbraith called I long talk him. As know, chief US mission UN Afghanistan protested election fraud come conflict head UN there, wanted cover up. Peter come Afghanistan four solid months there. He pessimistic, says analogy Vietnam wrong-headed, comparisons increasing troop levels though surge Iraq could replicated misguided, thinks approach attempted involves vote recount trying replace Karzai. He wishes speak directly. He says difficulty communicating Holbrooke, can't reach him, finds Dick disjointed days. Peter plane right Norway, London, NY Wed, could go DC. He says reach US mission UN office. FYI, Wash Post today: "The issue seriously take fraud charges, whether force runoff, also caused rare public rift within international community here. The senior American official U.N. mission, Peter W. Galbraith, left country abruptly Sunday dispute mission director, Norwegian Kai Eide. "Galbraith pushed exhaustive probe. Sources familiar dispute authorized to. speak record said Eide argued international community press hard could undermine national stability. Galbraith convinced Karzai could win without fraud tried reduce number polling stations areas south, incumbent's ethnic stronghold, said one diplomatic source. Eide others, source said, convinced Karzai would win case irregularities could smoothed over, 2004 presidential election Karzai won safe margin."

Jane Smiley Pulitzer Prize-Winning Novelist Essayist Posted: September 17, 2009 02:56 PM HuffPost Book Review: Republican Gomorrah About twenty years ago, I read article death row inmate shot clerk convenience store. The way murder presented man death row mysterious--his hand rose gun went off. Shooting clerk face midst robbery wasn't fact fault. He never said, "I shot man." It happened. I thought man reading Max Blumenthal's terrific, also, course, appalling new book, Republican Gomorrah. Apparently isn't single person present incarnation Republican party anything. Things happen--God it. Satan it. No Republican agent success failure, sin redemption. It happens. The consequences lack responsibility see--screaming threats, guns rallies, unhinged behavior every time Republican doesn't feel way wants feel, absolute sense powerlessness leading directly absolute power. Because thing struck murderer 7-11--he power last moments, clerk knew it. But killer, matter well armed, never felt it. Republican Gomorrah frightening book clear us outside various Republican operatives surround James Dobson ilk consciences stop nothing. They invoke name God purposes shame God absolutely--hurting, destroying, maiming, damning others either don't accept beliefs don't acknowledge power righteousness. Of course frightening. But Blumenthal's cast characters, beginning Dobson prodigal son, Ryan, including John Hagee, Sarah Palin, Ralph Reed, Charles Colson, Judith Reisman, Christina Regnery, Donald Wildmon, et al. strike reader else small--egocentric, narrow minded, uneducated, selfish, resentful. Each qualities destructive The combination turning coercive. Even us immune emotions people play upon getting nervous power wish exert. Blumenthal two things one else I read manages do--the first organizes network. He shows Ted Bundy connected James Dobson connected Gary Bauer connected Erik Prince connected Ralph Reed connected Jack Abramoff connected Tom Delay connected Tony Perkins connected David Duke connected Mel Gibson, forth, course tracing connections, informs us, reminds us, crimes misdemeanors people committed. Two favorites James Dobson's son Ryan's messy divorce (Dad seems paid settlement--did dare discipline? Or discipline much?) David Vitter's habitual recourse brothel New Orleans Republicans "wanted spanked tortured wear stockings--Republicans impeccable taste silk stockings" (the madam talking men). Republican Gomorrah full crimes-- we've already heard of, Abramoffs Ted Haggard's, haven't (there good evidence Texas billionaire T. Cullen Davis, funder right wing Council For National Policy, ordered hits estranged wife, succeeded murdering step-daughter wife's boyfriend). This aspect book reminds Scottish novel called The Private Memoirs And Confessions Of A Justified Sinner James Hogg, which, man believes among saved, commit sin wants sure go heaven. Once Davis "saved," example, said, "My goal get heaven. I'll anything takes get there, I'm going let anything stand way." He must thought getting heaven another power play. And power plays key right wing psychology. Right wing psychology thing Blumenthal offer. At periphery world run-of-the-mill bully, man like Jack Abramoff, whose brutality well remembered high school classmates, sang like bird caught. At center James Dobson, much destructive figure Abramoff, advocates, strongest terms, child beating, child-beating, dog-beating. At one point brags going family canine (who weighed twelve pounds) engaging "the vicious fight ever staged man beast." As children, goal keep beating child "he wants(s) crumple breast parent." In words, Dobson proud sadist thinks sadism kind funny, who, years, successfully advocated sadism workable form child-rearing. It order understand deeply disturbing effect Dobson theories culture, Blumenthal cites Erich Fromm's Escape Freedom, psychology Nazism authoritarianism, Eric Hoffer's The True Believer. Insofar finds documentation, Blumenthal points many powerful Evangelical Christians beaten abused children (including Dobson). It's high number. The beatings, often arbitrary, cruel, frequent, then, many cases, backed constant lessons God--that arbitrary, cruel, demands obedience things, surpasseth understanding. The point exercises establish powerlessness child, shame guilt worthless sinner, absolute fear thinking He take place hierarchy thereby reinforce existence hierarchy. Blumenthal goes pretty far psychology, but, view, far enough. I'm sure reared liberal parents, gave sense responsibility, curiosity, autonomy, since thirties, I don't think really empathizes tortured damaged souls interviewing watching last years. I don't think understands fear--how deep is, constant is, arousing is. I don't think, fact, Max Blumenthal looks within sees evil. I think looks within, says, "I'm okay; you're okay." That's goal liberal parenting, tell statistics cites concerning unwed pregnancy, divorce, occurrence STDs, liberal parenting works-- atheists agnostics, example, much lower rate divorce Evangelicals, states sex education schools, rather abstinence-only education, lower rates teen pregnancy. But child beaten enough eventually comes understand two things all--that world makes sense (and try make sense it?) world dangerous oneself, even try figure oneself might be, death-defying exercise. There safety two things--conforming group and, part group, dominating even destroying groups. The rules group anything all, long members group abide them. And groups abide them, too, painful arbitrary rules group abides meaningless. The beaten child's sense terror assuaged evanescent feelings power, relation parents God, defined powerless. When "crumples" "loving" breast parent (and view person administers beating living 1/16th size doesn't know love is) accepts powerlessness also accepts power defines life. That's freedom mine come in. Many Evangelicals Blumenthal discusses Christian Dominionists--that is, differ Taliban choice doctrine. Their uses doctrine (to dehumanize women groups, never share power, control every aspect every life within power, create society steeply hierarchical structure top) Taliban. It's eye-opener read R.J. Rushdoony, son Armenian immigrants fled Armenian genocide 1915. You would think man whose family escaped mass murder would go espouse peace, love, understanding, Rushdoony went way, taking literally 613 laws Book Leviticus. In book, The Institutes Biblical Law, advocates capital punishment "disobedient children, unchaste women, apostates, blasphemers, practitioners witchcraft, adulterers," homosexuals. Gary North, Presbyterian Christian Reconstructionist, son-in-law, and, backing mass death penalty, advocates stoning rather burning stake, stoning cheaper (and course factor, would lot people exterminate). As would killing (of me, could catch us), well, Christians would, wanted to. Ever unable accept responsibility, assign agency God, wants us killed, beat us "crumple" "loving" breast, God given us sorts talents, skills, interests, is, like Christian Dominionists, interested power. I believe motto "Adore I hurt you." Can believe God small? When I parent young children, I, too, got frustrated, I, too, thought spanking might good thing. I soon realized motives administering physical punishment highly suspect--more anger frustration care child knowledge effective methods. I saw show child-rearing, woman firmly believed child- man beast." As children, goal keep beating child "he wants(s) crumple breast parent."

I soon realized motives administering physical punishment highly suspect--more anger frustration care child knowledge effective methods. I saw show child-rearing, woman firmly believed child- beating aroused far resistance beaten daughter, much family disruption, parents ignored tantrum used technique redirection train toddlers. Works horses, dogs, animals, too. It I decided I, human weakness, could put two two together concerning free proper behavior, surely God could, also. I didn't want believe God smaller myself. And I don't. The ray hope Blumenthal's book right-wingers talks tend psychologically unstable don't much staying power--think Ted Haggard. But numbers. The bad thing could take control. The defeat Sarah Palin, Conrad Burns (R-MT), George Allen (R- VA), Rick Santorum (R-PA), James Talent (R-MO), Mike DeWine (R-OH) brought us "back brink" according website Theocracy Watch. But back brink. The good thing would able maintain call government long (see George W. Bush). The bad thing would destroy country know trying. If I take long view, well, I think, Stalinism lasted 25 years, Nazism 12. The Iranian Mullahs 30 years. Russia Germany survived, Iran might, well. But generations lost places. And Stalin Hitler didn't nuclear weapons. I think 22-year-old clerk convenience store, looking barrel pistol. He probably idea killer sense agency, hardly even knew doing, seeing hand separate himself. But I feel sorry killer, too, subject feelings could label terrifying overpowering. I bet beaten, shamed, neglected child. I bet, afterward, wished someone, somehow, stopped him.
