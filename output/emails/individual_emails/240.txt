The Washington Post December 4, 2012 Tuesday Regional Edition SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A25 HEADLINE: It's Rice BYLINE: Richard Cohen BODY: In 1953, Army officer name Irving Peress promoted captain major. Peress leftist, possibly communist, word advancement rank reached Sen. Joseph McCarthy Washington. He asserted promotion proved Army "soft communism," launched investigation transfixed nation. Peress, way, mere dentist. He Susan Rice day. Rice, course, much substantial figure. She U.N. ambassador, friend Barack Obama's member Cabinet. Still, attack disproportionate accused done - it, exactly? - Peress case, conclude something work. At first, I thought witnessing another example Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) Rumpelstiltskin number - throwing fit stomping feet. It McCain first leveled solemn charge Rice lied Sunday TV shows attack U.S. consulate Benghazi, Libya. She characterized spontaneous riot was, fact, planned attack local al-Qaeda affiliate. But Rice hewing early line established intelligence community. If CIA others wrong - deceptive - so, inevitably, she. Just surely day follows night, McCain's broadside echoed Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). It soon taken 97 Republicans House found Rice unqualified become secretary state - post nominated. "Ambassador Rice widely viewed willfully incompetently misled American public," bellowed. I think Rice would make dandy secretary state. She's close president, matters great deal. But also seen overly political that, much version Benghazi, troubles others. Oddly enough, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), former presidential candidate another potential secretary state, seen much statesmen. He indeed independent foreign-policy thinker has, days old, restored prestige importance Foreign Relations Committee, chairman. But awful truth hardly matters Obama chooses. Foreign policy run White House State Department.

So fuss about? Not Rice, that's sure. It turned instead expression unease Obarna's foreign policy politicization. The unfortunate Peress came personify government's alleged indifference (equally alleged) communist infiltration military virtually everything else (with possible exception American Legion), Similarly, Rice become personification unhappiness use intelligence leaks buff Obanaa's foreign policy image conducting amorphous foreign policy. Like Churchill's famous pudding, lacks theme. Syria example. U.S. inaction allowed crisis fester. Bashar al-Assad's regime might dusting formidable arsenal chemical weapons, evidence chaotic crisis become, much time White House trailed Turkey France. The war spread, refugee calamity developed, 40,000 people died, jihadists come play prominent role. The Obarna administration lethargic Syria initially Libya. This sense aimless foreign policy, one lacking moral fervor (or fiber) irritates conservatives much liberals. It certainly enrages McCain, cannot stomach big guys kicking little guys around. He sees administration engage American people matters foreign policy - make case intervention, say it's hard do. The attack Rice unfair excessive. But issue person represents - case, administration's 'mobility articulate foreign policy marries American morality American power, merely American politics.
