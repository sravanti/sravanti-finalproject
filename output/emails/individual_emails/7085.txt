aned Woodward's Fire Leslie H. Gelb September 23, 2010 I 1:32pm The president team cooperated famed author's new book. Leslie H. Gelb fallout—and Obama's Wars shows U.S. stuck open-ended conflict. Lots White House officials observed Bob Woodward, Mr. First Draft History, repeatedly boldly slipping behind closed doors President Obama's intimate advisers. They knew happening. The president's men helping The Washington Post's sleuth write "the inside story" boss masterfully managed trying Herculean labors—the war Afghanistan. There's one big problem dealing Woodward manner: Once boss opens doors spilling secrets, many subordinates feel liberated "tell side story." By time exhausted tales heroism shortcomings fellow senior officials, well, one looks terribly heroic. Let's start Obama, emerges pages Obama's Wars is—brilliant, emotionless, abstract, focused, confused, Chicago law-school professor presidents' clothes. He obviously wanted Woodward portray brilliant intellectual leader government giving much help solving Afghan mystery, trudged on, best anyone possibly could terrible circumstances. The worst circumstance, Team Obama alleged Woodward, Pentagon leadership U.S. generals give real choices asking for. He wanted options troop increases below, even far below, generals giving him. He didn't get them. He wanted strategy U.S. forces would drawn reached projected peak 100,000 (more three times number George W. Bush left him). The military didn't provide that, either. As say Missouri, "Give break." If commander chief United States doesn't know get wants U.S. military, might want something that. And many generals White House picked guide might told go task. To cut chase: Obama didn't understand do—tell Defense Secretary Bob Gates tell generals either meet president's wishes fired. Republican presidents that. And so, Woodward describes, Obama write strategy himself. This still awful situation springs two sources. One president clear enough thinking objectives Afghanistan, military rest us must real clarity pursue wars. Woodward right. Here Obama quotes illustrate problem. The president told Woodward didn't think Afghan war "classic" terms U.S. winning losing. "I think terms of: Do successfully prosecute strategy results country stronger rather weaker end?" What earth mean? Or try one, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) whether July 2011 deadline begin withdrawal firm: "I say that. I can't let war without end, I can't lose whole Democratic Party." Does mean Obama really believes war, party doesn't? Or White House aides: "This needs plan we're going hand get Afghanistan." So, wanted plan, gotten plan. He president all. Which leads second problem: When president clear tough problem, military smells vacillations. And sure don't like vacillation comes dispatching men women war. Americans don't fathom well military mentality. The military countries throughout history doesn't like go war; like build arms overall strength. But war, want troops, fewer restrictions use, all, victory, victory, victory. Since Vietnam, smell vacillation among Democrats, don't like it. For part, Democrats see insubordination worse among military toward them, don't care suits either. It's happy circumstance. Woodward didn't explore underlying reality, critical Americans understand. breakAd The White House clash military could get worse latest news Gen. Stanley McChrystal's firing naughty things said White House reporter. According preliminary Army investigation, general—and perhaps even senior Army aides—were sources nasty quotes. It guys—you know, usual culprits, Navy civilians. There formal inquiries this, nothing good come them. There's another important thread running throughout Woodward account that, I believe, gets wrong right. That is, Woodward's repeated insistence open bitter policy brawls good old Situation Room (the inner sanctum White House meetings) Afghan policy. Mr. Instant Historian paints picture war all. My information always relative agreement major policy. Based sources, doubt Secretary State Hillary Clinton, Defense Secretary Bob Gates, Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen almost always quite cordial full lock step. They, along NSC Adviser Jim Jones field commanders like General McChrystal General Petraeus, key players. Of course, Vice President Joe Biden Chief Staff Rahm Emanuel regular critics policy heading. The generals lobby positions public—in advance presidential decisions. And that's big no-no. But standard, almost Obama's top advisers much. The day West Point speech last December, set firm date July 2011 begin unspecified U.S. troop withdrawals, almost advisers publicly stated maybe one didn't take date seriously, everything "conditions based." That group rebels included Gates Clinton. So, anything, Obama's top counselors less united—sometimes seemed going. Here Petraeus say Woodward subject goals, it's stunner: "You recognize also I don't think win war. I think keep fighting. It's little bit like Iraq, actually.... Yes, enormous progress Iraq. But still horrific attacks Iraq, stay vigilant. You stay it. This kind fight we're rest lives probably kids' lives." The brilliant general said much others last year. It's enough knock socks off. So far, heroes narrative, self-described heroic skeptics war warriors would fight forever. Doubtless, President Obama want fight open-ended war. He's sworn time again, I believe him, despite history calling "victory" "defeat" Taliban al Qaeda. But Woodward book demonstrates Obama team don't know get there. So far, heroes narrative, self-described heroic skeptics war warriors would fight forever. Leslie H.
