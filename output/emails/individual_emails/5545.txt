August 8, 2010 Gary Sick America Iran: Strikes, Sanctions Scapegoats For pundits, two questions U.S.-Iran relations importance: (1) Will Israel and/or United States attack Iran? (2) new sanctions enough bite persuade Iran change nuclear policy? Despite printers ink spilled two issues, answers easy no. Neither United States Israel take military option table, thereby giving pundits (and crowd dying repeat Iraq) latitude keep distant prospect military action front pages, years. As lede, sells columns newspapers, go away. But analysis either blinded momentary hype else simple wish fulfillment. Uber-neocon John Bolton right. If attack occur, would end Bush administration nothing left lose. Bolton thought inevitable predicted unequivocally Wall Street Journal column 2008. Dick Cheney apparently agreed, judging subsequent statements regret. So fair say George W. Bush, looking potential consequences, resisted advice neocon advisers, previously dominant vice president, reported direct request government Israel — rejected strike. What likelihood Barack Obama, catastrophic scenario him, approve? Forget it. Sanctions persuade dictatorial regimes abandon projects think central security survival even self-image. Just look Saddam Hussein. The international sanctions imposed Iraq 1980s make current Iran sanctions appear anemic comparison. Every item went Iraq subject approval UN committee dominated vindictive United States. Yet, although Iraq abandoned nuclear weapons program years earlier, Saddam could bring let people enemies know that. Instead prepared gamble United States would attack him. One reasons bad bet cronies well sanctions immediate necessity come clean. They, all, controlled smuggling routes. And henchmen managed thriving enormously lucrative black market. As concern people, rotund Tariq Aziz, sitting fine Scotch Cuban cigar, informed worried UN representative would good Iraqi people lose weight. An Iraqi friend mine told time sanctions made criminals entire Iraqi middle class, resort illegal behavior order survive. The biggest – successful – new criminal class privileged group immediately around Saddam Hussein. Which brings us Iran. The sanctions effective many anticipated. They built web financial restrictions limitations around already weak Iranian economy certain cause significant problems leadership. Iran's critical energy sector particularly vulnerable. It pincer. Because cheap energy prices inside country, artificially propped massive subsidies, energy demand soaring. This siphons lot Iran's oil production, would otherwise sold world market hard currency. At time, Iran's oil fields old complex, require modern technology maintain production. That technology – capital investment provided major international oil companies – absent many years. It driven away partly sanctions, ironically assisted Iran's short-sighted negotiating tactics offered meager profit margins outside investors. As result, Iran's oil production decline time soaked domestic consumption. In period relatively low oil prices, means Iran's hard currency earnings drying alarming rate. This unenviable economic situation compounded described perhaps least competent economic management team major country world. Ayatollah Khamene'i, Supreme Leader, seems totally preoccupied bolstering shaky political legitimacy pandering Revolutionary Guards surround protect him. The result corruption scale beyond anything shah's regime could imagined. President Ahmadinejad, also creature Revolutionary Guards, free indulge taste outlandish irresponsible rhetoric. His words keep international domestic spotlight glued him; effect drives away prospective investors facilitates U.S. drive enlist international support sanctions Iran. An American Jewish leader joked suspected Ahmadinejad Mossad agent: one, observed, helpful promoting donations Israel Israeli causes. At time, leadership Iran inflation unemployment double digits. But fair, Ahmadinejad first politician modern Iranian history willing address "third rail" Iranian politics — immensely costly subsidies food energy. His initial efforts reduce amount subsidized gasoline Iranians could use met outbursts indignation, including torching filling stations. But rules seem grudgingly accepted eased slightly Iran's energy dilemma. He addressing low tax rates assessed merchants. This also resulted outrage, including closing bazaars Iran major cities. But campaign seems making progress. These needed reforms would recommended responsible economic overseer, including International Monetary Fund. Ahmadinejad attempts balance daring assaults entrenched economic interests belligerent rhetoric, always casting champion little guy. In resembles populist predecessors, Juan Peron Huey Long Hugo Chavez. Ahmadinejad takes America Israel way Governor Long took Standard Oil. But like populists, Ahmadinejad prisoner eccentric view world loyalty lieutenants may may worthy faith them. The key question Iran today whether attacked collapse sanctions. It whether Iran capable present leadership take sober decision deal outside world. The Revolutionary Guards established dominant position Iran's military, economy, politics. Iran increasingly comes resemble corporatist states southern eastern Europe 1920s '30s call fascist. Iran conducting interior battle demons, millenarians far right choose believe Khamene'i personal representative God earth, pragmatic conservatives simply want responsible leadership, reformists Green movement whose objective put "republic" back Islamic Republic giving people greater voice. This yeasty unpredictable mix. No one knows going happen next. And reality Obama administration must deal with. The danger administration back wrong horse Iran. The real danger Obama administration preoccupied domestic American politics constant demand look tough dealing Iran inadvertently rescue cruel hapless regime ineptitude providing convenient scapegoat everything goes wrong Iran.
