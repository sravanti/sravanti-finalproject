sbwhoeop Saturday, March 20, 2010 5:54 PM H: fyi. sid H: Uri Avnery, Israeli analyst activist, privately circulating analysis today. One consequence: Petraeus cannot run Republican. At least Putin didn't bring big dogs like Merkel. Cheers, Sid Uri Avnery 20.3.10 The Doomsday Weapon IT IS already commonplace say people don't learn history condemned repeat mistakes. Some 1942 years ago, Jews province called Palaestina launched revolt Roman Empire. In retrospect, looks like act madness. Palestine small insignificant part world-wide empire won crushing victory rival power — Parthian Empire (Persia) — put major rebellion Britain. What chances could Jewish revolt have? God knows going mind "Zealots". They eliminated moderate leaders, warned provoking empire, gained sway Jewish population country. They relied God. Perhaps also relied Jews Rome believed influence Senate would restrain Emperor, Nero. Perhaps heard Nero weak fall. We know ended: three years, rebels crushed, Jerusalem fell temple burned down. The last Zealots committed suicide Masada. The Zionists indeed try learn history. They acted rational way, provoke great powers, endeavored every situation attain possible. They accepted compromises, every compromise served basis next surge forward. They cleverly utilized radical stance adversaries gained sympathy whole world. But since beginning occupation, mind become clouded. The cult Masada become dominant. Divine promises start play role public discourse. Large parts public following new zealots. The next phase also repeating itself: leaders Israel starting rebellion new Rome. WHAT BEGAN insult Vice President United States developing something far bigger. The mouse given birth elephant. Lately, ultra-right government Jerusalem started treat President Barack Obama thinly veiled contempt. The fears arose Jerusalem beginning term dissipated. Obama looks like paper black panther. He gave demand real settlement freeze. Every time spat on, remarked raining. Yet now, ostensibly quite suddenly, measure full. Obama, Vice President senior assistants condemn Netanyahu government growing severity. Secretary State Hillary Clinton submitted ultimatum: Netanyahu must stop settlement activity, East Jerusalem included; must agree negotiate core problems conflict, including East Jerusalem, more. The surprise complete. Obama, seems, crossed Rubicon, much Egyptian army crossed Suez Canal 1973. Netanyahu gave order mobilize reserves America move forward diplomatic tanks. All Jewish organizations US commanded join campaign. AIPAC blew shofar ordered soldiers, Senators Congressmen, storm White House. It seems decisive battle joined. The Israeli leaders certain Obama would defeated. And unusual noise heard: sound doomsday weapon. THE MAN decided activate foe new kind. David Petraeus popular officer United States army. The four-star general, son Dutch sea captain went America country overrun Nazis, stood early childhood. In West Point "distinguished cadet", Army Command General Staff College No. 1. As combat commander, reaped plaudits. He wrote doctoral thesis (on lessons Vietnam) Princeton served assistant professor international relations US Military Academy. He made mark Iraq, commanded forces Mosul, problematical city country. He concluded order vanquish enemies US must win hearts civilian population, acquire local allies spend money ammunition. The locals called King David. His success considered outstanding methods adopted official doctrine American army. His star rose rapidly. He appointed commander coalition forces Iraq soon became chief Central Command US army, covers whole Middle East , except Israel Palestine (which "belong" American command Europe). When person raises voice, American people listen. As respected military thinker, rivals. THIS WEEK, Petraeus conveyed unequivocal message: reviewing problems AOR (Area Of Responsibility) — includes, among others, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq Yemen — turned called "root causes instability" region. The list topped Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In report Armed Services Committee stated: "The enduring hostilities Israel neighbors present distinct challenges ability advance interests AOR...The conflict foments anti-American sentiment, due perception U.S. favoritism Israel. Arab anger Palestinian question limits strength depth U.S. partnerships governments peoples AOR weakens legitimacy moderate regimes Arab world. Meanwhile, al-Qaeda militant groups exploit anger mobilize support. The conflict also gives Iran influence Arab world clients, Lebanese Hizballah Hamas." Not content that, Petraeus sent officers present conclusions Joint Chiefs Staff, In words: Israeli-Palestinian peace private matter two parties, supreme national interest USA. That means US must give one-sided support Israeli government impose two-state solution. The argument new. Several experts said less past. (Immediately 9/11 attacks, I wrote similar vein prophesied US would change policy. It happen then.) But stated official document written responsible American commander. The Netanyahu government immediately went damage-limitation mode. Its spokespersons declared Petraeus represents narrow military approach, doesn't understand political matters, reasoning faulty. But made people Jerusalem break cold sweat. AS IS well known, pro-Israel lobby dominates American political system without limits — almost. Every American politician senior official mortally afraid it. The slightest deviation strict AIPAC line tantamount political suicide. But armor political Goliath chink. Like Achilles' heel, immense might pro-Israel lobby vulnerable point that, touched, neutralize power. It illustrated Jonathan Pollard affair. This American-Jewish employee sensitive intelligence agency spied Israel. Israelis consider national hero, Jew duty people. But US intelligence community, traitor endangered lives many American agents. Not satisfied routine penalty, induced court impose life sentence. Since then, American presidents refused requests successive Israeli governments commute sentence. No president dared confront intelligence chiefs matter. But significant side affair reminiscent famous words Sherlock Holmes dogs bark. AIPAC bark. The entire American Jewish community fell silent. Almost nobody raised voice poor Pollard. Why? Because American Jews ready anything — anything — government Israel. With one exception: anything appears hurt security United States. When flag security hoisted, Jews, like Americans, snap attention salute. The Damocles sword suspicion disloyalty hangs heads. For them, ultimate nightmare: accused putting security Israel ahead security US. Therefore important repeat endlessly mantra interests Israel US identical. And comes important general US Army says so. The policy present Israeli government endangering lives American soldiers Iraq Afghanistan. FOR NOW, said side remark, military document widely aired. But sword drawn scabbard - American Jews started tremble distant rumble approaching earthquake. This week, Netanyahu's brother-in-law used doomsday weapon. He declared Obama "anti-Semite". The official newspaper Shas party asserted Obama really Muslim. They represent radical right allies, argue speech writing "Hussein" Obama Jew-hating black must beaten coming congressional elections next presidential ones. (Yet important poll Israel published yesterday shows Israeli public far convinced insinuations: vast majority believes Obama's treatment Israel fair. Indeed, Obama got higher marks Netanyahu.) If Obama decides fight back activate doomsday weapon - accusation Israel puts lives American servicemen risk - would catastrophic consequences Israel. For time being, shot across bow - warning shot fired warship order induce another vessel follow instructions. The warning clear. Even •present crisis somehow damped down, inevitably flare long present coalition Israel stays power. When movie "Hurt Locker" won awards, entire American public united concern lives soldiers Middle East. If public becomes convinced Israel sticking knife back, disaster Netanyahu. And him.
