Leader Is Tightly Bound Lobbyists By ERIC LIPTON WASHINGTON — House Democrats preparing late last year first floor vote financial regulatory overhaul Representative John A. Boehner Ohio Republican leaders summoned 100 industry lobbyists Capitol Hill private strategy session. The bill's passage House already seemed inevitable. But Mr. Boehner deputies told Wall Street lobbyists trade association leaders teaming up, could still perhaps block final passage least water down. "We need get speak this," Mr. Boehner said December afternoon, according three people familiar remarks, also warning cutting side deals Democrats. That sort alliance — won skirmishes, though lost war regulatory bill — business usual Mr. Boehner, House minority leader would-be speaker Republicans win House November. He maintains especially tight ties circle lobbyists former aides representing nation's biggest businesses, including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R. J. Reynolds, MillerCoors UPS. They contributed hundreds thousands dollars campaigns years, provided rides corporate jets, socialized luxury golf resorts waterfront bashes leading fund-raising efforts Boehner Speaker campaign, soliciting checks $37,800 each, maximum allowed. Some lobbyists readily acknowledge routinely seeking office's help — calling congressman aides often several times week — advance agenda Washington. And many cases, Mr. Boehner helped out. As Democrats increasingly try cast Ohio congressman face Republican Party — President Obama mentioned name eight times speech last week — Mr. Boehner becomes visible, ties lobbyists, cultivated since arrived 1991, coming attack. The woman hopes replace, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, derided Friday met "countless times special-interest lobbyists effort stop tough legislation" would regulate corporations protect consumers. And Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, spokeswoman, charged "epitomizes smoked-filled, backroom, special-interest deal making turns voters Washington." Mr. Boehner, declined interviewed article, lobbyist allies ridicule criticism politically motivated desperate Democrats. His actions, say, simply reflect pro-business, antiregulatory philosophy espoused three decades, dating back Mr. Boehner, son tavern owner, ran small plastics company Ohio. And fielding requests lobbyists nothing unusual, says. "I get lobbied every day somebody," said last month speech Cleveland. "It could wife. It could bellman. It goes day, everyday, everyplace." Mr. Boehner — 60-year-old, perpetually tanned, sharply tailored, chain-smoking golfer — fiery Newt Gingrich unrelenting arm-twister Tom DeLay, two Republican predecessors top House posts. It reputation "Chamber Commerce" Republican fund-raising skills — raised $36 million Republican causes election cycle, almost anyone else party — explain, part, rise. If elected party's leader House, Mr. Boehner certainly lean industry allies help builds coalitions necessary push legislation Congress, office acknowledges. His friends say nothing wrong that. "Does lot relationships city? Yes, absolutely," said Mark lsakowitz, friend whose Republican firm represents three dozen financial, telecommunications, energy consumer products companies diverse Coca-Cola Zurich Financial Services. "But I think good lawmakers do." Mr. Boehner won first national headlines back 1996 caught handing checks tobacco lobbyists fellow Republicans House floor. Then fourth-ranking House Republican, Mr. Boehner said broken rules simply assisting lobbyist friends, contributing Republicans' campaigns. His business-friendly reputation enhanced weekly powwows organized Capitol Hill nicknamed Thursday Group, gathering conservative leaders business lobbyists relied help push party's legislative agenda. The Thursday gathering disbanded Republican power struggle cost leadership position. But continued routinely meet business leaders, particularly role chairman Education Workforce Committee, returned power House G.O.P. leader 2006. Several onetime Thursday regulars, along newcomers, among close-knit group routinely call Mr. Boehner's office client matters, write checks campaign socialize him. That tight circle includes Mr. lsakowitz; Bruce Gates, lobbyist cigarette maker Altria; Nicholas E. Calio, Citigroup lobbyist; two former aides, Marc Lampkin Sam Geduldig, financial services lobbyists. The tobacco industry particularly well represented, Mr. Gates John Fish, lobbyist R. J. Reynolds, maker Camel cigarettes, group. People affiliated companies contributed least $340,000 Mr. Boehner's political campaigns, Mr. Gates top individual donor among thousands Mr. Boehner's political career, according tally Center Public Integrity. While many lawmakers party networks donors, lobbyists former aides represent corporate interests, Mr. Boehner's ties seem especially deep. His clique even nickname Capitol Hill, Boehner Land. The members inner circle said association Mr. Boehner translates open access staff. "He likes bring similarly minded people together try advance legislation oppose it," said Drew Maloney, lobbyist Ogilvy Government Relations. "That get things done." One lobbyist club — lauding staff member Mr. Boehner's office routinely calls ask help — ticked list recent issues won lawmaker's backing: combating fee increases oil industry, fighting proposed cap debit card fees, protecting tax breaks hedge fund executives opposing cap greenhouse gas emissions. Still, Mr. Boehner party minority, often lost fights. But despite recent string defeats House floor, Mr. Boehner benefited alliance lobbyists. From 2000 2007, Mr. Boehner flew least 45 times, often wife, Debbie, corporate jets provided companies including R. J. Reynolds. (As required, Mr. Boehner reimbursed part costs.) In addition, last decade, taken 41 trips paid corporate sponsors industry groups, often popular golf spots. Those trips make one top House beneficiaries travel, recently curbed result changes ethics rules Washington. Mr. Boehner continues travel popular golf destinations corporate-subsidized tab, although paid political action committee, Freedom Project. In last 18 months, spent least $67,000 Ritz Carlton Naples Florida, least $20,000 Robert Trent Jones Golf Club Gainesville, Va., least $29,000 Muirfield Village Golf Club Dublin, Ohio, federal records show, fund-raising events. In June, prospects Republican takeover House rising, Mr. Boehner moved accelerate fund- raising effort, starting called Boehner Speaker campaign. The idea use high profile draw large donations would mostly allocated help elect House Republicans. He turned group lobbyists, former aides friends July meeting headquarters Republican National Committee. "The wave there, rebellion country, good candidates," Mr. Boehner told supporters, one lobbyists present meeting recalled. "But I don't want miss once-in-a-lifetime opportunity raised enough money. They might able stop us wall money." Mr. Calio Citigroup among first write large check. So far, party spokesman said, campaign raised nearly $2 million. Mr. Boehner helped raise millions last six weeks Republican House candidates across country party, appearing 40 fund-raisers. The Boehner Speaker campaign offers donors give maximum amount special perks, like "meetings Leader Boehner much much more." But lobbyist friends former aides said incentives mean much, already plenty access Mr. Boehner. They want see speaker House. "He knows going tough election," said Samuel J. Baptista, friend, golf partner lobbyist whose clients include Goldman Sachs Discover Financial. "But people underestimate really peril."
