Cc: Berger, Samuel R. HRC: I wasn't satisfied answer question gain leverage Pakistanis move aggressively pursue AQ. I've thought and, I silver bullet, thoughts. -- My impression Pakistanis cooperative lately assisting us target AQ Pakistan that, hold back, less function affinity toward AQ AQ imbedded.. -- In particular, seem reluctant target AQ nestled groups want cultivate event "leave" Afghanistan need influence there. They seen hedge bets. -- So first point address reason holding back. If disabuse perception leaving Afghanistan, easier get Pakistanis go AQ sanctuaries provided groups would part future Afghanistan dominated Taliban. -- Second, I believe coercive measures likely effective targeted military leaders give support AQ allies. Assuming adequate intelligence, go bank accounts, travel reachable assets individual Pakistani officers, raising stakes supporting militants without creating inordinate backlash . Blunter measures coercion, like conditioning assistance, likely counterproductive. Given level distrust us among Pakistani people, would see another sharp swing U.S. pendulum would harden attitudes make greater cooperation difficult Pakistani people accept. -- There may greater leverage giving Pakistanis incentives aggressive. Of course, military's calculation important. I'm sure shopping list days would need balance would move needle AQ undercutting effort get shift strategic focus away India. . At time, forward leaning possible support counterinsurgency capabilities (equipment, training, whatever material, intelligence assistance give move Wazeristan -- including relief displaced persons). If finally take step, possible demonstrate arrows aligned theirs.. -- On civilian side, desire greater control Kerry-Lugar money used played strategic advantage. If give greater sense directing use funds -- without greatly undercutting effectiveness -- strengthens position press AQ. -- Finally, defining relationship India. Are measures Indians could take would reduce Pakistani anxieties Indian front thus better enable focus threats East, including AQ anti-Indian militant groups like LET? Are confidence building measures information sharing troop movements would reduce uncertainty support Pakistani public narrative shift emphasis India militancy? To extent India seeks Pakistan move vigorously militants, could see steps advancing interests. This tricky territory may worth pursuing. Sandy
