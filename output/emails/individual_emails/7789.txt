They are, judge WikiLeaks dump quarter-million private secret cables, thoughtful, well-informed dedicated servants American interest write clear, declarative English sentences. I've heard much torrent Wiki-chatter admirable career diplomats whose diplomacy condemned unquiet. Yet whose lives upturned. Every journalist knows correspondence several years suddenly made public, would lose sources. That give every journalist pause. So front line U.S. diplomacy. Contacts self-censor. They go quiet, particularly conspiratorial parts world also tend unstable, like Middle East. Layers secrecy added. Julian Assange, thin-skinned founder WikiLeaks, hurt U.S. interests across broad probably shallow spectrum. That satisfy he's self-styled foe United States. The guy makes queasy. Perhaps shocking thing Assange treasure trove — beyond "shock" venal Gulf Arab Sunni leaders looking war cheap Shiite Iran long doesn't disrupt U.S.-armed fiefdoms; "shock" Pakistani double-dealing nuclear procrastination; "shock" yet premature Israeli predictions Iran nuclear weapon; "shock" continued Saudi funding Al Qaeda; "shock" Chinese Politburo hacking Google; "shock" Muammar el-Qaddafi's taste voluptuous Slavic women Silvio Berlusconi's taste women — perhaps biggest shock professional, sober short embarrassment cables much conform world already knew it, right familiar adjectives evoking French President Nicolas Sarkozy: "hyperactive," "mercurial," "authoritarian," "erratic," "monarch-like." I swear, hadn't become diplomats lot State Department people could become good hacks. Overall, longstanding admiration America's conscientious diplomats redoubled, least underreported nugget turbulent Iranian election 2009, contained cable Jan. 12, 2010, Dubai: "While don't know might ever know real June 12 vote count, clear turnout record high levels systematic vote count fraud (if fact votes even counted) ensure Ahmadinejad 'won big' first round." It good know innermost conviction American diplomacy: fraud evident anyone Tehran election violent aftermath. A couple observations Iran: The first Sunni autocrats Gulf exercised Tehran part know U.S.-Iranian breakthrough might make dispensable United States. Their vested interest prevailing Middle Eastern strategic equation strong; nothing would redraw Middle East overcoming U.S.-Iranian psychosis. The second President Barack Obama's approach Iran much conventional initial outreach suggested. Old habits attempted coercion trumped originality. Very quickly fell back Dennis Ross's tired thinking balancing "appetizing carrots" "sharp sticks" tackling Iran's nuclear program. The cables reveal early March 2009, senior U.S. diplomat talking "dual track," telling Europeans "engagement alone unlikely succeed" calling added "pressure." Perhaps Iranian skepticism could never overcome; certainly approach guaranteed longstanding Iranian grievances would fester. Assange clearly understands nothing Iran Middle East diplomacy. In interview Time, expressed approval Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "coming interesting statement leaders speak public like private whenever can" bought Netanyahu's view this, Assange's words, would "lead kind increase peace process Middle East particularly relation Iran. It Huh? Netanyahu referring Arab leaders' now-documented private calls U.S.-led war Iran, option also favors. And that, Assange, step forward peace! He's place. What make brainy naïf told colleague John Burns America threat democracy? He's loose canon; let be. My impression he's self-armed spade he's digging. And messenger's message? The cables intriguing, offering plenty voyeuristic titillation gasp discovery. They provide texture break little new ground. Yet publication done significant damage courageous work America's diplomats may endanger lives. That's tradeoff I find troubling unpersuasive.
