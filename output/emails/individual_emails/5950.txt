PIR <preines Thursday, September 2, 2010 6:33 PM H CDM; Huma Abedin; Lona Valmoro; Jake Sullivan Joint Interview MS â€” Jake relayed yoLir desire cancel tomorrow's interview. But I want make sure aware things position share: 1) The Israeli & Palestinian interviewers teams skipped returning home today principals great cost energy order stay extra day you. One skipped traveling onward Abbas. 2) Both Israeli & Palestinian media outlets involved immediately announced joint interview hyping unprecedented nature 3) Because #2, U.S. media fully aware interview scheduled tomorrow morning. So three points: 1) There incredibly high expectation interview occurring canceling, matter reason cited, taken mean something negative2) The point interview shape narrative coming today, canceling contribute negative narrative canceling important figure Israeli media, I see Channel 2 taking well3) As positive symbolism interview meant be, run risk negative symbolism canceling. Typically want cancel something I roll it. But I want strenuously object case. I understand told participants refrain public comment, first, doesn't mean second, know won't really refrain. And I certain appreciate effusive things say interview. Not mention reason canceling something could foreseen going far road, - I don't think fair reflects well you. Lastly, much practical note: get I going bribe Channel 2 significant exclusive interview Jerusalem two weeks, I guarantee far painful tomorrow's relative short peaceful format. If you'd like discuss I'm desk available call Ops.
