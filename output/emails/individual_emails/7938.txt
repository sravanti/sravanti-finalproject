THE NBC/YORKER December 14, 2010 The Envoy Posted Hendrik Hertzberg Last night, I unlocking bike windswept Greenwich Village sidewalk leaving holiday party, friend approached, cell phone hand. A minutes earlier, I inside, chatting happily amid buzz warmth holiday party. Now tears eyes. "Richard Holbrooke died," said. Notwithstanding hospital bulletins since fell ill Saturday—critical condition, damaged aorta, emergency surgery—this sudden, awful ending shock, Richard Holbrooke astounding volcano vitality. Everything large: physical size, including ultimate "in face" face, face like Times Square billboard; buzz-saw voice, highly expressive instrument, equally adept piano (a side-of-the-mouth, gossipy wisecrack, often pleasingly nasty) forte (a high-decibel outburst anger indignation, almost always calculated effect); appetites (for experience, danger, praise, power, fun); ambitions (for himself, beliefs, United States, world). He doe-eyed peacenik, diplomat labored long hard seek alternatives war ways end particular wars. He sentimental unsentimentality, romantic tough-guy realism. Unlike tearful informant, known Holbrooke family friend since little girl, I acquainted casual way many journalists editors. He peer well "source," prolific forceful writer whose favorite venues, The New Republic The New Yorker, happened places I've spent working life. He gregarious fond big, splashy black-tie evenings. The last time I saw six weeks ago, November 1st, New York Public Library's "Literary Lions" celebration. At pre-dinner reception, would normally feet, looming large, repaired folding chair behind little table let wife, Kati Marton, bring party him. At sixty-nine tired—that much obvious—but sharp voluble ever. He still plenty do. Not long Holbrooke achieved greatest diplomatic triumph negotiating 1995 end Balkan wars, I asked liked Warren Zevon's wonderful song "The Envoy." He said he'd never heard it. The next day I sent CD. After that, mentioned every single time I've seen him, including NYPL gala, saying puts on, loud, needs lift. And wonder: life drama, liked way. If Supreme Court allowed votes counted 2000, Envoy, almost certainly, would become Secretary State, next decade would unfolded differently. As is, Holbrooke left stronger, positive, creative mark history held post. He certainly die broken heart—Kati Marton saw that—but surely ghastly, impossible demands last, impossible assignment brought rending aorta. He died country surely soldier. And deathbed words may turn important ever spoke.
