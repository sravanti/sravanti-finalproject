November 16, 2009 http://www.cfr.org/publication/20757/uschina_economic_relationship.html?breadcrumb=Â°/02Fregion%2F271%2Fchina Many myths surround economic relationship United States China. Four, particular, stand out, important identify myths avoid misunderstandings could adversely influence policy decisions. The fact China become largest foreign holder U.S. government securities taken indicating United States heavily dependent China finance budget deficits. Similarly, since China major source U.S. imports, U.S. consumers seen dependent cheap Chinese goods. In addition, Chinese authorities emphasized strongly resist external pressures try influence policy decisions economic instability China bad, adverse implications rest world. Taken together, four myths could lead conclusion China pushed hard United States (or major countries) quickly change policies, especially exchange rate policy, facilitate rebalancing economy. But conclusion would major mistake, trip Asia, President Barack Obama needs dispel myths bring pressure bear faster economic policy changes China. This would keeping objectives dealing global imbalances laid G-20 summit Pittsburgh September 2009. Myth No. 1: Washington limited leverage China main "banker" United States China holds large amount U.S. government securities. Of China's $2.3 trillion official reserves, estimated 70 percent held U.S. dollar assets. China big customer U.S. debt, America's banker. Nor United States dependent China finance budget deficits. If China elects buy U.S. Treasuries, willing public private sector buyers, indicated strong demand securities worldwide. Although U.S. government might pay higher interest rates incentive get investors buy Treasuries event Chinese reduce demand, increase interest rates would likely small. Major consequences decision China reduce purchases U.S. Treasury securities would depend reason behind decision. It would China's best interest (and beneficial rest world well) China reduced purchases U.S. Treasuries decided stop heavily managing exchange rate allow greater flexibility currency's movements. This important policy change required China going rebalance economy able sustain rapid growth. China big customer U.S. debt, America's banker. Nor United States dependent China finance budget deficits. If instead China continues heavily manage exchange rate, build large additional amounts official reserves. If decides hold less additional reserves U.S. Treasury securities, China increase purchases assets denominated currencies, euro-denominated securities likely alternative. In circumstances, China would continue intervene exchange market, central bank buying U.S. dollars Chinese renminbi selling dollars euro acquire European assets. The result would appreciation euro. Consequently, countries Europe, United States, would probably affected China's move negative impact euro appreciation European economic activity would likely far outweigh effects United States smaller Chinese purchases Treasuries. Alternatively, China could choose start dumping stock U.S. securities. The result would appreciation major currencies (depending China would decide park reserve assets); upward pressure U.S. interest rates; possibility financial market disruptions China dumped U.S. dollar assets rapidly. However, U.S. Federal Reserve could limit rise U.S. interest rates would able ensure adequate liquidity prevent market disruptions. But decision dump Treasuries would large effect China itself. The country would incur substantial capital loss reserve assets. The Chinese authorities deeply concerned loss, unlikely decide dump U.S. assets. In fact, discussion initiated China regarding need alternative official reserve asset motivated concerns potential losses U.S. dollar holdings. Myth No. 2: The United States heavily dependent cheap Chinese goods This really true. Only roughly 15 percent U.S. imports come China. Moreover, basic types manufactured consumer goods China exports United States (clothing, textiles, footwear, toys, small appliances, etc.) imported countries could produced domestically. The prices goods could substitute products China would higher, difference costs would relatively small. Competition among producers become fiercer, result cost differentials goods China suppliers narrowing. Dependence actually runs way. China highly dependent U.S. demand products. Economic growth China heavily dependent exports. Although China able achieve 8 percent GDP growth target 2009 owing stimulus domestic demand provided government policy actions, country struggle meet objective 2010 succeeding years demand exports United States pick up. Myth No. 3: External pressure China policy changes counterproductive. The Chinese authorities stress face external pressure, tend strongly resist economic policy changes. The Chinese particular used argument try fend pressures appreciation exchange rate. While country wants appear weak susceptible external pressure, truth that, pressure, less incentive change policy. This especially true China, authorities wedded status quo past success inclined make gradual changes economic policies. Recent developments China's exchange rate illustrate point. In absence external pressure since August 2008, China reverted fixing exchange rate relative U.S. dollar. Without hard push United States bilateral multilateral basis, changes China's policies likely delayed, best interest United States rest world. Myth No. 4: Instability bad China Chinese authorities also suggested instability China bad rest world adverse effects China's growth rate. But instability (or fear instability) played big role initiating economic policy changes China. For example, concern instability arising growing gap urban rural incomes major factor behind new initiatives develop China's interior (such Develop West program) improve conditions opportunities rural population (including breaking restrictions discriminatory treatment migrant workers). Hence, China, instability necessarily bad, problem authorities. Instability China also necessarily bad rest world effect China's growth. Although China accounts significant portion world GDP growth, country generate much demand products countries given China's large trade current account surpluses. Some countries Asia commodity producers may benefiting China's strong growth, overall, providing much stimulus world economy whole, slower growth China little effect economic activity rest world. It important President Obama separate fact myth economic policy discussions Chinese authorities trip Asia build sounder relationship. The president shy away pushing Chinese hard economic reform rebalancing China's economy, done private discussions China's senior leaders. Multilateral discussions, context G-20 process, much effective forum United States take public stance China's economic policies jointly major economies. Without hard push United States bilateral multilateral basis, changes China's policies likely delayed, best interest United States rest world. It also best interest China, without shift away heavy dependence investment exports drive growth toward greater reliance consumption, China able sustain rapid economic growth development. Getting China fully realize act quickly authorities inclined considerable task United States major economies.
