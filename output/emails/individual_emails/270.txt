Gene closer action I defer latest Jail-ian thinking machinations vis-a-vis cabinet INC. I hadn't heard ENI-related corruption wouldn't surprised. On federalism issue,. Jail right concerned eastern agitation autonomy. A cabinet chance won't solve problem, though. Nor recruiting Belhaj Islamist fighters take Bardans. To contrary, would lead unwanted bloodshed - large Obeid tribe still nurses serious grudge Belhaj ilk Islamists' presumed role killing beloved Gen. Yunis last July would probably put fierce fight. The cabinet INC need serious discussion Bargans - aren't already - power resources distributed new Libya. The Libyans held similarly heated debates topic early1950s held first parliamentary elections drafted constitution (there actually violent skirmishes connection elections, Washington delayed arrival first US ambassador things calmed down). Hopefully current leadership negotiate issues peaceably corning months. Of course, UN partners encourage so. - Chris SBU This email UNCLASSIFIED, From; Sullivan, Jacob Sent: Monday, April 23, 2012 5:31 PM To: Stevens, John C; Cr, Gene A; Feltman, Jeffrey D Subject Latest HRC friend U.S. Department State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739878 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.
