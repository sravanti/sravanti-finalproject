It prepared context language US might use articulate principles, principles parties might agree, provides language used past, citations. The USIP Middle East group Steve I chair decided rather issue static report, would prepare/commission series timely specific papers would provide privately Administration. (I sent office). They include papers security, Palestinian institution building, public attitudes Israel territories, etc. I deliver set papers office Monday If would useful, I would happy convene small, private discussion sharpest people group, give names. A observations following call am.: (1) This (a Framework Agreement) difficult I don't think impossible. If Bibi say secured unprecedented commitments security established principle Jewish state, could decide play historic leader. If uncompromising, deal consequences US-Israeli relations. His opt out, course, blame Pais, "in room". (2) I think negotiation goes principle paper rather way around, i.e. early exchange documents dig side positions. The two leaders need feel first level first principles, distilled period U.S. (3) Not sure need every meeting.. Ultimately, need establish trust. But (you Mitchell) need present enough make sure misunderstanding agreed, move things along. . (4) On critical issue security, I don't think Israelis trust NATO stand firm. They expect IDF presence Jordan Valley time. Palestinians recognize transitional phase. Question long. (5) As know, Abbas' position crumbling. Based conversation recently, I think genuinely committed agreement. He hopes that, fails, Bibi seem unreasonable. And event, I expect resign. His minimal requirement equivalent 1967. This tricky business, I don't think responsible choice make effort. It highest form statesmanship try. I leaving Monday foreign travel reached office -- Laura Huber Sandy
