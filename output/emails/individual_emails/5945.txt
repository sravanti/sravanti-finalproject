America's Faltering Search Peace Middle East: Openings Others? Remarks staff Royal Norwegian Ministry Foreign Affairs and, separately, members Norwegian Institute International Affairs Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.) 1 September 2010, Oslo, Norway You asked speak current American policies Middle East, emphasis prospects peace Holy Land. You suggested I touch relationship Gulf Arabs, especially Saudi Arabia, this. It honor challenge address subject capital / ministry. The declaration principles worked Oslo seventeen years ago last direct negotiation Israelis Palestinian Arabs reach consequential, positive results. The Oslo accords real step toward peace, another deceptive pseudo-event endlessly unproductive, so-called "peace process." And one step forward Oslo 1993 followed several steps backwards, great deal learned happened. There doubt importance today's topic. The ongoing conflict Holy Land increasingly disturbs world's conscience well tranquility. The Israel-Palestine issue began struggle context European colonialism. In post-colonial era, tension Israelis Palestinians dispossessed became, degrees, principal source radicalization instability Arab East Arab world whole. It stimulated escalating terrorism Israelis home allies abroad. Since end Cold War, interaction Israel captive Palestinian population emerged fountainhead global strife. It increasingly difficult distinguish strife war religions conflict civilizations. For better ill, country, United States played continues play key international part contest. American policies, external actor, capacity stoke stifle hatreds Middle East spread reverse infection wider world. American policies actions Middle East thus affect much region. Yet, I argue, United States obsessed process rather substance. It failed involve parties essential peace. It acted Israel's behalf preempt rather enlist international regional support peace. It defined issues ways preclude rather promote progress. Its concept "peace process" therefore become handmaiden Israeli expansionism rather driver peace. There alternatives tomorrow's diplomatic peace pageant Potomac. And, Norway shown, role powers America crafting peace Holy Land. Over thirty years ago, Camp David, Jimmy Carter pushed Israel door peace Egypt's Anwar Sadat opened. Twenty years ago, first Bush administration pressed Israel negotiating table Palestinian leaders, setting stage clandestine meetings Oslo. The capacity United States rally governments behind cause espouses may atrophied, American power remains far greater nation. Nowhere evident Middle East. For four decades, Israel able rely aid United States dominate region militarily sustain economic prosperity. It counted leverage American politics block application international law protect political repercussions policies actions. Unquestioning American support enabled Israel put seizure ever land ahead achievement modus vivendi Palestinians Arabs. Neither violent resistance dispossessed objections abroad brought successive Israeli governments question, let alone alter priority assign land peace. Ironically, Palestinians developed dependency relationship America. This locked political framework Israel exercises decisive influence. They powerless end occupation, pogroms, ethnic cleansing, humiliations Jewish soldiers settlers. Nor able prevent progressive confinement checkpoint-encircled ghettos West Bank great open-air prison Gaza. Despite appalling record failure, American monopoly management search peace Palestine remains unchallenged. Since end Cold War, Russia — contender countervailing influence region — lapsed impotence. The former colonial powers European Union, earlier laid basis conflict region, largely sat hands ringing them, content let America take lead. China, India, Asian powers prudently kept political military distance. In region itself, Iran postured exploited Palestinian cause without anything advance it. Until recently, Turkey remained aloof. On rare occasions, case 1973 Arab oil embargo, Arabs backed verbal opposition Israel action. Egypt Jordan settled unpopular coexistence Israel sustained U.S. subventions. Saudi Arabia twice taken initiative offer Israel diplomatic concessions conclude arrangements peaceful coexistence Palestinians. But, overall, Arab governments earned contempt Palestinians people lack serious engagement. For part, Arab leaders timorously demanded America solve Israel-Palestine problem them, obsequiously courting American protection Israel, other, Iran, — cases — increasingly frustrated angry subjects citizens. Islam charges rulers duty defend faithful uphold justice. It demands embody righteousness. The resentment mostly Muslim Arabs governing elites' failure meet standards generates sympathy terrorism directed Israel United States Arab governments associated it. The perpetrators September 11, 2001, terrorist attack United States saw part reprisal American complicity Israeli cruelties Palestinians Arabs. They justified strike Washington's protection Arab governments willing overlook American contributions Muslim suffering. Washington's response attack included suspending efforts make peace Holy Land well invading occupying Afghanistan Iraq. All three actions inadvertently strengthened terrorist case attacks America allies. The armed struggle Americans Muslim radicals already spilled Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, countries. Authoritative voices Israel call adding Iran list countries war America. They echoed Zionist neo-conservative spokesmen United States, The widening involvement Americans combat Muslim lands inflamed anti-American passions catalyzed metastasis terrorism. It caused growing majority world's 1.6 billion Muslims see United States menace faith, way life, homelands, personal security. American populists European xenophobes meanwhile undercut liberal centrist Muslim arguments intolerance empowers terrorism equating terrorism extremist advocates Islam followers. The current outburst bigoted demagoguery construction Islamic cultural center mosque New York merely recent illustration this. It suggests blatant racism Islamophobia contemporary Israeli politics contagious. It rules global alliances religious extremists essential encompass political defeat. President Obama's inability break pattern must enormous personal disappointment him. He came office committed crafting new relationship Arab Muslim worlds. His first interview international media Arab satellite television. He reached publicly privately Iran. He addressed Turkish parliament persuasive empathy. He traveled great center Islamic learning Cairo deliver remarkably eloquent message conciliation Muslims everywhere. He made clear understood centrality injustices Holy Land Muslim estrangement West. He promised responsible withdrawal Iraq judicious recrafting strategy Afghanistan. Few doubt Mr. Obama's sincerity. Yet none initiatives led policy change anyone detect, let alone believe It analyze explain wide gaps rhetoric achievement Obama Administration's stewardship many aspects country's affairs. American voters render first formal verdict two months tomorrow, 2nd November. The situation Holy Land, Iraq, Afghanistan, adjacent areas part consider so. But I think worthwhile briefly examine changes situation ensure many policies helped us get Middle East longer this. Let begin "peace process," hardy perennial America's diplomatic repertoire Obama Administration put back public display tomorrow. In Cold War, appearance earnest "even- handed" American search peace Holy Land price U.S. access influence Middle East. It provided political cover conservative Arab governments set aside anger American backing Israel stand America Western bloc Soviet Communism. It kept American relations Israel Arabs becoming zero-sum game. It mobilized domestic Jewish support incumbent presidents. Of course, hasn't American-led "peace process" Middle East least decade. Still conceit "peace process" became essential political convenience concerned. No one could bear admit "peace process" expired. It therefore lived phantom form. Even "peace process," possibility resurrecting one provided hope gullible, cover guileful, beguilement press, excuse nothing gaining status quo, — last far least — lifetime employment career "peace processors." The perpetual processing peace without requirement produce especially appreciated Israeli leaders. It enabled behave like magicians, riveting foreign attention meaningless distractions systematically removed Palestinians homes, settled half million Jews newly vacated areas occupied territories, annexed widening swath land Jerusalem insist belongs Israel. Palestinian leaders legitimacy problems also reason collaborate search "peace process." It's obviously better way end people's suffering. Playing "peace process" charades justifies international patronage Israeli backing leaders need retain status occupied territories. It ensures media access high-level visiting rights Washington. Meanwhile, American leaders, engagement sort Middle East "peace process" essential credibility Arab Islamic worlds, well ever-generous American Jewish community. Polls show American Jews impatient peace. Despite evidence contrary, eager believe willingness government Israel trade land it. Previous "peace processes" exploited impulses. In practice, however, diplomatic distractions served obscure Israeli actions evasions often prejudicial peace helpful achieving it. Behind blather, rumble bulldozers never stopped. Given history, taken year half relentless effort U.S. Special Envoy George Mitchell persuade parties even meet directly talk talks first Oslo, seventeen years ago. When curtain goes diplomatic show Washington tomorrow, players put different skit? There many reasons doubt will. One Obama administration engaged aging impresarios staged previously failed "peace processes" produce direct one agreed script. The last time guys staged ill- prepared meeting, Camp David 2000, cost heads delegation, Ehud Barak Yasser Arafat, political authority. It led peace escalating violence. The parties showing time minimize President Obama's political embarrassment advance midterm elections United States, address agenda — still less address other's agendas. These indeed difficulties. But problems latest — possibly final — iteration perpetually ineffectual "peace process" fundamental. The Likud Party charter flatly rejects establishment Palestinian Arab state west Jordan River stipulates that: "The Palestinians run lives freely framework self-rule, independent sovereign state." This Israeli government committed charter well Jewish holy war land Palestine. It interest trading land covets peace might thwart territorial expansion. It considers unbound applicable UN resolutions, agreements past peace talks, "Roadmap," premise "two-state solution." The Palestinians desperate dignity security end Israeli occupation provide. But authority Palestinian negotiators negotiate rests recognition Israel United States, standing occupied territories, Gaza, Palestinian diaspora. Fatah ruling faction part Palestine. Its authority govern repudiated voters last Palestinian elections. The Mahmoud Abbas administration retains power grace Israeli occupation authorities United States, prefer government empowered Palestinian people polls. Mr. Abbas's constitutional term office long since expired. He presides parliament whose influential members locked Israeli jails. It clear he, faction, administration speak. So talks begin tomorrow promise case disinterested going motions negotiating mandate-less. The parties talks seek mollify America severely lessened international credibility. The United States government borrow modest reputations objectivity others — EU, Russia, UN — able convene discussion. It held auspices American president publicly humiliated Israel's prime minister issue center Israel-Palestine dispute — Israel's continuing seizure colonization Arab land. Vague promises Palestinian state within year waft air. But "peace process" always sneered deadlines, even much, much firmer ones. A definitive promise independent Palestine within year made Annapolis three years ago. Analogous promises Palestinian self-determination preceded resulted previous meetings decades, beginning Camp David accords 1979. Many audience recall five-year deadline fixed Oslo. The talks talks begin tomorrow yield concrete results international community prepared time insist one-year deadline put forward recognizing Palestinian state. Even peace unless long-neglected issues addressed. Peace pattern stability acceptable capacity disturb violence. It almost impossible impose. It cannot become reality, still less sustained, must accept excluded it. This reality directs attention gathering Washington must done remedy problems absences create. Obviously, party won democratically expressed mandate Palestinian people represent — Hamas — there. Yet peace without buy-in. Egypt Jordan invited observers. Yet nothing add separate peace agreements long ago made Israel. (Both agreements explicitly premised grudging Israeli undertakings accept Palestinian self-determination. The Jewish state quickly finessed both.) Activists Jewish diaspora disproportionately staff American delegation. A failure reconcile either American Jews Palestine diaspora peace would doom accord. But Palestinian diaspora represented Washington tenuous theory, fact. Other Arabs, including Arab League author peace initiative, Saudi Arabia, talks tomorrow. The reasons simple complex. At one level reflect conviction latest installment "peace process" another long series public entertainments American electorate also lack confidence authenticity Palestinian delegation. At another level, result way United States defined problems solved indifference Arab interests views definition evidences. Then too, reflect disconnects political culture negotiating style Israelis, Arabs, Americans. To begin with, neither Israel conveners proposed new "peace process" officially acknowledged responded Arab peace initiative 2002. This offered normalization relations Jewish state, Israel make peace Palestinians. Instead, United States Quartet seemed pocket Arab offer, ignore precondition Israelis come terms Palestinians, gone levy new demands. In connection, making Arab recognition Israel's "right exist" central purpose "peace process" offends Arabs many levels. In framing issue way, Israel United States appear asking something well beyond pragmatic accommodation reality Jewish state Middle East. To Arabs, Americans seem insisting Arab endorsement idea state Israel, means state established, manner comported itself. Must Arabs really embrace Zionism Israel cease expansion accept peace? Arabs Muslims familiar European history accept European anti-Semitism justified establishment homeland traumatized European Jews. But asking even implicitly agree forcible eviction Palestinian Arabs morally appropriate means end nonstarter seriously off-putting. So asking affirm resistance displacement sinful. Similarly, Arabs see demand recognize Jewish state fixed borders clever attempt extract endorsement Israel's unilateral expansion Palestinian expense. The lack appeal approach compounded longstanding American habit treating Arab concerns Israel form anti-Semitism tuning out. Instead hearing addressing Arab views, U.S. peace processors repeatedly focused soliciting Arab acts kindness toward Israel. They argue gestures acceptance help Israelis overcome Holocaust-inspired political neuroses take risks peace. Each time notion Arab diplomacy psychotherapy Israelis trotted out, met incredulity. To region, encapsulates contrast Washington's sympathy solicitude Israelis condescendingly exploitative view Arabs. Some see barely disguised appeal policy appeasement Israel. Still others suspect attempt construct "peace process" Arabs begin supply Israel gifts carrots Americans continue avoid applying sticks it. The effort encourage Arab generosity offset American political pusillanimity vis-a-vis Israel ludicrously unpersuasive. It failed many times obvious work. Yet central element George Mitchell's mandate "peace process" diplomacy. And appears resurfaced part proposed follow-up tomorrow's meeting parties Washington. It puzzle Saudis Arabs could persuaded join gathering. As last thought turning must done, let make quick comment relevant cultural factor. Arabic two quite different words translated "negotiation," making distinction doesn't exist either English Hebrew. One word, "musaawama," refers no-holds-barred bargaining process takes place bazaars strangers may never see therefore feel obligation scam other. Another, "mufaawadhat," describes dignified formal discussions matters honor high principle take place basis mutual respect equality statesmen seek continuing relationship. Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's travel Jerusalem grand act statesmanship initiate process mufaawadhat — relationship-building leaders polities. So Arab peace initiative 2002. It called response kind. The West muttered approvingly act. After while, Israel responded intermittent, somewhat oblique suggestions willingness haggle terms. But offer bicker terms grand gesture granted is, surprisingly, seen insultingly unresponsive. I cite suggest non-Arabs adopt Arabic canons thought, make point diplomatic effectiveness. To move negotiating partner desired direction, one must understand partner understands things help see way forward bring end persuaded want. One reasons can't seem move things desire Middle East don't make much effort understand others reason rank interests. In case Israel-Palestine conundrum, Americans long empathy expertise Israel very, short various Arab parties. The essential militarism U.S. policies Middle East adds difficulties. We become skilled killing Arabs. We forgotten listen persuade them. I "Arabist," I old enough remember people American diplomatic service. These officers devoted cultivation understanding empathy Arab leaders able convince leaders interest things saw interest. If still people, hiding well; certainly applying skills Middle East diplomacy. This brings thoughts Western Arab interests stake Holy Land implications must done. In foreign affairs, interests measure things. My assumption Americans Norwegians, indeed Europeans general, share common interests require peace Holy Land. To mind, interests include - are, course, limited — gaining security acceptance democratic state Israel; eliminating gross injustices daily humiliations foster Arab terrorism Israel foreign allies supporters, well friendly Arab regimes; reversing global spread religious strife prejudice, including, likely, revival anti-Semitism West current trends arrested. None aspirations fulfilled without end Israeli occupation freedom Palestinians. Arab states, like Saudi Arabia, also compelling reasons want relief occupation well self-determination Palestinians. They may concerned preserve Israel's democracy, are, share urgent interest ending radicalization populations, curbing spread Islamist terrorism, eliminating tensions West conflict Holy Land fuels. These concerns driven propose peace, clearly eight years ago. For related reasons, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah made inter-faith dialogue promotion religious tolerance main focus domestic international policy. As custodian two Islam's three sacred places pilgrimage — Mecca Medina — Saudi Arabia long transcended notorious religious narrow-mindedness hold holy places charge open Muslims sects persuasions. This experience, joined Islamic piety, reinforces Saudi insistence exemption religious pilgrimage Jerusalem political interference manipulation. The Ottoman Turks careful ensure freedom access worship adherents three Abrahamic faiths administered city. It interest Jews, Christians, Muslims share. There is, short, far greater congruity Western Arab interests affecting Israel-Palestine dispute generally recognized. This basis creative diplomacy. The fact occurred reflects pathologies political life United States paralyze American diplomatic imagination. Tomorrow's meeting may well demonstrate that, election Barack Obama notwithstanding, United States still unfit manage achievement peace Israel Arabs. If so, American interest well everyone else's others become path-breakers, enlisting United States best support achieve, expecting America overcome incapacity lead. Here, I think, lesson drawn Norwegian experience 1990s. The Clinton Administration happy organize public relations Oslo accords take ownership them. It little protect subversion overthrow, nothing insist implementation. Only peace process protected Israel's ability manipulate American politics succeed. This brings Europeans Arabs might work together realize objectives share Americans: establishing internationally recognized borders Israel, securing freedom Palestinians, ending stimulus terrorism region beyond strife Holy Land entails. I four suggestions present today. I expect ideas emerge discussion period. A serious effort cooperate Arabs sort Norway uniquely capable contriving could lead development still options joint parallel action behalf peace. Now suggestions, presented ascending order difficulty, least controversial. First, get behind Arab peace initiative. Saudi Arab culture frowns self-promotion Kingdom less gifted public diplomacy. Political factors inhibit official Arab access Israeli press. The Israeli media published — mostly dismissive — commentary Arab peace initiative left Israelis ignorant contents unfamiliar text. Why buy space Israeli media give Israelis chance read Arab League declaration consider opportunities presents? I suspect Saudis, well members Arab League, would consider constructive outside party this. It might facilitate sorts cooperation European capabilities also compensate Arab reticence. The Turks non-Arab Muslims brought full participants efforts. This wouldn't bad Europe's relations both. By way, given U.S. media's notorious one-sidedness American ignorance Arab peace plan, well-targeted advertising campaign United States might bad idea either. Second, help create Palestinian partner peace. There peace Israel unless officials empowered Palestinian people negotiate ratify it. Israel worked hard divide Palestinians consolidate conquest homeland. Saudi Arabia several times sought create Palestinian peace partner Israel bringing Fatah, Hamas, factions together. On occasion, Israel, U.S. support, acted preclude this. Active organization non-American Western support diplomacy aimed restoring unity government Palestinian Authority could make big difference. The Obama Administration would strong domestic political pressure join Israel blocking joint European-Arab effort accomplish this. Under circumstances, however, might welcome put test. Third, reaffirm enforce international law. The UN Security Council charged enforcing rule law internationally. In case Middle East, however, Council's position apex international system served erode subvert ideal rule-bound international order. Almost forty American vetoes prevented application Israeli occupying authorities Geneva Conventions, Nuremberg precedents, human rights conventions, relevant Security Council directives. American diplomacy behalf Jewish state silenced collective voice international community Israel illegally colonized annexed broad swaths occupied territory, administered collective punishment captive people, assassinated political leaders, massacred civilians, barred UN investigators, defied mandatory Security Council resolutions, otherwise engaged scofflaw behavior, usually flimsiest legally irrelevant excuses. If ethnic cleansing, settlement activity, like "unhelpful" illegal, international community find way say so, even UN Security Council cannot. Otherwise, valuable legacy Atlantic civilization - vision rule law — lost. When one side dispute routinely exempted principles, exempt themselves, law jungle prevails. The international community needs collectively affirm Israel, occupier regional military hegemon, legally accountable internationally actions. If UN General Assembly cannot "unite peace" incapacitated Security Council cannot, member states shrink working conference outside UN framework. All sides murder mayhem Holy Land beyond need understand law. If message firmly delivered enforced, better chance peace. Fourth, set deadline linked ultimatum. Accept United States frustrate attempt UN Security Council address continuing impasse Israel Palestinians. Organize global conference outside UN system coordinate decision inform parties dispute cannot reach agreement year, one two solutions imposed. Schedule follow-up conference year later. The second conference would consider whether recommend universal recognition Palestinian state area beyond Israel's 1967 borders recognition Israel's achievement de jure well de facto sovereignty throughout Palestine (requiring Israel grant governed citizenship equal rights pain international sanctions, boycott, disinvestment). Either formula would force parties make serious effort strike deal face consequences recalcitrance. Either formula could implemented directly states members international community. Admittedly, serious deadline would provoke political crisis Israel lead diplomatic confrontation United States well Israel, despite Obama Administration proclaimed one- year deadline order entice Palestinians tomorrow's talks. Yet Israel United States would benefit immensely peace Palestinians. Time running out. The two-state solution may already overtaken Israeli land grabs settlement activity. Another cycle violence likely offing. If so, local regional, global reach. Israel's actions delegitimizing isolating even multiply numbers region beyond determined destroy it. Palestinian suffering reproach humanity posturing alone cannot begin alleviate. It become cancer Islamic body politic. It infecting every extremity globe rage injustice incites terrorism. It time try new approaches. That question whether basis expanded diplomatic cooperation Europeans Arabs timely one. And I pleased well honored asked set stage discussion issue.
