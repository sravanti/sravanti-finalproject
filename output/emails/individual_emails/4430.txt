March 16, 2010 17:13 pm JERUSALEM—Suddenly, city feels like war zone..Since suicide bombings ended 2005, life Jerusalem part relatively calm. The worst disruptions traffic jams resulting construction light rail. jUst like normal city. But navy, again, clusters helmeted border nOtiCe near gates Old City. black smoke burning tires Arab village across porch, young men marching green Islamist flags toward neighborhood, ambulances parked strategic places ready city's ultimate nightmare. The return menace Jerusalem mid-level bureaucrat announced stage four seven-stage process eventual construction oft,600 apartments Ramat Shiomo. Jewish neighborhood northeast Jerusalem. Such announcements building projects become routine years Paestinians scarcely responded, let alone violently. In negotiations Palestinians Israelis, permanence Ramat Shiomo, Jewish neighborhoods East Jerusalem, given. Ramat Shlomo, located Jewish neighborhoods French Hill Rarrot, remain within boundaries Israeli Jerusalem accord ng every peace plan. Unlike Snail Jewish enclaves inserted Arab neighbochoocis, Israelis strongly buliding established Jewish neighborhoods East Jerusalem defines national consensus. Why, then, outbreak violence now? Why Harness "day rage" Jerusalem Palestinian Authority's call gather Temple Mount "save" Dome Rock non-existent plans build Third Temple? Why sudden outrage rebuilding synagogue, destroyed Jordanians 1948, Old City's Jewish Quarter, dozens synagogues yeshivas built quarter without incident? The answer lies Jerusalem Washington. By placing issue building Jewish neighborhoods East Jerusalem center peace process, President Obama inadvertently challenged Palestinians less. Astonishingly. Obama repeating key tactical mistake failed efforts restart Middle East peace talks last year. Though Oben-la's insistence settlement freeze help restart negotiations legitimate, went step far including building East Jerusalem. Every Israeli government last four decades built Jewish neighborhoods East Jerusalem; government, let alone one headed Likud, could possibly agree freeze there. Obama made resumption negotiations hostage demand could met. The result Palestinian leaders forced adjust demands accordingly. Obama directly responsible one absurd turns history Middle East negotiations. Though Palestinian leaders negotiated Israeli governments built extensively West Bank, refused sit first Israeli government actually agree suspension building. Obama's demand building freeze Jerusalem led freeze negotiations. Finally, intensive efforts, administration produced pathetic achievement "proximity talks"—setting Palestinian-Israeli negotiations back generation, time Palestinian leaders refused sit table Israelis. That Obama could guilty amateurishness perhaps forgivable was, ail, amateur. But taken failed policy intensified it. By demanding Israel stop building Ramat Shlomo elsewhere East Jerusalem—and placing demand center American-Israeli relations—he's ensured Palestinians won't show even proximity talks. This longer amateurishness; pique disguised policy. Initially, announcement building Ramat Shlomo made, Israelis shared Vice President Biden's humiliation outraged government's incompetence. The widespread sense Netanyahu deserved administration's condemnation, didn't do: He failed convey parts government need caution Biden's visit, symptomatic chaotic style governing generally. But even opposition accused Netanyahu deliberate provocation. These days Yitzhak Shamir, former Israeli prime minister used greet visit Secretary State James Baker announcement creation another West Bank settlement. Netanyahu placed need strategic cooperation U.S. Iranian threat ahead right-wing political agenda. That's included Labor Party coalition, accepted two-state solution—an historic achievement set Likud, however reluctantly, within mainstream consensus supporting Palestinian statehood. The last thing Netanyahu wanted embarrass Biden goodwill visit trigger clash Obama ultra-Orthodox neighborhood. Nor likely deliberate provocation ultra-Orthodox Shas party, runs interior ministry oversees building procedures. Shas, supports peace talks territorial compromise, nationalist party. Its interest providing housing constituents, like future residents Ramat Shlomo; provoking international incidents style. Finally, ordinariness building procedure—the fact construction Jewish East Jerusalem considered Israelis routine—is perhaps best proof intentional ambush Biden. Apparently one interior ministry could imagine long-term plan Ramat Shiomo would sabotage state visit. In turning incident crisis, Obama convinced many Israelis merely seeking, pretext pick fight Israel. Netanyahu inadvertently shabby; Obama, deliberately so. Ac.t,cording banner headline newspaper Ma'ariv, senior Likud officials believe Obama's goal topple Netanyahu government, encouraging Labor Party want quit coalition. The popular assumption Obama seeking prove resolve leader getting tough Israel. Given ineffectiveness Iran tendency violate self-imposed deadlines sanctions, Israeli public likely impressed. Indeed, Israelis' initial anger Netanyahu turned anger Obama. According Israel Radio poll March 16, 62 percent Israelis blame Obama administration crisis, 20 percent blame Netanyahu. (Another 17 percent blame Shas leader Eli Yishai.) • In last year, administration publicly condemned Palestinians lack good faith—even though Palestinian Authority media has, example, waging months-long campaign denying Jews' historic roots Jerusalem. Just Biden left Ramailah, Palestinian officials held ceremony naming square city terrorist responsible massacre 38 Israeli civilians. That didn't merit administration rebuke. Obama's one-sided public pressure Israel could intensify atmosphere "open season" Israel internationally. Indeed, European Union reaffirmed linking improved economic relations Israel resumption peace process—as it's Israel rather Palestinians refused come table. If administration's main tactical error Middle East negotiating emphasizing building Jerusalem, main strategic error assuming two-state solution within easy reach. Shortly Obama took office, Rehm Emanuel vvas quoted Israeli press insisting Palestinian state would created within Obama's first tent. instead, year later, era suspended proximity talks. Now administration demanding Israel negotiate final status issues proximity talks way convincing Palestinians agree talks--as Israelis would agree discuss future Jerusalem Palestinian leaders refuse even sit them. To insist imminent possibility two-state solution requires amnesia. Biden's plea Israelis consider withdrawal approximation 1967 borders exchange peace ignored fact Israel made offer twice last decade: first, Prime Minister Ehud Barak accepted Clinton Proposals December 2000, recently Prime Minister Ehud Olmert renewed offer Mahrnoud Abbas. Abbas, says Olmert, never replied. The reason Palestinian rejection two-state solution deal would require Palestinians confine return descendants 1948 refugees Palestine rather Israel. That would prevent two-state solution devolving bi-national, one-state solution. Israel's insistence survival remains obstacle peace. To achieve eventual peace, international community needs pressure Palestinian leaders forgo claim Haifa Jaffa confine people's right return future Palestinian state--just Jews need forgo claim Hebron Bethlehem confine people's right return state Israel. That possible deal: conceding right return Greater Israel exchange right return Greater Palestine. A majority Israelis—along political system—has accepted principle. On Palestinian side, political system rejected it. In absence Palestinian willingness compromise right return, negotiations focus two- state solution limited goals. There positive signs change Palestinian side last years. The rise Hamas created panic within Fatah, result is, first time, genuine security cooperation Israel. Also, emergence Salem Fayyad Palestinian prime minister marks shift ideological pragmatic leadership (though Fayyad still lacks power base). Finally, West Bank economy growing, thanks part Israel's removal dozens roadblocks. The goal negotiations point conflict encourage trends. But focusing building Jerusalem, Obama undermined possibility too. To fictitious notion peace process, Obama added fiction intransigent Israel blocking peace process. The administration, according report Israeli ne\Aispaper Yedito Aharonot, making even insidious accusation Israel. During visit, wrote Yediot Aharanot, Bicien told Israeli leaders policies endangering American lives Afghanistan Iraq. The report denied White House. Whether remark made, clear today Jerusalem Obama's recklessness endangering Israeli--and Palestinian-- lives. As I listen police sirens outside window, Obama's political Intifada Netanyahu seems turning third intifada Jerusalem.
