The Huffington Post October 12, 2010 oward Fineman finemanAhuffingtonpost.com I HuffPost Reporting The Power Of Clinton, The Invisibility Of Obama First Posted: 10-12-10 02:37 PM I Updated: 10-12-10 02:37 PM LOUISVILLE -- I see Dr. Rand Paul taken Bill Clinton, dredging Monica Lewinsky. And I know Paul so. The former president Kentucky yesterday state, many others, far potent popular foe President Barack Obama. On first day working The Huffington Post, I came back Kentucky, I began career many years ago Courier-Journal. The people run University Louisville Kentucky Author Forum wanted on-stage interview certain best-selling author also new boss: Arianna Huffington. It tricky mix professional incest personal nostalgia, event worked well I also got chance play Kentucky reporter state. I raced Lexington ground-level, outside-the-Beltway reality I witnessed: Like Voldemort's, Obama's name one dares utter -- includes Clinton speaking Democrats. At sunny, noontime rally campus University Kentucky Lexington yesterday, former president made stirring, well-argued case Democratic Senate candidate Jack Conway Democrats generally -- without mentioning Obama rarely mentioning presidency. It though suddenly two branches government. To fair, almost one else one-hour rally mentioned sitting president. And Kentucky staunch Republican territory. "We're farther ahead generic ballot ever," GOP Senator Mitch McConnell Kentucky told yesterday. "President Obama never popular here, even peak." Still, eerie invisibility president telling commentary Democrats' confused, divided defensive predicament brace verdict voters Election Day, Nov. 2. There something odd -- and, you're Democrat, depressing -- former Democratic president avoiding mention Democratic successor. Clinton sincerely wants help trail -- certainly wants avoid accusation didn't try help. But travels turned personal victory lap often makes -- candidate he's touting -- center attention. That true Kentucky. The rally's mechanics mostly handled Secret Service; point, final (and therefore top-billed) speaker wasn't Conway. It Clinton. The Conway people didn't mind. They glad him. Rail-thin frail, wearing tweedy professorial sports coat signature rueful, knowing smile, Clinton treated respect bordering awe. His familiar mane white hair, thinning now, translucent sun, giving almost otherworldly look: Sage Better Age. Clinton beloved In Kentucky. He won state twice. He speaks local dialect, contains Appalachian notes working-class pride, suspicion big shots Baptist revivalism. But -- Kentucky -- Clinton's economic record (22.7 million jobs created, tends forget mention .7) looks spectacularly good context followed. These days almost Old Testament, milk-and-honey reverence economic record, least expressed former Kentucky Sen. Wendell Ford. An old-school podium pounder, Ford -- stooped still strong voiced 86 -- talked former president messianic terms. "Bill Clinton found us path gold!" shouted. The crowd 2,000, students, didn't laugh. They seemed think right. How helps Obama far clear; isn't even clear helps many Democrats -- since they'd joining Washington party current president ostensibly heads. But Clinton happy show Obama it's done. As campaigner president, Clinton's gift ability untangle knots even complex policy issue explain plain language people suspicious powerful -- eager screwed seen dupes. Republicans corporate allies shut good things government you, said, name balancing budget destroyed. "I gave budget surpluses!" Clinton said, act personal beneficence. Knowing audience, former president focused Pell Grants, new program allows graduates pay back loans longer periods lower rates. Paul, said, try take new program away -- and, given GOP's deliberate vagueness spending cuts -- reason think Clinton right. Which Paul got personal today. Which means Clinton drew blood. Which means came do. Which means Obama remain invisible, least Kentucky, least now, probably long time come. Ci
