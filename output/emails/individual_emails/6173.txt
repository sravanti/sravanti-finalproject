For Sunday reading, summary interesting proposal former Jordanian foreign minister Marwan Muasher. "Palestinian-Israeli Direct Talks: The Case Regional Approach"By Marwan Muasher (Carnegie Endowment Bulletin, August 2010) Marwan Muasher – former Jordanian foreign minister, ambassador, deputy prime minister – advocates regional settlement Israeli-Palestinian conflict, capitalizing 2002 Arab Peace Initiative. His approach depends first securing end-game "deposits" parties: The parties would offer hypothetical commitments might willing give onset, "deposited" U.S. committed side willing same. Saudi Arabia's deposit, instance, would outline agree package included details Jerusalem. The Saudi package would also promise secure Arab Muslim backing painful compromises Palestinians would need accept. Muasher advocates similar approach Syrian track—asking Syria deposit end-game commitments return full Israeli withdrawal Golan Heights. In deposits, Saudis Syrians must clearly commit address inclusion Hamas Hezbollah regional agreement. The Arab states would end logistical, financial, military support two groups, would assume responsibility delivering two actors, helping transform political players. Israel's deposit would spell commitment solution based 1967 borders return Golan. According Muasher, deposits would make much easier President Abbas engage talks aimed ending conflict. After given Arab cover, Abbas could provide end-game deposits. According Muasher, absent commitments Arab states, Palestinian positions remain maximalist. Once U.S. deposits sides make reasonable, comprehensive package, put package table cooperation Quartet. Once comprehensive package presented, U.S. focus confidence- building measures move sides toward end game. AM
