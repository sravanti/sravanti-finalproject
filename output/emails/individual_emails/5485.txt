sbwhoeop Monday, May 10, 2010 4:52 PM H H: All still play, end Monday. Sid Gordon convinced sacrifice attempt form grand progressive coalition Lib-Dems. Clegg said campaign would deal Gordon remained adamant. Peter, Alastair, Ed Balls, Ed Miliband met secretly LD team Sunday. Gordon decided fall sword today. The negotiations Labour LDs engaged teams. The Tories time also negotiating. Both offer competing plans electoral reform would give LDs representation future. If LDs strike deal Tories Labour unlikely support campaign referendum. Cameron strained right now. His right approve deal others push make arrangement order attain power. Cameron may limited far go offer. But means Labour-LD deal certain even probable, even given Gordon's political suicide. The campaign leader replace Gordon begins soon Labour-LD negotiations concluded. David ready go; face Ed Balls possibly brother Ed. If coalition would tilt Balls, seen Gordon's heir inappropriate PM, Gordon redux, work LDs. One Milibands emerge. I still bet David. So four days election, everything still play. Sid
