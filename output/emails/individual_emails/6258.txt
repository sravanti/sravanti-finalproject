Sid B6 A must read piece looks Koch brothers control funding tea party right wing. http://www.nowyorkenconlirep2rtin08130/100830fa fpct maysl2pitatIbie=true#IxzzoxQ uvTcbT A REPORTER AT 1.ARGE COVERT OPERATIONS The billionaire brothers waging war Obama. Jane Mayetmo, (.s.. David H. Koch 1996. He brother Charles lifelong libertarians quietly given hundred million dollars right-wing causes. On May 17th, black-tie audience Metropolitan Opera House applauded tall, jovial-looking billionaire tOok stage. It seventieth annual spring gala American Ballet Theatre, David H. Koch celebrated generosity member board trustees; recently donated $2.5 million toward company's upcoming season, given many millions that. Koch received award flanked two gala's co-chairs, Blaine Trump, peach-colored gown, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, emerald green. Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, patron ballet and, coincidentally, previous owner Fifth Avenue apartment Koch bought, 1995, sold, eleven years later, thirty-two million dollars, found small. The gala marked social ascent Koch, who, age seventy, become one city's prominent philanthropists. In 2008, donated hundred million dollars modernize. Lincoln Center's New York State Theatre building, bears name. He given twenty million American Museum Natural History, whose dinosaur wing named him. This spring, noticing decrepit state fountains outside Metropolitan Museum Art, Koch pledged least ten million dollars renovation. He trustee museum, perhaps coveted social prize city, serves board Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where, donated forty million dollars, endowed chair research center named him. One dignitary conspicuously absent gala: event's third honorary co-chair, Michelle Obama. Her office said scheduling conflict prevented attending. Yet First Lady shared stage Koch might created awkward tableau. In Washington, Koch best known part family repeatedly funded stealth attacks federal government, Obama Administration particular. With brother Charles, seventy-four, David Koch owns virtually Koch Industries, conglomerate, headquartered Wichita. Kansas, whose annual revenues estimated hundred billion dollars. The company grown spectacularly since father, Fred, died, 1967, brothers took charge. The Kochs operate oil refineries Alaska, Texas, Minnesota, control four thousand miles pipeline. Koch Industries owns Brawny paper towels, Dixie. cups, Georgia-Pacific lumber, Staimnaster carpet, Lycra, among products. Forbes ranks second-largest private company country, Cargill, consistent profitability made David Charles Koch—who, years ago, bought two brothers—among richest Men America. Their combined fortune thirty-five billion dollars exceeded Bill Gates Warren Buffett. The Kochs longtime libertarians believe drastically lower personal corporate taxes, minimal social services needy, much less oversight industry—especially environmental regulation. These views dovetail brothers' corporate interests. In study released spring, University Massachusetts Amherst's Political Economy Research Institute named Koch Industries one top ten air polluters United States.- And Greenpeace issued report identifying company "kingpin climate science denial." The report showed that, 2005 2008, Kochs vastly outdid ExxonMobil giving money organizations fighting legislation related climate change, unclerwriting'a huge network foundations, think tanks, political front groups. Indeed, brothers funded opposition campaigns many Obama Administration policies—from health-care reform economic-stimulus program----that, political circles, ideological network known Kochtopus. In statement, Koch Industries said Greenpeace report "distorts environmental record companies." And. . David Koch, recent, admiring article New York, protested "radical press" turned family "whipping boys," exaggerated influence American politics. But Charles Lewis, founder Center Public Integrity, nonpartisan watchdog group, said, "The Kochs whole different level. There's one else spent much money. The sheer dimension sets apart. They pattern lawbreaking, political manipulation, obfuscation. I've Washington since Watergate, I've never seen anything like it. They Standard Oil times." weeks Lincoln Center gala, advocacy wing Americans Prosperity Foundation—an organization David Koch started, 2004—held different kind gathering. Over July 4th weekend, summit called Texas Defending American Dream took place chilly hotel ballroom Austin. Though Koch freely promotes philanthropic ventures, lie attend summit, name evidence. And occasion audience roused a,dance performance series speakers denouncing President Barack Obama. Peggy Venable, organizer summit, warned Administration officials "have socialist visiOn country." Five hundred people attended summit, served, part, training session Tea Party activists Texas. An advertisement cast event populist uprising vested corporate power. "Today, voices average Americans drowned lobbyists special interests," said. "But something it." The pitch made mention corporate funders. The White House expressed frustration sponsors largely eluded public notice. David . Axelrod, Obama's senior adviser, said, "What don't say that, part, grassroots citizens' movement brought bunch oil billionaires." In April, 2009, Melissa Cohlmia, company spokesperson; denied Kochs direct links Tea Party, saying Americans Prosperity "an independent organization Koch companies way direct activities." .Later, issued statement: "No funding provided Koch companies, Koch foundations, Charles Koch David Koch specifically support tea parties." David Koch told New York, "I've never tea-party event. No one representing tea party ever even approached me." At lectern Austin, however, Venable—a longtime political operative draws salary Americans Prosperity, worked Koch-funded political groups since 1994—spoke less warily: "We love Tea Parties doing, that's we're going take back America!" declared, crowd cheered. In subsequent interview, described early member movement, joking, "I part Tea Party cool!" She explained role Americans Prosperity help "educate" Tea Party activists policy details, give "next-step training" rallies, political energy could channelled "more effectively." And noted Americans Prosperity provided Tea Party activists lists elected officials target. She said Kochs. "They're certainly people. David's chairman board. I've certainly met them, I'm appreciative Of do." Venable honored several Tea Party "citizen leaders" summit. The Texas branch Americans Prosperity gave Blogger Year Award young woman named Sibyl West. On June 14th, West, writing site, described Obama "cokehead chief." In online thread, West speculated President exhibiting symptoms "demonic possession (aka schizophrenia, etc.)." The summit featured several paid speakers, including Janine Turner, actress best known role television series "Northern Exposure." She declared, "They don't want children know rights. They don't want children know God!" During catered lunch, Venable introduced Ted Cruz, former solicitor general Texas, told crowd Obama "the radical President ever occupy Oval Office," hidden voters secret agenda—"the government taking economy lives." Countering Obama, Cruz proclaimed, epic fight generation!" As crowd rose feet cheered, quoted defiant words Texan Alamo: "Victory, death!" Americans Prosperity worked closely Tea Party since movement's inception. In weeks first Tax Day protests, April, 2009, Americans Prosperity hosted Web site offering supporters "Tea Party Talking Points." The Arizona branch urged people send tea bags Obama; Missouri branch urged members sign "Taxpayer Tea Party Registration" provided directions nine protests. The group continues stoke rebellion. The North Carolina branch recently launched "Tea Party Finder" Web site, advertised "a hub Tea Parties North Carolina." The anti-government fervor infusing 2010 elections represents political triumph Kochs. By giving money "educate," fund, organize Tea Party protesters, helped turn private agenda mass movement. Bruce Bartlett, conservative economist historian, worked National Center Policy Analysis, Dallas-based think tank Kochs fund, said, "The problem whole libertarian movement it's chiefs Indians. There haven't actual people, like voters, give crap it. So problem Kochs trying create movement." With emergence Tea Party, said, "everyone suddenly sees first time Indians there—people provide real ideological power." The Kochs, said, "trying shape control channel populist uprising policies."- A Republican campaign consultant done research behalf Charles David Koch said Tea Party, "The Koch brothers gave money founded it. It's like put seeds ground. Then rainstorm comes, frogs come mud—and they're candidates!" The Kochs political operatives declined requests interviews. Instead, prominent New York public-relations executive close Kochs put forward two friends: George Pataki, former governor New York, Mortimer Zuckerman, publisher real-estate magnate. Pataki, Republican received campaign donations David Koch, called "a patriot cares deeply country." Zuckerman praised David's "gentle decency" "range public interests." The Republican campaign consultant said family's political activities, "To call radar understatement. They underground!" Another former Koch adviser said, "They're smart. This right-wing, redneck stuff works them. They see way get things done without getting dirty themselves." Rob Stein, Democratic political strategist studied conservative movement's finances, said Kochs "at epicenter anti-Obama movement. But it's Obama. They would done Hillary Clinton. They Bill • Clinton. They destroy progressivism." ddly enough, fiercely capitalist Koch family owes part fortune Joseph Stalin. Fred Koch son Dutch printer settled Texas ran weekly newspaper. Fred attended M.I.T., earned degree chemical engineering. In 1927, invented efficient process converting oil gasoline; but, according family lore, America's major oil companies regarded threat shut industry. Unable succeed home, Koch found work Soviet Union. In nineteen-thirties, company trained Bolshevik engineers helped Stalin's regime set fifteen modern oil refineries. Over time, however, Stalin brutally purged several Koch's Soviet colleagues. Koch deeply affected experience, regretted collaboration. He returned U.S. In headquarters company, Rock Island Oil & Refining, Wichita, kept photographs aimed proving Soviet refineries destroyed Second World War. Gus diZerega, former friend Charles Koch, recalled, "As Soviets became stronger military power, Fred felt certain amount guilt helped build up. I think bothered lot." In 1958, Fred Koch became one original members john Birch Society, arch-conservative group known, part, highly skeptical view governance spreading fears Communist takeover. Members considered President Dwight D. Eisenhower Communist agent. In self-published broadside, Koch claimed Communists infiltrated Democrat Republican Parties." He wrote admiringly Benito Mussolini's suppression Communists Italy, disparagingly American civil-rights movement. "The colored man looms large Communist plan take America," warned. Welfare secret plot attract rural blacks cities, would foment "a vicious race war." In 1963 speech prefigures Tea Party's talk secret 'socialist plot, Koch predicted Communists would "infiltrate highest offices government U.S. President Communist, unknown rest us." Koch married Mary Robinson, daughter Missouri physician, four sons: Freddie, Charles, twins, David William. John Damgard, president Futures Industry Association, David's schoolmate friend. He recalled Fred Koch "a real John Wayne type." Koch emphasized rugged pursuits, taking sons big-game hunting Africa, requiring farm labor family ranch. The Kochs lived stone mansion large compound across Wichita's country club; summer, boys could hear friends splashing pool, allowed join them. "By instilling work ethie early age, father big favor, although didn't seem like favor back then," Charles written. "By time I eight, made sure work occupied spare time." David Koch recalled father also indoctrinated boys politically. "He constantly speaking us children wrong government," told Brian Doherty, editor libertarian magazine Reason, author "Radicals Capitalism," 2007 history libertarian movement. "It's something I grew with—a fundamental point view big government bad, imposition government controls lives economic fortunes good." David attended Deerfield Academy, Massachusetts, Charles sent military school. Charles, David, William earned engineering degrees father's alma mater, M.I.T., later joined family company. Charles eventually assumed control, David deputy; William's career company less successful. Freddie went Harvard studied playwriting Yale School Drama. His father reportedly disapproved him, punished financially. (Freddie, spokesperson, denied this:) In 1967, Fred Koch died, heart attack, Charles renamed business Koch Industries, honor father. Fred Koch's made sons extraordinarily wealthy. David Koch joked good fortune 2003 speech alumni Deerfield, where, pledging twenty-five million dollars, made school's sole "lifetime trustee." He said, "You might ask: How David Koch happen wealth generous? Well, let tell story. It started I alittle boy. One day, father gave apple. I soon sold five dollars bought two apples sold ten. Then I bought four apples sold twenty. Well, went day day, week week, month month, year year, father died left three hundred million dollars!" David Charles absorbed father's conservative politics, share views, according diZerega, befriended Charles mid-sixties, meeting browsing John Birch Society bookstore Wichita. Charles eventually invited Kochs' mansion, participate informal political-discussion group. "It pretty clear Charles thought Birch Society bullshit," diZerega recalled. DiZerega, lost touch Charles, eventually abandOned right-wing views, became political-science professor. He credits Charles opening mind political philosophy, set path academia; Charles one three people dedicated first book. But diZerega believes Koch brothers followed wayward intellectual trajectory, transferring father's paranoia Soviet Communism distrust U.S. government, seeing expansion, beginning New Deal, tyrannical threat freedom. In essay, posted Beliefnet, diZerega writes, "As state socialism failed ... target many within organizations shifted kind regulation all. 'Socialism' kept. defined downwards." Members the. John Birch Society developed.an interest school Austrian economists promoted free-market ideals. Charles David Koch particularly influenced work Friedrich von Hayek, author "The Road Serfdom" (1944), argued centralized government planning led, inexorably, totalitarianism. Hayek'S belief unfettered capitalism proved inspirational many conservatives, anti-Soviet dissidents; lately, Tea Party supporters championed work. In June, talk-radio host Glenn Beck, supported Tea Party rebellion, promoted "The Road Serfdom" show; paperback soon became No. 1 best-seller Amazon. (Beck appears fan Kochs; midst arecent on-air parody Al Gore, Beck said, without explanation, "I want thank Charles Koch information." Beck declined elaborate relationship.) Charles David also became devotees radical thinker, Robert LeFevre, favored abolition state didn't like label "anarchist"; called "autarchist." LeFevre liked say "government disease masquerading cure." In 1956, opened institution called Freedom School, Colorado Springs. Brian Doherty, Reason, told "LeFevre anarchist figure won Charles's heart," school "a tiny world people thought New Deal horrible mistake." According diZerega, Charles supported school financially, even gave money take classes there. Throughout seventies, Charles David continued build Koch Industries. In 1980, William, assistance Freddie, attempted take company Charles, who, felt, assumed autocratic control. In retaliation, company's board, answered Charles, fired William. ("Charles runs iron hand," Bruce Bartlett, economist, told me.) Lawsuits filed, William Freddie one side Charles David other. In 1983, Charles David bought brothers' share company nearly billion dollars. But antagonism remained, litigation continued seventeen years, brothers hiring rival private investigators; 1990, walked past one another stony expressions mother's funeral. Eventually. Freddie moved Monaco, income tax. He bought historic, estates France. Austria, elsewhere, filling art, antiques, opera scores, literary manuscripts. William founded energy company, Oxbow, turned yachting; spent estimated sixty-five million dollars win America's Cup, 1992. With Charles undisputed chairman C.E.O., Koch Industries expanded rapidly. Roger Altman, heads investment-banking firm Evercore, told company's performance "beyond phenomenal." Charles remained Wichita, wife two children, guarding privacy supporting community charities. David moved New York City, executive vice-president company C.E.O. Chemical Technology Group. A financial expert knows Koch Industries well told me, "Charles company. Charles runs it." David, described associates "affable" "a bit lunk," enjoyed years life wealthy bachelor. He rented yacht South France bought waterfront home Southampton, threw parties Web site New York Social Diary likened "East Coast version Hugh Hefher's soirees." In 1996, married Julia Flesher, fashion assistant. They live nine- thousand-square-foot duplex 740 Park Avenue, three children. Though David's manner cosmopolitan, genial, Charles, Brian Doherty, interviewed brothers, couldn't think single issue brothers disagreed. As fortunes grew, Charles David Koch became primary underwriters hard-line libertarian politics America. Charles's goal, Doherty described it, tear government "out root." The brothers' first major public step came 1979, Charles persuaded David, thirty-nine, run public office. They become supporters Libertarian Party, backing Presidential candidate, Ed Clark, running Ronald Reagan right. Frustrated legal limits campaign donations, contrived place David ticket, Vice-Presidential slot; upon becoming candidate, could lavish much personal fortune wished campaign. The ticket's slogan "The Libertarian Party one source funds: You." In fact, primary source funds David Koch, spent two million dollars effort. Many ideas propounded 1980 campaign presaged Tea Party movement. Ed Clark told The Nation libertarians getting ready stage "a big tea party," people "sick death" taxes. The Libertarian Party platform called abolition F.B.I. C.I.A., well federal regulatory agencies, Securities Exchange Commission Department Energy. The Party wanted end Social Security, minimum-wage laws, gun control, personal corporate income taxes; proposed legalization prostitution, recreational drugs, suicide. Government reduced one function: protection individual rights. William F. Buckley, Jr., traditional conservative, called movement "Anarcho-Totalitarianism." That November, Libertarian ticket received one per cent vote. The brothers realized brand politics didn't sell ballot box. Charles Koch became openly scornful conventional politics. "It tends nasty, corrupting business," told reporter time. "I'm interested advancing libertarian ideas." According Doherty's book, .Kochs came regard elected politicians merely "actors playing script." A longtime confidant Kochs told Doherty brothers wanted "supply themes words scripts." In order alter direction America, "influence areas policy ideas percolate from: academia. think tanks." fter 1980 election, Charles David Koch receded public arena. But poured hundred million . dollars dozens seemingly independent organizations. Tax records indicate 2008 three main Koch family foundations gave money.to thirty-four political policy organizations, three founded, several direct. The Kochs company given additional millions political campaigns, advocacy groups, lobbyists. The family's subterranean financial role fuelled suspicion left: Lee Fang, liberal blog ThinkProgress, called Kochs billionaires behind hate." Only Kochs know precisely much spent politics. Public tax records show 1998 2008 Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation spent forty-eight million dollars. The Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, controlled Charles Koch wife, along two company employees accountant, spent twenty-eight million. The David H. Koch Charitable Foundation spent hundred twenty million. Meanwhile, since 1998 Koch Industries spent fifty million dollars lobbying. Separately, company's political-action committee, KochPAC, donated eight million dollars political campaigns, eighty per cent Republicans. So far 2010, Koch Industries leads energy companies political contributions, since 2006. In addition, past dozen years Kochs family members personally spent two million dollars political contributions. In second quarter 2010, David Koch biggest individual contributor Republican Governors Association, million-dollar donation. Other gifts Kochs may untraceable; federal tax law permits anonymous personal donations politically active nonprofit groups. In recent decades, members several industrial dynasties spent parts fortunes conservative agenda. In nineteen-eighties, Olin family, owns chemicals-and-manufacturing conglomerate, became known funding right-leaning thinking academia, particularly law schools. And nineties Richard Mellon Scaife, descendant Andrew Mellon, spent millions attempting discredit President Bill Clinton. An Rabin-Havt, vice-president Democratic-leaning Web site Media Matters, said Kochs' effort Unusual, marshalling corporate personal funds: "Their role, terms financial commitments, staggering." Of course, Democrats give money, too. Their prominent donor, financier George Soros, runs foundation, Open Society Institute, spent much hundred million dollars year America. Soros also made generous private contributions various Democratic campaigns, including Obama's. But Michael Vachon, spokesman, argued Soros's giving transparent, "none contributions service economic interests." The Kochs given millions dollars nonprofit groups criticize environmental regulation support lower taxes industry. Gus diZerega, former friend, suggested Kochs' youthful idealism libertarianism largely devolved rationale corporate self-interest. He said Charles, "Perhaps confused making money freedom." Some critics suggested Kochs' approach subverted purpose tax-exempt giving. By law, charitable foundations must conduct exclusively nonpartisan activities promote public welfare. A 2004 report National Committee Responsive Philanthropy, watchdog group, described Kochs' foundations self-serving, concluding, "These foundations give money nonprofit organizations research advocacy issues impact profit margin Koch Industries." The Kochs gone well beyond immediate self-interest, however, funding organizations aim push country libertarian. direction. Among institutions subsidized Institute Justice, files. lawsuits opposing state federal regulations; Institute Humane Studies, underwrites libertarian academics; Bill Rights Institute, promotes conservative slant Constitution. Many organizations funded Kochs employ specialists write position Papers subsequently quoted politicians pundits. David Koch acknowledged family exerts tight ideological control. "If we're going give lot money, we'll make darn sure • spend way goes along intent," told Doherty. "And make wrong turn start things don't agree with, withdraw funding." Kochs' subsidization pro-corporate movement fulfills, many ways, vision laid secret 1971 memo Lewis Powell. Virginia attorney, wrote two months nominated Supreme Court. The antiwar movement turned anger defense contractors, Dow Chemical, Ralph Nader leading public-interest crusade corporations. Powell, writing report U.S. Chamber Commerce, urged American companies fight back. The greatest threat free enterprise, warned, Communism New Left but, rather, "respectable elements society"—intellectuals, journalists, scientists. To defeat them, wrote, business leaders needed wage long-term, • unified campaign change public opinion. Charles Koch seems approached business politics deliberation engineer. "To bring social change," told Doherty, requires "a strategy" "vertically horizontally integrated," spanning "from idea creation policy development education grassroots organizations lobbying litigation political action." The project, admitted, extremely ambitious. "We radical philosophy," said. In 1977, Kochs provided funds launch nation's first libertarian think tank, Cato Institute. According 'Center Public Integrity, 1986 1993 Koch family gave eleven million dollars institute. Today Cato hundred full-time employees, experts policy papers widely quoted respected mainstream media. It describes nonpartisan, scholars times critical parties. But consistently pushed corporate tax cuts, reductions social services, laissez-faire environmental policies. When President Obama, 2008 speech, described science global warming "beyond dispute," Cato Institute took full-page ad Times contradict him. Cato's resident scholars relentlessly criticized political attempts stop global warming expensive, ineffective, unnecessary. Ed Crane, Cato Institute's founder president, told "global-warming theories give government control economy." Cato scholars particularly energetic promoting Climategate scandal. Last year, private e-mails climate scientists University East Anglia, England, mysteriously leaked, exchanges appeared suggest willingness falsify data order buttress idea global warming real. In two weeks e-mails went public, one Cato scholar gave twenty media interviews trumpeting alleged scandal. But five independent inquiries since exonerated researchers, nothing found e-mails data discredit scientific consensus global warming. • Nevertheless, controversy succeeded spreading skepticism climate change. Even though National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration recently issued report concluding evidence global warming unequivocal, Americans convinced time since 1997 scientists exaggerated seriousness global warming. The Kochs promote statistic company's Web site mention role funding played fostering doubt. In 2002 memo, Republican political consultant Frank Luntz wrote long "voters believe consensus global warming within scientific community' status quo would prevail. The key opponents environmental reform, said, question science—a public-relations strategy tobacco industry used effectively years forestall regulation. The Kochs funded many sources environmental skepticism, Heritage Foundation, argued "scientific facts gathered past 10 years support notion catastrophic human-made warming." The brothers given money obscure groups, too, Independent Women's Forum, opposes presentation global warming scientific fact American public schools. Until 2008, group run Nancy Pfotenhauer, former lobbyist Koch Industries. Mary Beth Jarvis, vice-president Koch subsidiary, group's board. Naomi Oreskes, professor history science studies University California, San Diego, co-author "Merchants Doubt," new book chronicles various attempts American industry manipulate public opinion science. She noted Kochs, heads "a company refineries pipelines," "a lot stake." She added, "If answer phase fossil fuels, different group people going making money, shouldn't surprised they're fighting tooth nail." David Koch told New York unconvinced global warming caused human activity. Even been, said, heating planet beneficial, resulting longer growing seasons Northern Hemisphere. "The Earth able support enormously people far greater land area available produce food," said. n mid-eighties, Kochs provided millions dollars George Mason University, Arlington, Virginia, set another think tank. Now known Mercatus Center, promotes "the world's premier university source market-oriented ideas—bridging gap academic ideas real-world problems." Financial records show Koch family foundations contributed thirty million dollar's George Mason, much gone Mercatus Center, nonprofit organization. "It's ground zero deregulation policy Washington," Rob Stein, Democratic strategist, said. It unusual arrangement. "George Mason public university, receives public funds," Stein noted. "Virginia hosting institution Kochs practically control." The founder Mercatus Center Richard Fink, formerly economist. Fink heads Koch Industries' lobbying operation Washington. In addition, president Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, president Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, director Fred C. Mary R. Koch Foundation, director co- founder, David Koch, Americans Prosperity Foundation. Fink, many titles, become central nervous system Kochtopus. He appears supplanted Ed Crane, head Cato Institute, brothers' main political lieutenant. Though David remains board Cato, Charles Koch fallen Crane. Associates suggested Crane insufficiently respectful Charles's management philosophy, distilled book called "The Science Success," trademarked name Market-Based Management, M.B.M. In book. Charles recommends instilling company's corporate culture competitiveness marketplace.. Koch describes M.B.M. "holistic system" containing "five dimensions: vision, virtue talents, knowledge processes, decision rights incentives." A top Cato Institute official told Charles "thinks he's genius. He's emperor, he's convinced he's wearing clothes." Fink, contrast, far embracing Charles's ideas. (Fink, like Kochs, declined to. interviewed.) At 1995 conference philanthropfsts, Fink adopted language economics speaking Mercatus Center's purpose. He said grant-makers use think tanks political-action groups convert intellectual raw materials policy "products." The Wall Street Journal called Mercatus Center "the important think tank you've never heard of," noted fourteen twenty-three regulations President George W. Bush placed "hit list" suggested first Mercatus scholars. Fink told paper Kochs "other means fighting [their] battles," Mercatus Center riot actively promote company's private interests. But Thomas McGarity, law professor University Texas, specializes environmental issues, told "Koch constantly trouble E.P.A., Mercatus constantly hammered agency." An environmental lawyer clashed Mercatus Center called "a means laundering economic aims." The lawyer explained strategy: "You take corporate money give neutral-sounding think tank," "hires people pedigrees academic degrees put credible-seeming studies. But coincide perfectly economic interests funders." In 1997, instance, E.P.A. moved reduce surface ozone, form pollution caused, part, emissions oil refineries. Susan Dudley, economist became top official 'Mercatus Center, criticized proposed rule. The E.P.A., argued, taken account smog-free skies would result cases skin cancer. She projected pollution controlled would cause eleven thousand additional cases skin cancer year. In 1999, District Columbia Circuit Court took 'up Dudley's smog argument. Evaluating E.P.A. rule, court found E.P.A. "explicitly disregarded" "possible health benefits ozone." In another part opinion, court ruled, 2-1, E.P.A. overstepped authority calibrating standards ozone emissions. As Constitutional Accountability Center, think tank, revealed, judges majority previously attended legal junkets, Montana ranch, arranged Foundation Research Economics Environment—a group funded Koch family foundations. The judges claimed ruling unaffected attendance. deas don't happen own," Matt Kibbe, president Freedom Works, Tea Party advocacy group, told me. "Throughout history, ideas need patrons." The Koch brothers, helping create Cato Mercatus, concluded think tanks alone enough effect change. They needed mechanism deliver ideas street, attract public's support. 1984, David Koch Richard Fink created yet another organization. Kibbe joined them. The group, Citizens Sound Economy, seemed like grassroots movement, according Center Public Integrity sponsored principally Kochs, provided $7.9 million 1986 19.93. Its mission, Kibbe said, "was take heavy ideas translate mass America.... We read literature Obama nonviolent revolutions--Saul _Minsky, Gandhi, Martin Luther King. We studied idea Boston Tea Party example nonviolent social change. We learned needed boots ground sell ideas, candidates." Within years, group mobilized fifty paid field workers, twenty-six states, rally voters behind Kochs' agenda. David Charles, according one participant, "very controlling, top down. You can't build organization them. They run it." Around time, brothers faced political crisis. In 1989, Senate Select Committee Indian Affairs investigated business released scathing report accusing Koch Oil "a widespread sophisticated scheme steal crude oil Indians others fraudulent mismeasuring." The Kochs admitted improperly taken thirty-one million dollars' worth crude oil, said accidental. Charles Koch told committee investigators oil measurement "a uncertain art." To defend reputation, Koch IndustrieS hired Robert Strauss, premier Washington lobbyist; company soon opened office city. A grand jury convened investigate allegations, eventually disbanded, without issuing criminal charges. According Senate report, committee hearings Koch operatives delved personal lives committee staffers, even questioning ex-wife. Senate investigators upset Kochs' tactics. Kenneth Batten, counsel Senate committee, said, "These people amassed unaccountable power!' .' By •1993, Bill Clinton became President, Citizens Sound Economy become prototype kind corporate-backed opposition campaigns proliferated Obama era. The group waged successful assault Clinton's proposed B.T.U. tax energy, instance, running advertisements, staging media events, targeting opponents. And mobilized anti-tax rallies outside Capitol—rallies NPR described "designed strike fear hearts wavering Democrats." Dan Glickman, former Democratic congressman Wichita, supported B.I.U. tax, recalled, "I'd Congress eighteen years. The Kochs actually engaged funded opponent. They used lot 'resources effort—their employees, too." Glickman suffered surprise defeat. "I can't prove it, I think I probably victim," said. The Kochs continued disperse money, creating slippery organizations generic-sounding names, made difficult ascertain extent influence Washington. In 1990, Citizens Sound Economy created spinoff group, Citizens Environment, called acid rain environmental problems "myths." When Pittsburgh Post-Gazette investigated matter, discovered spinoff group "no citizen membership own." In 1997, another Senate investigation began looking minority report called "an audacious plan pour millions dollars contributions Republican campaigns nationwide without disclosing amount source," order evade campaign-finance laws. A shell corporation, Triad Management, paid three million dollars attack ads twenty-six House races three Senate races. More half advertising money came obscure nonprofit group, Economic Education Trust. The Senate committee's minority report suggested "the trust financed whole part Charles David Koch Wichita, Kansas." The brothers suspected secretly paid attack ads, aired states Koch Industries business. In Kansas, Triad Management especially active, funds may played decisive role four six federal races. The Kochs, asked reporters given money, refused comment. In i998, however, Wall Street Journal confirmed consultant Kochs' payroll involved scheme. Charles Lewis, Center Public Integrity, described scandal "historic. Triad first time major corporation used cutout"—a front operation—"in threatening way. Koch Industries poster child company run amok." uring Clinton Administration, energy industry faced increased scrutiny regulation. In mid-nineties, Justice Department filed two lawsuits Koch Industries, claiming responsible three hundred oil spills, released estimated three million gallons oil lakes rivers. The penalty potentially high two hundred fourteen million dollars. In settlement. Koch Industries paid record thirty-million-dollar civil fine, agreed spend five million dollars environmental projects. In 1999, jury found Koch Industries guilty negligence malice deaths two Texas teen-agers explosion resulted leaky underground butane pipeline. (In 2001, company paid undisclosed settlement.) And final months Clinton Presidency Justice Department levelled ninety-seven-count indictment company, covering discharge ninety-one tons benzene, carcinogen, refinery Corpus Christi, Texas. The company liable •for three hundred fifty million dollars fines, four Koch employees faced thirty-five years prison. The Koch Petroleum Group eventually pleaded guilty one criminal charge covering environmental violations, including falsification documents, paid twenty-million-dollar fine. David Uhlmann, career prosecutor who, time, headed environmental-crimes section Justice Department, described suit "one significant cases ever brought Clean Air Act." He added, "Environmental crimes almost always motivated economics arrogance, Koch case healthy dose both." During 2000 election campaign, Koch Industries spent nine hundred thousand dollars support candidacies George W. Bush Republicans. During Bush years, Koch Industries fossil-fuel companies enjoyed remarkable prosperity. The 2005 energy bill, Hillary Clinton dubbed Dick Cheney Lobbyist Energy Bill, offered enormous subsidies tax breaks energy companies. The Kochs cast deficit hawks, but, according study Media Matters, companies benefitted nearly hundred million dollars government contracts since 2000. In 2004, Citizens Sound Economy accused illegitimately throwing weight behind Bush's reelection. The group's Oregon branch attempted get Ralph Nader Presidential ballot, order dilute Democratic support John Kerry. Critics argued illegal, tax-exempt nonprofit organization donate services partisan political purposes. (A complaint filed Federal Election Commission; dismissed.) That year, internal rivalries Citizens Sound Economy caused organization split apart. David Koch Fink started new group, Americans Prosperity, hired Tim Phillips run it. Phillips political veteran worked Ralph Reed, evangelical leader Republican activist, co-founding Century Strategies, campaign- consulting company became notorious ties disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Phillips's online biography describes expert "grasstops" "grassroots" political organizing. The Kochs' choice Phillips signalled even greater toughness. The conservative operative Grover Norquist, known praising "throat slitters" politics, called Phillips "a grownup make things happen." Last year, Phillips told Financial Times Americans Prosperity eight thousand registered members. Currently, Web site claims group "1.2 million activists." Whatever size, Kochs' political involvement intense; former employee Cato Institute told Americans Prosperity "was micromanaged Kochs." And brothers' investment may well paid off: Americans Prosperity, concert family's organizations, instrumental disrupting Obama Presidency. In January, 2008, Charles Koch wrote company newsletter America could verge "the greatest loss liberty prosperity since 1930s." That October, Americans Prosperity held conference conservative operatives Marriott hotel outside Washington. Erick Erickson, editor-in-chief conservative blog RedState.com, took lectern, thanked David Koch, vowed "unite fiaht ... armies left!" Sodn Obama assumed office, Americans Prosperity launched "Porkulus" rallies Obama's stimulus-spending measures. Then Mercatus Center released report claiming stimulus funds directed disproportionately toward Democratic districts; eventually, author forced correct report, Rush Limbaugh, citing.the paper, labelled Obama's program "a slush fund," Fox News conservative outlets echoed sentiment. (Phil Kerpen, vice-president policy Americans Prosperity, contributor Fox News Web site. Another officer Americans Prosperity, Walter Williams, often guest-hosts Limbaugh.) Americans Prosperity also created offshoot, Patients United Now, organized Phillips estimated three hundred rallies health-care reform. Atone rally, effigy Democratic congressman hung; another, protesters unfurled banner depicting corpses Dachau. The group also helped organize "Kill Bill" protests outside Capitol, March, Democratic supporters health-care reform alleged spat cursed at. Phillips featured speaker. Americans Prosperity held least eighty events targeting cap-and-trade legislation, aimed making industries pay air pollution create. Speakers group claimed, exaggeration, even back-yard barbecues kitchen stoves would taxed. The group also involved attacks Obama's "green jobs" czar, Van Jones, waged crusade international climate talks. Casting, group champion ordinary workers would hurt environmentalists, Phillips went Copenhagen last year staged protest outside United Nations conference climate change, declaring, "We're grassroots organization.... 1 think it's unfortunate wealthy children wealthy families . want send unemployment rates United States twenty per cent." Grover Norquist, holds weekly meeting conservative leaders Washington, including representatives Americans Prosperity, told last summer's raucous rallies pivotal undermining Obama's agenda. The Republican leadership Congress, said, "couldn't clone without August, people went streets. It discouraged deal-makers"—Republicans might otherwise worked constructively Obama. Moreover, appearance growing public opposition Obama affected corporate donors K Street. "K Street three-billion-dollar weathervane," Norquist said. "When Obama strong, Chamber Commerce said, 'We work Obama Administration.' But changed thousands people went street 'terrorized' congressmen. August changed it. Now Obama weak, people getting tough." As first anniversary Obama's election approached, David Koch came Washington area attend triumphant Americans Prosperity gathering. Obama's poll numbers falling fast. Not .a single Republican senator working Administration health care, much else. Pundits writing Obama's political ineptitude, Tea Party groups accusing President initiating "a government takeover." In speech, Koch said, "Days like today bring reality vision board directors started organization, five years ago." He went on, "We envisioned mass movement, state-based one, national scope, hundreds thousands American citizens walks life standing fighting economic freedoms made nation prosperous society history.... Thankfully, stirrings California Virginia, Texas Michigan, show fellow-citizens beginning see truths do." . While Koch didn't explicitly embrace Tea Party movement day, recently come close so, praising demonstrating "powerful visceral hostility body politic massive increase government power, massive efforts socialize country." Charles Koch, newsletter sent seventy thousand employees, compared Obama Administration regime Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. The Kochs' sense imperilment somewhat puzzling. Income inequality America greater since nineteen-twenties, since seventies tax rates wealthiest fallen middle class. Yet brothers' message evidently resonated voters: recent poll found fifty-five per cent Americans agreed Obama socialist. Americans Prosperity, meanwhile, announced spend additional forty-five million dollars midterm elections, November. Although group legally prohibited directly endorsing candidates, nonetheless plans target fifty House races half dozen Senate races, staging rallies, organizing door-to-door canvassing, running ads aimed "educating voters candidates stand." Though Kochs slowed Obama's momentum, larger political battle far won. Richard Fink, interviewed FrumForum.com spring, said, "If look we've gone year 2000 now, expansion government spending debt burden threatens bankrupt country, doesn't look good all." He went on, "It looks like infrastructure built ruirtitred carried day." He suggested Kochs needed "to get practical, day-to-day issues governing." n 1991, David Koch badly injured plane crash.in Los Angeles. He sole passenger first class survive. As recovering, routine physical exam led discovery prostate cancer. Koch received treatment, settled down, started family, reconsidered life. As told Portfolio, "When you're one survived front plane everyone.else died—yeah, think, 'My God, good Lord spared greater purpose.' My joke I've busy ever since, good work 1 think of, He confidence me." Koch began giving spectacularly large donations arts sciences. And became patron cancer research, focussing prostate cancer. In addition gifts Sloan-Kettering, gave fifteen million dollars New York- Presbyterian Hospital, hundred twenty-five million M.I.T. cancer research, twenty million Johns Hopkins University, twenty-five million M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston. In response generosity, Sloan- Kettering gave Koch Excellence Corporate Leadership Award. In 2004, President Bush named National Cancer Advisory Board, guides National.Cancer Institute. Koch's corporate political roles, however, may pose conflicts interest. For example, time David Koch casting champion fight cancer, Koch Industries lobbying prevent E.P.A. classifying formaldehyde, company produces great quantities, "known carcinogen" humans. Scientists long known formaldehyde causes cancer rats, several major scientific studies concluded formaldehyde causes cancer human beings—including one published last year National Cancer Institute, •whose advisory board Koch sits. The study tracked twenty-five thousand patients average forty years; subjects exposed higher amounts formaldehyde significantly higher rates leukemia. These results helped lead expert panel within National Institutes Health conclude formaldehyde categorized known carcinogen, strictly controlled government. Corporations resisted regulations formaldehyde decades, however, Koch Industries large funder members Congress stymied E.P.A., requiring defer new regulations studies completed. Koch Industries became major producer chemical 2005, bought Georgia-Pacific, paper wood- products company, twenty-one billion dollars. Georgia-Pacific manufactures formaldehyde chemical division, uses produce various wood products, plywood laminates. Its annual production capacity formaldehyde 2.2 billion pounds. Last December, Traylor Champion, Georgia-Pacific's vice-president environmental affairs, sent formal letter protest federal health authorities. He wrote company "strongly disagrees" N.I.H. panel's conclusion formaldehyde treated known human carcinogen. David Koch recuse National Cancer Advisory Board, divest company stock, company directly lobbying government keep formaldehyde market. (A board spokesperson said issue formaldehyde come up.) James Fluff, associate director National Institute Environmental Health Sciences, division N.I.H., told "disgusting" Koch serving National Cancer Advisory Board: "It's good public health. Vested interests board." He 'went on, "Those boards important. They're influential whether N.C.I. goes formaldehyde not. Billions dollars involved formaldehyde." Harold Vannus, director National Cancer Institute, knows David Koch Memorial Sloan-Kettering, used run. He said that, Sloan-Kettering, "a lot people gave us large business interests. The one thing wouldn't tolerate board members tobacco." When told Koch Industries' stance formaldehyde, Varmus said "surprised." David H. Koch Hall Human Origins, Smithsonian's National Museum Natural History, multimedia exploration theory mankind evolved response climate change. At main entrance, viewers confronted giant graph charting Earth's temperature past ten million years, notes far cooler ten thousand years ago. Overhead, text reads, "HUMANS EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO A CHANGING WORLD." The message, amplified exhibit's Web site, "key human adaptations evolved response environmental instability." Only end exhibit, headline "OUR SURVIVAL CHALLENGE," noted levels carbon dioxide higher ever been, projected increase dramatically next century. No cause given development; mention made possible role played fossil fuels. The exhibit makes seem part natural continuum. The accompanying text says, "During period humans evolved, Earth's temperature amount carbon dioxide atmosphere fluctuated together." An interactive game exhibit suggests humans continue adapt climate change future. People may build "underground cities;" developing "short, compact bodies" "curved spines," "moving around tight spaces problem." Such ideas uncannily echo Koch message. The company's January newsletter employees, instance, argueS "fluctuations earth's climate predate humanity," concludes, "Since can't control Mother Nature, let's figure get along changes." Joseph Romm, physicist runs Web site ClirnateProgress.org, infuriated Smithsonian's presentation. "The whole exhibit whitewashes modern climate issue," said. "I think Kochs wanted seen sort high-minded company, associated greatest natural-history science museum country. But truth is, exhibit underwritten big-time polluters, underground .funders action stop efforts deal threat humanity. I think Smithsonian drawn line." Cristian Samper, museum's director, said exhibit climate change, described Koch "one best donors we've had, tenure here, he's interested content, completely hands off." He noted, "1. don't know details.of involvement issues." The Kochs long depended public's knowing details them. They content operate David Koch called "the largest company you've never heard of." But growing prominence Tea Party, increased awareness Kochs' ties movement, brothers may find harder deflect scrutiny. Recently, President °barna took aim Kochs' political network. Speaking Democratic National Committee fund-raiser, Austin, warned supporters Supreme Court's recent ruling Citizens United case—which struck laws prohibiting direct Corporate spending campaigns—had made even easier big companies hide behind "groups harmless-sounding names like Americans Prosperity." Obama said, "They don't say who, exactly, Americans Prosperity are. You don't know it's foreign-controlled corporation"—or even, added, "a big oil company."
