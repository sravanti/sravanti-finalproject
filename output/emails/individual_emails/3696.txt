That much agreed. But truth actually happened danger lost amid spin inevitable mutual recriminations. The truth this: Chrs.a wrecked talks, intentionally humiliated Barack Obama, insisted awful "dear western leaders would walk away carrying blame. How I know this? Because I room saw happen. China's strategy simple: block open negotiations two weeks, ensure closed-door deal made It look west failed world's poor again. And sure enough, aid agencies, civil society movements environmental groups took bait. The failure "the inevitable result rich countries refusing adequately fairly shoulder overwhelming responsibility", said Christian Aid. "Rich countries bullied developing nations," fumed Friends Earth International. All predictable, complete opposite truth. Even George IVIonbiot, writing yesterday's Guardian, made mistake singly blaming Obama. But I saw Obama fighting desperately salvage deal, Chinese delegate saying "no", again. Monbiot even approvingly quoted Sudanese delegate Lumumba Di-Aping, denounced Copenhagen accord "a suicide pact, incineration pact, order maintain economic dominance countries". Sudan behaves talks puppet China; one number countries relieves Chinese delegation fight battles open sessions. It perfect stitch-up. China gutted deal behind scenes, left proxies savage public. Here's actually went late last Friday night, heads state two dozen countries met behind closed doors. Obama table several hours, sitting Gordon Brown Ethiopian prime minister, Males Zenawi. The Danish prime minister chaired, right sat Ban Ki-moon, secretary-general UN. Probably 50 60 people, including heads state, room. I attached one delegations, whose head state also present time. What I saw profoundly shocking. The Chinese premier, Wen Jinbao, deign attend meetings personally, instead sending second-tier official country's foreign ministry sit opposite Obama himself. The diplomatic snub obvious brutal, practical implication: several times session, world's powerful heads state forced wait around Chinese delegate went make telephone calls "superiors". Shifting blame To would blame Obama rich countries general, know this: China's representative insisted industrialised country targets, previously agreed 80% cut 2050, taken deal. "Why can't even mention targets?" demanded furious Angela Merkel. Australia's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, annoyed enough bang microphone. Brazil's representative pointed illogicality China's position. Why rich countries announce even unilateral cut? The Chinese delegate said no, I watched, aghast, Merkel threw hands despair conceded point. Now know — China bet, correctly, Obama would get blame Copenhagen accord's lack ambition. China, backed times India, proceeded take numbers mattered. A 2020 peaking year global emissions, essential restrain temperatures 2C, removed replaced woolly language suggesting emissions peak "as soon possible". The long-term target, global 50% cuts 2050, also excised. No one else, perhaps exceptions India Saudi Arabia, wanted happen. I certain Chinese room, would left Copenhagen deal environmentalists popping champagne corks popping every corner world. Strong position So China manage pull coup? First, extremely strong negotiating position. China didn't need deal. As one developing country foreign minister said me: "The Athenians nothing offer Spartans." On hand, western leaders particular — also presidents Lula Brazil, Zuma South Africa, Calderon Mexico many others — desperate positive outcome. Obama needed strong deal perhaps anyone. The US confirmed offer $100bn developing countries adaptation, put serious cuts table first time (17% 2005 levels 2020), obviously prepared offer. Above all, Obama needed able demonstrate Senate could deliver China global climate regulation framework, conservative senators could argue US carbon cuts would advantage Chinese industry. With midterm elections looming, Obama staff also knew Copenhagen would probably opportunity go cjinT3t?j..chanQE-3. talks strong mandate. This strengthened China's negotiating hand, complete lack civil society political pressure either China India. Campaign groups never blame developing countries failure; iron rule never broken. The Indians, particular. become past masters ca- opting language equity ("equal rights atmosphere") service planetary suicide — leftish campaigners commentators hoist petard. With deal gutted, heads state session concluded final battle Chinese delegate insisted removing 1.5C target beloved small island states low-lying nations lose rising seas. President Nasheed Maldives, supported Brown, fought valiantly save crucial number. "How ask country go extinct?" demanded Nasheed. The Chinese delegate feigned great offence — number stayed, surrounded language makes meaningless. The deed done. China's game All raises question: China's game? Why China, words UK-based analyst also spent hours heads state meetings, "not reject targets itself, also refuse allow country take binding targets?" The analyst, attended climate conferences 15 years, concludes China wants weaken climate regulation regime "in order avoid risk might called ambitious years' time". This mean China serious global warming. It strong wind solar industries. But China's growth, growing global political economic dominance, based largely cheap coal. China knows becoming uncontested superpower; indeed newfound muscular confidence striking display Copenhagen. Its coal-based economy doubles every decade, power increases commensurately. Its leadership alter magic formula unless absolutely to. Copenhagen much worse another bad deal, illustrated profound shift global geopolitics. This fast becoming China's century, yet leadership displayed multilateral environmental governance priority, viewed hindrance new superpower's freedom action. I left Copenhagen despondent I felt long time. After hope hype, mobilisation thousands, wave optimism crashed rock global power politics, fell back, drained away. [Go]
