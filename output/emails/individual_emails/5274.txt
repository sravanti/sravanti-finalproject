"It's opinion top levels White House Rahm going longer many people think," said senior administration official, speaking condition anonymity. Speculation Emanuel's departure favorite parlor game nearly year — stoked Emanuel's admission he'd love run Chicago mayor (should current' Mayor Richard Daley retire, course), kvetching rigors job, withering attacks left right fact average expiration date chief staff 18 months.
