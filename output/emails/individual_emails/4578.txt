It allows fuzz hard parts negotiation -- "final status" issues, they're often called -- save later, parties amenable pressure. This devotion "constructive ambiguity" hallmark U.S. peacemaking Palestinian-Israeli issue 40 years. Rather state unpalatable concessions analysts recognize required viable settlement -- Israelis must share sovereignty Jerusalem Palestinians must give "right return" Israel -- successive U.S. administrations tried defer unmentionables later. But fog machine blew apart month, isr3e1Interipr i‘,1!inista_rndLinced du ..ripq. visit ily__Vde President Biden Israel would build 1,600 housipg priits ,lerusal. erp. The Obama administration upset, put mildly: Secretary State Hillary Clinton called housing announcement "deeply negative signal" U.S.-Israeli relations "an insult." In ensuing hubbub "crisis" U.S.-Israeli relations, frantic attempts pretend misunderstanding pull cloak ambiguity back peace process. But that's mistake. The East Jerusalem move wasn't accident emphatic public statement Israeli right's rejection concessions Jerusalem. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu trying play along U.S. requests fuzz issue avoiding provocative actions Jerusalem. But right-wing Shas party, controls Interior Ministry, basically called bluff. "Freezing building East Jerusalem one things cannot do," said Dore Gold, right-wing former Israeli ambassador United Nations. And Avigdor Lieberman, Israeli foreign minister settler himself, responded: "Can imagine told Jews New York could build buy Queens?" So administration do, Israeli right put Jerusalem squarely table despite best efforts ambiguity-addicted diplomats? The administration's best strategy considered year ago, state clearly basic principles must frame negotiations. Those guidelines articulated well Zbigniew Brzezinski, former national security adviser: real sharing Jerusalem; right return Palestinians; return 1967 borders, mutual adjustments allow big Israeli settlement blocks; demilitarized Palestinian state. Every negotiation past four decades converged toward parameters. The Obama administration debated whether issue statement principles year ago, began peacemaking effort. Launching negotiations "big bang" made sense officials, including Gen. Jim Jones, national security adviser, But George Mitchell, Middle East envoy, argued based experience Northern Ireland peace talks, better let parties haggle United States stepped bridging proposals. Rather stating U.S. negotiating principles outset, Obama team decided instead push Netanyahu settlements. The administration picked fight flush President Obama's first months office, confident strong Netanyahu weak came showdown, Netanyahu would cave. The Israeli leader coolly bided time, dickering procedural issues Obama got weaker politically month. Netanyahu finally agreed November temporary moratorium new settlements -- excluded Jerusalem. The administration seen coming. In retrospect, seems clear step-by-step approach mistake: Constructive ambiguity, case, proved destructive. It allowed Israeli right wing perpetuate idea could -- obtain peace deal without making concessions Jerusalem. And allowed Netanyahu continue straddle. Jerusalem hardest issue Israeli-Palestinian negotiation, reason, would-be peacemakers wanted save last. But month's crisis makes strategic waffling impossible. Thanks Israeli right, Jerusalem issue joined. What's needed Obama announce negotiations begin, United States state views Jerusalem key issues -- sketching outlines deal Israelis Palestinians want. If Netanyahu refuses play, real crisis U.S.-Israeli relations. davidignatius_@washpost.corn Post Comment View comments posted article.
