143;"I'm heading back from meetings on women, peace and security at NATO. The chief implementer of WPS at DOD also
traveled with me. It was extremely productive. SG Rasmussen chaired a meeting on 1325 today of all the NATO member
and partner ambassadors incl DaIcier. The new NATO special rep for 1325 -- the position sponsored by Norway and
approved at the Chicago summit — gave her inaugural address, and my DOD colleague and I discussed the US efforts
both generally and in Afghanistan. We were followed by extensive remarks from the NATO ambassadors, all of whom
touched on the importance of women's role in security and NATO's mission, as well as applauded US leadership. Many
mentioned you in their interventions! The ambs from Serbia, Azerbaijan and Georgia pointed to their own national
action plans (their existence was a surprise to us), as well as the new structures they have put in place to implement
them. The ambassador from Azerbaijan even said that he is hopeful women will contribute to ending their regional
conflict (I will tell Morningstar). The new special rep - a seasoned diplomat who knows her way around NATO --- wanted
me to ten you how much you have inspired her -- something I hear everywhere!
I'm confident our NATO visit also served to reinforce the importance of the NAP and the US role with our own people
both at NATO and DOD.
I was sorry to miss the discussion with ASSK but there are more events with her tomw. We are working hard on getting
the engagement of Burmese women into the formal peace structures being put in place to end the ethnic conflicts.
I also met with Vivian Redding at the EU who, despite her efforts, is unlikely to get a quota for women on public boards
of directors adopted. She too expressed her admiration of you and your leadership.
In addition to everything that's been said about Chris Stevens, he really understood the important role the women in
Libya were playing in peace and security. Whenever I met with Libyan women at meetings in the region, they went out
of their way to tell me how much he supported them and how much affection they had for him. Such an awful loss.
You've been magnificent throughout all this, despite how wrenching it's been.

When I get back, will work up some ideas on this. Delhi's been enshrouded in smog for the last couple days.
The SEWA project I visited 2 hours outside of Delhi was so impressive. Women who were among the poorst of the poor

Women and work

Dec 30th 2009
From The Economist print edition
The rich world's quiet revolution: women are
gradually taking over the workplace
Getty Images
AT A time when the world is short of causes for celebration, here is a candidate:
within the next few months women will cross the 50% threshold and become the
majority of the American workforce. Women already make up the majority of
university graduates in the OECD countries and the majority of professional
workers in several rich countries, including the United States. Women run many
of the world's great companies, from PepsiCo in America to Areva in France.
Women's economic empowerment is arguably the biggest social change of our
times. Just a generation ago, women were largely confined to repetitive, menial
jobs. They were routinely subjected to casual sexism and were expected to
abandon their careers when they married and had children. Today they are
running some of the organisations that once treated them as second-class
citizens. Millions of women have been given more control over their own lives.
And millions of brains have been put to more productive use. Societies that try to
resist this trend—most notably the Arab countries, but also Japan and some
southern European countries—will pay a heavy price in the form of wasted talent
and frustrated citizens.
This revolution has been achieved with only a modicum of friction (see article).
Men have, by and large, welcomed women's invasion of the workplace. Yet even
the most positive changes can be incomplete or unsatisfactory. This particular
advance comes with two stings. The first is that women are still under-
represented at the top of companies. Only 2% of the bosses of America's largest
companies and 5% of their peers in Britain are women. They are also paid
significantly less than men on average. The second is that juggling work and
child-rearing is difficult. Middle-class couples routinely complain that they have
too little time for their children. But the biggest losers are poor children—
particularly in places like America and Britain that have combined high levels of
female participation in the labour force with a reluctance to spend public money
on child care.
Dealing with the juggle
These two problems are closely related. Many women feel they have to choose
between their children and their careers. Women who prosper in high-pressure
companies during their 20s drop out in dramatic numbers in their 30s and then
find it almost impossible to regain their earlier momentum. Less-skilled women
are trapped in poorly paid jobs with hand-to-mouth child-care arrangements.
Motherhood, not sexism, is the issue: in America, childless women earn almost as
much as men, but mothers earn significantly less. And those mothers' relative
poverty also disadvantages their children.
Demand for female brains is helping to alleviate some of these problems. Even if
some of the new theories about warm-hearted women making inherently superior
workers are bunk (see article), several trends favour the more educated sex,
including the ""war for talent"" and the growing flexibility of the workplace. Law
firms, consultancies and banks are rethinking their ""up or out"" promotion systems
because they are losing so many able women. More than 90% of companies in
Germany and Sweden allow flexible working. And new technology is making it
easier to redesign work in all sorts of family-friendly ways.
Women have certainly performed better over the past decade than men. In the
European Union women have filled 6m of the 8m new jobs created since 2000. In
America three out of four people thrown out of work since the ""mancession""
began have been male. And the shift towards women is likely to continue: by
2011 there will be 2.6m more female than male university students in America.
The light hand of the state
All this argues, mostly, for letting the market do the work. That has not stopped
calls for hefty state intervention of the Scandinavian sort. Norway has used
threats of quotas to dramatic effect. Some 40% of the legislators there are
women. All the Scandinavian countries provide plenty of state-financed nurseries.
They have the highest levels of female employment in the world and far fewer of
the social problems that plague Britain and America. Surely, comes the argument,
there is a way to speed up the revolution—and improve the tough lives of many
working women and their children?
If that means massive intervention, in the shape of affirmative-action
programmes and across-the-board benefits for parents of all sorts, the answer is
no. To begin with, promoting people on the basis of their sex is illiberal and
unfair, and stigmatises its beneficiaries. And there are practical problems. Lengthy
periods of paid maternity leave can put firms off hiring women, which helps
explain why most Swedish women work in the public sector and Sweden has a
lower proportion of women in management than America does.
But there are plenty of cheaper, subtler ways in which governments can make life
easier for women. Welfare states were designed when most women stayed at
home. They need to change the way they operate. German schools, for instance,
close at midday. American schools shut down for two months in the summer.
These things can be changed without huge cost. Some popular American charter
schools now offer longer school days and shorter summer holidays. And, without
going to Scandinavian lengths, America could invest more in its children: it
spends a lower share of its GDP on public child-care than almost any other rich
country, and is the only rich country that refuses to provide mothers with paid
maternity leave. Barack Obama needs to measure up to his campaign rhetoric
about ""real family values"".
Still, these nagging problems should not overshadow the dramatic progress that
women have made in recent decades. During the second world war, when
America's menfolk were off at the front, the government had to summon up the
image of Rosie the Riveter, with her flexed muscle and ""We Can Do It"" slogan, to
encourage women into the workforce. Today women are marching into the
workplace in ever larger numbers and taking a sledgehammer to the remaining
glass ceilings."
143;"spring? He's going to be devastated.
I just came from Georgetown and talked to Jack et al. applied for ""early action"" —that is to be
guaranteed admittance without applying elsewhere. The decision on ""early action"" is based on grades and scores — the
most empirical measures. It is EXTREMELY difficult to be accepted EARLY at Georgetown She was deferred until the
spring — through the regular process when they will weigh all her strengths. There is never any guarantee but this is the
situation for early action.
Everyone is excited about the speech tom'w. I wish I could go but have to be here for another event at State. I've gone
back and forth with speechwriters. I know it will be terrific.

We're making good progress on women's issues."
143;"Your fans are here by the hundreds and eagerly awaiting your speech on the 12th!
As you know the US has been a strong supporter of a new women's agency at the UN that would provide for an Under
Secretary General for women's issues, better coordination and effectiveness and-- consolidation of a group of smaller
entities. In bilats today, I learned that some G77 countries are wondering what's in it for them. They're not developing
countries and they're not the UK or US. Brazil may be second guessing the creation of the new agency yet this is an
agency that will benefit women everywhere. I don't know if you'll have an opportunity to say to Brazil's leader that we
hope the UN women's agency will continue to have their support. In fact Tom Shannon told me that they're really
interested in women's issues and wanted to sign a MOU with us. Sometimes there's a disconnect between NY perm reps
and their capitals
2nd, I don't know if you're still going to Chile. If you talk to Bachelet about her future, you can tell that so many govt reps
at the UN would like to see her head up the new women's agency. It's not clear if she's even interested.
Thx"
143;"I don't know if you'll be speaking to Roza Otunboyeva, the interim leader in Kyrgyzstan, but if you do, it might be
interesting to mention that you know of her commitment to microcredit. She was instrumental in bringing FINCA to
Kyrgyzstan and when you made your trip there you saw what a difference it was making to lift up women and their
families. She also was her country's head of delegation to Beijing. She was foreign minister at the time and made a strong
statement about gender equality and the transformative power of microcredit. I think she had an overseas post when you
visited Kyrgyz so I don't think you met her.
I know it's a very complicated situation there now with our use of the base in potential jeopardy, but I thought this info
might be useful in some way assuming she manages to hold on.
I'm off to Lithuania, Russia and Egypt later today."
143;"(wanted to give you some brief observations from my trip to Lithuania. First of all, their friendship with the US and
respect for you was much in evidence on all levels. Most of the cabinet turned out for the reception that the amb hosted
for me. The FM went out his way to tell me what it meant to get a call from you when he assumed his position (he's
hoping to have a few mins with you in Tallin). As far as Lith has to go, it has achieved some remarkable achievements for
Eastern Eur. They have a female president, Speaker, Finance minister and def. minister. I had a good meeting with the
President and thanked her for Lith commitment to our collective efforts in afghanistan. They run the smallest PRT and,
despite a tough economy, have done everything we've asked in terms of additional support since the surge. The meeting
with the Speaker and top women members of the parl'nt was yet another reminder of your inspiration over many years.
One of the women was at the Vienna W conf and said she's in politics today because of you. Another read about safe
birthing kits in your book and was inspired to send several thousand to Afghanistan. They are eager for more
opportunities to work together.
I came primarily to launch the new working group on gender that we and Lith are co-chairing. There was much gratitude
for our leadership with them in the Community of Democracies.
The meaning of democracy is so strong for people who had to stuggle for it more recently. They really feel this is an
important time to renew the understanding of democ, particularly after the bruising it underwent over the last several
years.
We had terrific turnout from other countries, many comments about you and references to Beijing and Iceland W conf.
(So many people told me the impact Vienna and Iceland had on them). We left our meeting with many commitments for
future concrete projects that will be undertaken. There is great hope that you will be in Krakow in July for the CD
ministerial. The Lith CD coordinator headed to Belgium the next day for an EU meeting. He told me he got a very positive
response for our gender initiative and that Ashton was particularly excited about it. The EU is locating their new gender
institute in Lithuania and they are ager for our help.
The Dutch minister who came
said the outcome of their election in June will say much about the nature of their ongoing commitment in Afg.
Lastly, I arrived shortly after the Polish tragedy. There is a very close relationship between the 2 countries and their grief
was palpable. Jolenta Kwasniewska and several other Poles came to the CD meeting. She told me that they lost so many
of their top leaders across all sectors of society, incl several top women leaders. Jolenta' foundation has been very active
in advancing women's progress in Poland as well as working in other countries."
143;"I had a good visit with her. She very much wants you to come to Egypt for the major anti-trafficking event she is doing in
December and sends you her regards.
Egypt is making good progress on women's issues: prosecuting child marriage cases, combating FGM and they're close to
passing a tough anti-trafficking law. Mrs M is the guiding force.
She and the President appreciated your call after his surgery. The most difficult part of our conversation was
We also announced our partnership with egypt for the training of. Afghan midwives at the suzanne mubarek health

On my way home. The conference was a big success. I met with Cherie Blair on the gender gap in cell phones -
technology that may be even be more tramsformative than microcredit. Phil was with GSMA for the release of their

We'll both be at CGI retreat later this week where we'll raise it as well. She sends her love.

Recruit Afghan women to sell war to Europeans: CIA report
WASHINGTON, March 27, 2010 (AFP) - A CIA expert has called for recruiting Afghan women in a public
relations bid to persuade skeptical Europeans to support the NATO-led war effort, according to a document
leaked Friday.
""Afghan women could serve as ideal messengers in humanizing"" the mission for European audiences,
particularly in France, according to the CIA analysis, posted on WikiLeaks, a whistleblower website.
The views of Afghan women would carry special weight as they could express ""their aspirations for the future,
and their fears of a Taliban victory,"" it said.
The Central Intelligence Agency declined to confirm or deny if the document was genuine. But WikiLeaks has
previously posted government and corporate documents that were later verified.
The report by a CIA expert on ""strategic communications"" and State Department analysts of public opinion
warned that popular support for the war in Europe was weak and could easily collapse, citing the recent fall of
the Dutch government over the issue.
""The tone of previous debate suggests that a spike in French or German casualties or in Afghan civilian
casualties could become a tipping point in converting passive opposition into active calls for immediate
withdrawal,"" it said.
The analysis, dated March 11, suggested public relations strategies to drum up support for the war in Germany
and France, which maintain the third and fourth largest troop deployments in Afghanistan.
""Outreach initiatives that create media opportunities for Afghan women to share their stories with French,
German, and other European women could help to overcome pervasive skepticism among women in Western
Europe toward the ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) mission,"" it said.
Public relations efforts could ""tap into acute French concern for civilians and refugees,"" the report said,
suggesting highlighting polls that show most Afghans support the presence of coalition troops.
Such an approach could stress the potential dangers facing Afghan civilians if NATO-led troops were defeated
and ""leverage French (and other European) guilt for abandoning them.""
""The prospect of the Taliban rolling back hard-won progress on girls I- education could provoke French
indignation, become a rallying point for France's largely secular public, and give voters a reason to support a
good and necessary cause despite casualties.""
For German audiences, marketing efforts should underline how Afghans are reportedly optimistic about the
NATO mission and how an international retreat would damage Germany's interests.
""For example, messages that illustrate how a defeat in Afghanistan could heighten Germany's exposure to
terrorism, opium, and refugees might help to make the war more salient to skeptics,"" it said.
The report also suggested taking advantage of President Barack Obama's popularity in France and Germany,
arguing that appeals from the US president on the importance of the allied role in the war could have a positive
effect.
The memorandum is titled: ""Afghanistan: Sustaining West European Support for the NATO-led Mission -- Why
Counting on Apathy Might Not Be Enough.""

143;"How Come we havent?
This is what we are up against.
Betrayed
They said we were there to save Afghanistan's women. So how
come we haven't?
BY VALERIE M. HUDSON, PATRICIA LEIDL I MAY 10, 2010
One day in November 2009, in Helmand province's capital of Lashkar Gah, a group of Afghan widows and divorcees met
with Patricia, who had been commissioned to write a series of success stories for the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID). All the women were in their 20s, 30s, and 40s but looked to be in their 60s. Until very recently,
none of them could work because they possessed no marketable skills, could neither read nor write, and were at risk of
being killed if they left their homes. A number of women said that, before the program -- which focused on tailoring and
basic literacy -- their children used to weep at night from hunger.

As Patricia prepared to leave, the women fluttered around her like moths, touching her sleeves and speaking all at once.
'What are they saying?"" Pat asked the young Pashto-speaking interpreter. ""They are telling you to go back to your
country and to ask your people not to abandon them. The women of Afghanistan don't want you to leave. They will quite
literally die if the Taliban return,"" she said.
In a recent question-and-answer period at one of our universities, Brigham Young, a student asked Gen. David Petraeus
whether anyone thought to ask the women of Afghanistan how they felt about U.S. hopes to incorporate ""reformed""
Taliban into governance structures as the Americans leave.
Carefully avoiding the word ""women,"" the general assured the questioning student that only ""moderate"" Taliban would be
eligible for such rehabilitation. Left unaddressed was the definition of ""moderate,"" which clearly depends on where you sit:
If you sit in a burqa, there is no such thing as a ""moderate"" Taliban.
Petraeus might find it easy now to sidestep the question of what will happen to Afghanistan's women once the ""moderate""
Taliban come back, but it's likely to haunt him for a long time. Without the security of women there is no security -- and
until we've done more to protect it, we have a moral and practical obligation to stay in Afghanistan.
In 2001, George W. Bush's administration interpreted the first post-invasion photos of Afghan girls heading to school and
of Afghan women unveiling their faces as tangible evidence that conditions were improving in that benighted land. A few
months after the invasion, in his 2002 State of the Union address, Bush announced, ""The last time we met in this
chamber, the mothers and daughters of Afghanistan were captives in their own homes, forbidden from working or going to
school. Today women are free and are part of Afghanistan's new government.""
The Americans strong-armed a handful of women into the loya jirga that then drafted the Afghan Constitution. They
strong-armed a quota for women in the Afghan national legislature -- something that even American women are not
treated to. U.S. troops built schools for girls and pushed for women to be included in the local shuras, and USAID ripped a
page from Greg Mortenson's Three Cups of Tea and facilitated new training and educational opportunities for women.
But the current administration, despite its female secretary of State and its new Office of Global Women's Issues, appears
to be ditching the women of Afghanistan like a blind date gone bad. You have to go back 10 months to find any sustained
rhetoric from President Barack Obama about the importance of assuring the security of women in Afghanistan. Since
then, and especially since last year's Afghan election, those fine words from a sitting president have all but disappeared.
Many of the fine actions are gone, too. Push local shuras into including women in 2002? Yes. Push local shuras into
including women in 2010? Forget it.
It's not difficult to understand why. Afghanistan is in crisis. The cynical policies that characterized the early to mid-stages
of the occupation have come home to roost. President Hamid Karzai and his rogue's gallery of kleptocrats, human rights
abusers, and drug lords are hanging onto power even as Karzai declares open season on the United Nations by accusing
senior bureaucrats of organizing the widespread voter fraud that consolidated his own hold on power.
In the meantime, women have taken a back seat to realpolitik and the exigencies of a coalition exit strategy. But their
suffering is real, as Afghanistan's poverty and chaos affect women possibly most of all. Matemal mortality in Afghanistan
still makes the world's top three list, nine years after the U.S. invasion, resulting in a life expectancy for women of 46. In
the countryside, Taliban zealots spray acid into girls' faces for going to school -- and only 27 percent of them do so in the
first place. According to a recent survey by the U.N. Development Fund for Women, 87 percent of Afghan women report
being beaten on a regular basis.
In July of last year, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) issued a report that represents the most stinging
official condemnation of the Karzai administration's abysmal track record on women to date. The report concluded, ""The
current reality is that ... women are denied their most fundamental human rights and risk further violence in the course of
seeking justice for crimes perpetrated against them."" Last year Karzai pardoned well-connected political thugs who --
before witnesses -- gang-raped a woman with a bayonet. Her husband, who had battled for redress, was assassinated
soon thereafter. Women who dare to speak out against the widespread trampling of their rights face almost certain death
while their murderers face 100 percent impunity.
For the warlords and mujahideen that make up the upper echelons of the Karzai government, the issue of gender equality
was always an unwanted appendage to U.S. involvement -- but one that could easily be dispensed with through the
deployment of flowery speeches and the token appointment of a lone female minister to the Ministry of Women's Affairs.
Indeed, just before his recent ""election,"" Karzai felt secure enough to sign into law a series of repressive measures
designed to repeal what minimal gains women have made since the Taliban ouster.
Although eventually forced to back down over legislation that allows Shiite husbands to rape their wives, Karzai
successfully signed into law other legislation that denies or severely limits women's rights to inherit, divorce, or have
guardianship of their own children. The Shiite Personal Status Law also legalizes forced marriage and the rape of minors.
It allows men to exert almost total control over female relatives and offers them the power to prohibit women's access to
work, education, and health care by denying them the right to leave their homes except for ""legitimate"" purposes. Even
Karzai's own wife -- a doctor whose skills are desperately needed -- is strictly sequestered. And if this sounds bad, just
wait until the Americans leave.
This is not just about women. Gender inequality not only affects girls and women, but boys and men. In Afghanistan,
because women are rarely able to leave the house, very young boys are often forced to carry an unwarranted amount of
financial responsibility, something that limits their prospects as well.
Nor is it even just about Afghanistan. As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in March, ""The subjugation of women is a
threat to the national security of the United States."" On a geopolitical level, Valerie's research has found that states with
higher levels of violence against women are also less peaceful internationally. Indeed, violence against women is a better
predictor of bellicosity than level of democracy, level of wealth, or presence of Islamic civilization. In a 2010 study, Valerie,
along with Brad Thayer, also found high levels of gender inequality to be a strong aggravating factor in the development of
Islamic suicide terrorism.
So, given the desperate need of Afghanistan's women and the serious consequences worldwide, why aren't we doing
more to help? One reason is the fallacious notion, common among coalition members, that Afghan ""culture"" does not
allow for gender equality and that forcing the issue will undermine Western interests. Pat heard this openly from one
coalition representative, who prefers to remain anonymous: 'There is no point in pushing gender equality. It will only
alienate them [Afghans]."" Of course, ""them"" here refers only to men.
But decision-makers forget that culture is not fixed, but is highly mutable and dynamic. More than 30 years ago, Afghan
women were attending universities, teaching, working as doctors, nurses, and professors. Far from being a black hole of
gender apartheid, Afghanistan, though impoverished, was more progressive than many of its Muslim neighbors.
Furthermore, many young Afghans are open to new ways of doing things. In 2009, hundreds of Afghan men and women
bravely stood together in Kabul to protest Karzai's support for a new and oppressive Shiite family law. If Americans
assume that all Afghan men are Neanderthals incapable of sympathizing with the plight of their sisters, they are wrong.
Another, more unmentionable reason may be the chauvinism that permeates Western military culture. U.S. military life,
despite increasing female recruitment and even ""female engagement teams,"" remains a bastion of masculinity, with little
sensitivity toward questions of female rights. For military leadership and recruits alike, immured as they are in an almost
exclusively male world, the complete absence of women from Afghanistan's streets and villages elicited no comment from
the Marines who surrounded Pat, though she as a woman noticed it immediately.
And the ready availability of pornography on U.S. bases, coupled with seamier depictions of life in the West, not only
damages prospects for gender equality but by extension, Western interests. As one young, well-educated 24-year-old
Afghan male pointed out, ""Your culture has no respect for women at all. Look at your pornography and the way you exploit
women in ways that we can't even imagine. Do you call that progress?"" Added another Afghan USAID programmer
working in Gardez, a man in his 50s who is the father of three girls, ""It would be better for the coalition if they could figure
out a way to limit this kind of material.""
We can do better -- much better.
The Obama administration must instill in all military personnel and senior diplomats the necessity of fully protecting
women's rights. Key to that is educating them about how gender equality furthers Western interests and security.
The military should spend less time courting ""moderate"" Taliban and more time showing Afghan community leaders how
gender equality -- including female access to family planning methods -- will result in healthier families, lower maternal
and child death rates, poverty alleviation, and greater self-determination. Gender should be included as a component in all
governance training and should be placed front and center in the upcoming ""peace jirga"" that will include the Taliban.
Indeed, let half of the negotiating team representing the government and the coalition be female: yes, a full 50 percent.
Women must also be represented in the government. As Melanne Verveer, U.S. ambassador at large for global women's
issues, noted last summer, speaking of female politicians in Afghanistan, ""There is only one minister in the cabinet, and
she is powerless. There is a low percentage of women in the civil service. There is only one female governor, in
Bamiyan."" Obama must insist on important changes for women before we leave and make subsequent aid contingent
upon maintenance of a strong presence for women in the Afghan government.
Better yet, the coalition needs to support ""regime change"" through the building of democratic institutions that will groom a
moderate, educated middle class of young women and men to eventually take over. Over two-thirds of the Afghan
population is under the age of 25, which is either a real opportunity for social change -- if they are educated and given a
chance to shape their society in a progressive way -- or a major obstacle, if they find themselves without jobs, unable to
marry, and burdened with retrograde attitudes of what it means to be male and female.
We must hold Afghanistan responsible for its treaty obligations under the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of
Discrimination against Women (CEDAVV) and U.N. Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace, and
security. Afghanistan signed CEDAW without reservations (the United States interestingly, has not), and that means that it
has committed to passing whatever legislation is necessary to implement the wide-ranging principles of gender equality
enshrined in that treaty. This includes taking measures to ensure that women enjoy the same basic human rights and
fundamental freedoms as men, having in place legal and judicial procedures to protect the rights of women, taking
measures to eliminate sexist discrimination, and lastly, submitting national reports every four years to a U.N. advisory
group of international experts, the CEDAW Committee, to ensure transparency on what measures the country has taken
to implement the treaty's provisions.
Unanimously adopted in 2000, UNSC 1325 marked the first time the Security Council recognized the disproportionate and
unique impact of armed conflict on women and stressed the importance of their equal and full participation as active
agents in peace and security.
Needless to say, women do not currently enjoy the same fundamental freedoms as men, and indeed, with the passing of
the Shiite family law, many are worse off than they were before.
To change this, the coalition needs to stay in Afghanistan. Withdrawing at this critical juncture would doom Afghanistan
and the entire region to instability and effectively consign one half of the population to premature death and an existence
not fit for animals.
We are creating a shameful American tradition of leaving women no better off (Afghanistan) -- or even much worse off
(Iraq) -- than before U.S. troops intervened. On the basis of America's track record, women around the world should have
no faith that U.S. soldiers will improve their security. Despite Clinton's remarks on the link between gender equality and
security, on the ground Americans act as if women's well-being, in the end, is not more than peripherally related to the
issue of peace. As we have seen, this view could not be more wrong. Verveer's benchmarks concerning Afghanistan are
the right ones: ""Progress in Afghanistan must be measured not just in military terms, but also in terms of social, political,
and economic participation of women in rebuilding Afghanistan and in the safeguarding of their human rights.""
American women are right to ask why we are sending their sons and daughters to fight and die so that Afghan women can
continue to be treated like an inferior subspecies of humanity. When you break faith with Afghan women, you break faith
with American women. You also break faith with your reasons for being there in the first place.

143;Transcript of Malinowski's meeting with Karzai attached.
143;FYI -- Karl and Zakhilwal have gone to Islamabad to try to close the deal.
143;Fyi
143;"The writer is someone who has worked with Afghan women in developing small businesses in Afghanistan and is doing a
book about the experience.
She went back to Afghanistan for the conference that women had over the weekend and wrote the article that follows
for today's Daily Beast.
Soraya mentioned here is one of our Women of Courage. Gayle (the writer) told me in a separate email that De Mistura
was very sympathetic and said they should be consulted, that the current documents are working documents and he
pledged that the women would be more inovled in the follow up. He also told them that he was very impressed that
they had organized themselves in this 2-day conference to be able to play a more effective role. Zakhilwal was gracious,
but said they were adequately consulted. So it goes.
Secretary Clinton may be one of the highest-profile attendees at Tuesday's Kabul Conference, but
Afghan women fear their opinions won't be heard—and they worry new deals with fighters will roll
back their hard-fought rights.
As Hillary Clinton prepares to attend Tuesday's Kabul Conference, Afghan women are delivering a plain message to
government and international officials: Women's voices should be heard.
""We have to be honest. With respect to the Kabul Conference, we have not been consulted,"" said Soraya Pakzad, founder
of a women's shelter in the western Afghan city of Herat. Her comment came during an unusually heated question-and-
answer session with Afghan Finance Minister Omar Zakhilwal and United Nations representative Staffan de
Mistura marking the end of a two-day women's conference. ""We want to be involved in policy-making. We don't want our
presence to be purely symbolic.""
""Women's rights and achievements should not be compromised in any peace negotiations or
accords.""
The Kabul Conference is, in part, built on symbolism. A follow-up to January's London Conference, the gathering marks
the first time Afghanistan has played host to its international donors, a decision that is intended to showcase the transition
from foreign to Afghan ownership of national priorities. More than 65 international delegations are expected to descend
upon the Afghan capital, which is already enduring security crackdowns and traffic gridlock. Workers could be seen
Sunday painting curbs and planting flowers in advance of the foreigners' arrival.
Discussions will center around five topics, including economic development, agriculture, governance, and security. The
goal of the half-day event is to establish a framework for Afghan leadership in the setting—and execution—of the
country's political and economic direction.
Although it remains to be seen how quickly the Afghan govemment, long under-resourced and beset by allegations of
corruption, will be able to take the reins from its international donors, there is no question that Afghan ownership is the
direction in which things are moving, on the political, economic, and security fronts. And that is precisely why women feel
the stakes for this week's meeting are so high, particularly in light of new deals to empower local militias that might
threaten women's rights.
""After the Kabul Conference, no one knows what else could be on the agenda apart from war escalations and
negotiations,"" said Orzala Ashraf, an Afghan human rights activist. ""This is very important for us, to get a serious and
honest commitment from our government in the presence of all witnesses from the world that our voices will not be
silenced.""
Ashraf and a number of other women's advocates view Tuesday's talks are their last, best shot at speaking out about their
concerns, with help from European and American officials who have been working hard to help them win a seat at the
table. In another show of support, Secretary Clinton and Danish Foreign Minister Lene Espersen will meet Tuesday
morning with a group of women leaders.
Regardless of this high-profile backing, many women say they have little faith in the process to produce anything aside
from more paper and more unkept promises.
""Women are very tired of all these conferences; the government is going to have to show commitments,"" said Selay
Ghaffar, an Afghan Women's Network board member. ""We want things to change.""
And it remains unclear how many Afghans outside Kabul, men or women, are paying attention to yet another gathering to
discuss their future.
""Women in the provinces don't even know about this,"" said Zainab, a young math teacher from Helmand province. ""I
would say 60 percent of women have no idea this is going on.""
Others say the presence of one or two women at the Kabul Conference isn't enough to make a difference. And they say
they fear the recent move from NATO to empower local militias to fight the Taliban, particularly in southern Afghanistan.
""This is very dangerous,"" said Shahida Hussain, a human rights advocate from Kandahar who worked as a community
organizer during the Taliban years. ""We had militias during the communist years and Afghanistan was destroyed. We fear
war again.""
Women leaders say that they want peace and are glad to welcome back former fighters, but only if they respect women's
constitutional guarantee to equal protections under the law.
""Women should be a constituent part of all bodies outlined in the Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Plan,"" said the
women in a statement at the end of their meeting. ""Women's rights and achievements should not be compromised in any
peace negotiations or accords.""
In the meantime, women continue to fight for a voice as Tuesday approaches. After a weeklong flurry of conference calls,
embassy meetings, and lunchtime gatherings, two women aside from government ministers are now slated to speak.
And in a small victory for women, international officials agreed with Pakzad's assessment before pledging that women
would be more involved going forward.
""I agree, you were not consulted,"" said da Mistura, appearing to contradict the Afghan finance minister, who only a few
moments earlier had said that women's views had and would be included. ""As usual, we have been paying lip service to
you and we are all at fault for that.""
Gayle Tzemach Lemmon covered presidential politics as a producer at ABC News in Washington. Since 2005, she has
been reporting on women entrepreneurs starting small and medium-sized businesses in post-conflict economies such as
Afghanistan, Bosnia and Rwanda. She is currently working on a book scheduled for 2010 publication by HarperCollins
about a young Afghan entrepreneur whose business supported her family and community during the Taliban years."

use mullahs to encourage women to make use of clinics. In rural Afghan society, where they are often not allowed to
leave the house without their husband's permission, women are sometimes discouraged from seeking medical care.

child marriage defeat
The defeat of the Child Marriage bill, I fear, is a harbinger of what's to come. After passing the Senate unanimously, there
was every expectation that it would fly through the House on suspension. How this too became an abortion issue is truly
distressing. We have our work more than cut out for us.
On another note, i ran into Ray and Shaista the other night. They were recently in Pakistan and stayed with Zardari the
whole time. It might make sense for someone to brief Ray. Zardari considers him his informal ambassador to the US.

Incoming House Foreign Affairs chairwoman ileana Ros-Lehtinen. (R-FL) defeated a bill Thursday evening that
would have committed the United States to combating forced child marriages abroad, by invoking concerns about
the legislation's cost and that funds could be uses to finance abortions. The episode highlights the tough road that
the °barna administration will face in advancing its women's rights and foreign aid agenda during the next
Congressional session.
Non-governmental organizations, women's rights advocates, and. lawmakers from both parties spent years
developing and lobbying for the ""International Protecting Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act of 2010,"" which
the House failed to pass in a vote Thursday. The bill failed even though 241 Congressmen voted, for it and only 166
voted against, because House Speaker Nancy Petosi (D-CA) brought it up under ""suspension of the rules."" This
procedure has the advantage of not allowing any amendments or changes to the bill, but carries the disadvantage of
requiring two-thirds of the. votes for passage.
; Even still, supporters in both parties fully expected the bill to garner the 290 votes needed -- right up until the bill.
failed. After all, it passed the Senate unanimously Dee. i with the co-sponsorship of several Republicans. including
Appropriations Committee ranking Republican Thad Cochran (R-MS), Foreign Relations Committee member
Roger ‘Vick-er (P.-MS), and human rights advocate Sam Brownback (R-KS).
if passed, the bill would have authorized the president to provide assistance ""to prevent the incidence of child
marriage in developing countries through the promotion of educational, health, economic, social, and legal
empowerment of girls and women."" It would have also mandated that the administration develop a multi-year
strategy on the issue and that the State Department include the incidence of forced child marriage during its annual
evaluation of countries' human rights practices.
So what happened? Ros-Lehtinen first argued that the bill was simply unaffordable. In a Dec. i6""
she objected to the Post of the bill, which would be Si.08 million over five years, and criticized it for not
providing an accounting of how much the U.S. was already spending on this (Alba The '
said the bill would authorize $1o8 million, but would only require $67 million in outlays from fiscal years 2011 to
2015.
Ros-Lehtinen introduced her own version of the bill, which she said would only cost $1 million. But in a fact sheet
gDF.), organizations supporting the original legislation said that Ros-Lehtinen's bill removed the implementation
procedures that gave the legislation teeth. ""Without such activities, the bill becomes merely a strategy with no actual
implementation. And without implementation of a strategy, the bill will have an extraordinarily limited impact,""
they wrote.
Regardless, the supporters still thought the bill would pass because House Republican leadership had not come out
against it. But about one hour before the vote, every Republican House office received a message on the bill
from GOP leadership, known as a Whip Alert, saying that leadership Nyould vote ""no"" on the bill and encouraging all
Republicans do the same. The last line on the alert particularly shocked the supporters.
""There are also concerns that funding will be directed to NGOs that promote and perform abortion and efforts to
combat child marriage could be usurped as a way to overturn pro-life laws,"" the alert read.
The bill doesn't contain any funding for abortion activities and federal funding for abortion activities is already
; prohibited by what's known as the almenè"" which has been boiler plate language in appropriations
bills since 1973.
Invoking the abortion issue sent the bill's supporters reeling. They believed that it was little more than a stunt,
considering that Republican pro-life senators had carefully reviewed the legislation and concluded it would not have
an impact on the abortion issue.
Rep. Stephen LaTourrette (R-OH) - the Republican leadership for invoking the abortion issue to defeat
the forced child marriage act in a floor speech .Friday morning.
""Yesterday I was on the floor and I was a co-sponsor with [on] a piece of legislation with [Rep. Betty McCollum
(D-MN)] that would have moved money, no new money, would have moved money so that societies that are
coercing young girls into marriage... we could make sure that they stay in school so they're not forced into marriage
at the age of 12 and 13,"" LaTourette said. ""Ail of a sudden there was a fiscal argument. When that didn't work people
had to add an abortion element to it. This is a partisan place. I'm a Republican. I'm glad we beat their butt in the
election, but there comes a time when, enough is enough.""
But it was too late for LaTourette and other Republicans who had fought hard for the bill, including Aaron Schoch,
(R-11). The bill is even less likely to pass next year, when the GOP will control the House and Ros-Lehtinen will
control the Foreign Affairs committee.
The main author of the bill was Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), who was incensed when the bill failed
in the House.
-The action on the House floor stopping the Child 'Marriage bill tonight will endanger the lives of millions of women.
and girls around the world,"" Durbin said in a Thursday statement. ""These.voung girls, enslaved in marriage, will be
brutalized and many will die when their young bodies are torn apart while giving birth. Those who voted to continue
this barbaric practice brought shame to Capitol Hill.""
For the NGO and women's advocacy community, the implications of this defeat extend much further than just this
bill. They also saw Republicans invoke the abortion issue when objecting to the International Violence Against
Women Act and expect the new Congress to push for reinstatement of the ""Mexico City Policy,"" which would
prevent federal funding for any organizations that even discuss abortion.
""Any time a health bill that has to do with women and girls comes to the House floor, we're going to see a debate
like the one we just saw,"" said one advocacy leader who supported the bill. ""It's hard to imagine how any
development bills are going to pass in this environment.""
The protection of women and girls is a major focus of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who promised to elevate
the issue Thursday when rolling out the State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. She
has said that forced child marriage is ""a clear and unacceptable violation of human rights"", and that ""the
Department of State categorically denounces all cases of child marriage as child abuse"".
State's Ambassador at Large for Global Women's Issues Melanne Verveer has worked hard on the issue behind
the scenes. But at the eleventh hour, when the going got tough, the bill's supporters said that the administration was
nowhere to be found. In October, the White House decided to waive all penalties under the Child Soldiers
Prevention Act, another Durbin led bill that the NCO community supports.
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimates that 6o million girls in developing countries now between the
ages of 20 and 24 were married before they reached 18. The Population Council,
reproductive and child health, estimates that the number will increase by too million over the next decade if current
trends continue.
!
One of the two biggest problems identified in the Afghanistan-Pakistan Strategy Review released Thursday (?• :) is
the Pakistani militasy's failure to crack down on some of the terrorist groups using Pakistan's tribal areas as a safe
- haven from which to launch attacks across the border into Afghanistan.
Pakistan • a major offensive, involving approximately go,000 troops, against extremists in South
Waziristan in October 2009, and its military has also undertaken efforts to stamp out militants in other border
areas. However, the military has yet to launch offensive military operations in North Waziristan, where insurgent
groups wreaking havoc in Afghanistan reside.
Pakistan's envoy in Washington, Ambassador Husain Haggai* reacted to the report by saying that Pakistan will
engage isla.mist groups in North Waziristan, including the •Hartgani network (no relation), but only when there is
sufficient support in all areas of Pakistan's government for the effort, and not until they are confident that the
mission can be completed effectively.
""Pakistan has made it very clear that we are fighting terrorists because they are a threat to our own existence as a
modern democratic nation. We will fight all groups in all parts of our country,"" Haqqani said in an exclusive
interview with The Cable. ""But we will follow timelines that suit our own capabilities and can lead to success.""
Haqqani said that the Pakistani army, which has taken the fight to six out of the seven regions inside Pakistan in
which domestic militant groups operate and suffered thousands of casualties in the process, is simply not in a
position to expand its war on the extremists now.
""Right now, it's only a question of operational capability and readiness. Our armed forces have been engaged in
dealing with flood relief work,"" he said. ""We have to see what resources we will allocate in which part of the country,
and those rather than any political factors are responsible for any waiting period.""
He also noted that ""there is a fragile consensus in Pakistan in favor of military action against regional elements,""
and that Pakistan's government has no choice but to make the decision to attack North Waziristan groups on a
timeline that prioritized Pakistani considerations over American ones.
""Sometimes it's easy for our allies to tell us what to do and for us to tell our allies what to do. But everyone makes
decisions based on their own perceptions and analysis of on ground realities,"" Haqqani said.
In several discussions with other Pakistani officials, an even more complicated picture of the Pakistani position on
attacking groups in North Waziristan emerges. The Pakistanis largely believe that the U.S. government is being
unrealistic in terms of the timelines it wants for cracking down on terrorist safe havens along the Afghanistan-
Pakistan border, which have existed for decades.
, ""There will always be a gap between our two countries because the Americans want things done quickly and done
their way,"" another Pakistani government official said.
; A third senior Pakistani official said that many Pakistanis feel that the ()barna administration is placing too much of
the blame on Pakistan for the lank of progress in the 'U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.
'The U.S. keeps telling Pakistan to do more, but Pakistan keeps telling the U.S. to do more on certain questions such
as speeding up building up of Afghan army, establishing a real process toward reconciliation, and providing
Pakistan the means for large scale operations,"" the official said.
The United States has provided Pakistan with several billions of dollars in military and economic aid to support its
war against domestic insurgents. But many in the Pakistani government have criticized what they say characterize
as the slow arrival of these funds, which they say are in any case too small to address Pakistan's severe problems.
""It's very simplistic to measure success in amount of assistance provided to Pakistan,"" one Pakistani official said.
In remarks delivered during the rollout of the strateu review Thursday, President Obama was diplomatic when
discussing his administration's ongoing drive to push Pakistan to do more in North Waziristan.
""Increasingly, the Pakistani government recognizes that terrorist networks in its border regions are a threat to all
our countries, especially Pakistan. We've welcomed major Pakistani offensives in the tribal regions. We will
continue to help strengthen Pakistanis' capacity to root out terrorists,"" said Obama. ""Nevertheless, progress has not
come fast enough. So we will continue to insist to Pakistani leaders that terrorist safe havens within their borders
must be dealt with.""
Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy acknowledged in an interview the same day that there
was more work to be done on the relationship before the Pakistanis were willing to fully support the U.S. and
NATO-led mission in Afghanistan.
""Given the ups and downs of our historical relationship with Pakistan, they fear our abandonment,"" she said. ""Their
calculus is very much affected by the long-term commitment they feel from us and in working in a strategic
partnership.""
The White House recognizes that its efforts have fallen short so far. ""The bottom line is that Pakistan is a country
where we have little influence, little access and little credibility,"" one of Obama's aides to■..-:), The New York Times.
The administration's official line, therefore, is to agree with the Pakistani government and express sensitivity to its
claim that they simply can't expand their war against extremists at this time.
""We would like them to move tomorrow, we would like them to take out these people tomorrow,"" the new U.S.
Ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter. ""But we understand they're telling us honestly about the capacity of
their military, and when they are able, we are convinced they will move in.""
But for many in Washington, the open-ended delay in Pakistan.s promise to expand military operations into North.
Waziristan represents a strategic choice, and is not just a result of the military's operational limitations. But
whatever Pakistan's reasons, the delay doesn't inspire confidence that the Obama administration can meet its
timelines for making progress in Afghanistan.
""Pakistan, meanwhile, iS hedging its bets, supporting proxy actors like the Quetta Shura Taliban and Haos
iani
Network that might counter Indian interests in Kabul after the United States and its allies eventually withdraw,""
Andrew Extnn of the Center for a New American Security. 'The insurgent sanctuaries in Pakistan are one of
the two Achilles heels in the NATO strategy.""

Posted: 17 Dec iOO C 4:42 AM PST
In a rare instance of bipartisanship, the House of Representatives moved to pass a resolution Friday honoring the
life and work of the recently departed Ambassador Richard Holbrooke.
The resolution C, was sponsored by outgoing House Appropriations State and Foreign Ops
Subcommittee chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-NY), and cosponsored by incoming House Foreign Affairs chairwoman
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Howard Berman (D-CA), and Mike Turner (R-OH). The bill is ""a concurrent
resolution honoring the exceptional achievements of Ambassador Richard Holbrooke and recognizing the
significant contributions he has made to United States national security, humanitarian causes and peaceful
resolutions of international conflict.""
""The passing of Ambassador Holbrooke on Monday, December 13th, is a great loss for the American people,"" Lowey
said in a statement. ""One of our nation's most talented diplomats, Richard Holbrooke possessed a fierce
determination and unsurpassed brilliance in advocating for American security, diplomatic, and development
interests around the world - in Southeast Asia and post-Cold War Europe, at the United Nations, and most recently
in Afghanistan and Pakistan. His exceptional accomplishments as a peace-maker, diplomat, writer, scholar,
manager and mentor will define his legacy as one of the true great foreign policy giants of our time.""
Ros-Lehtinen praised Holbrooke as ""one of the most consequential world diplomats of the last half-century,"" and
said that ""his tireless work in pursuit of United States national interests and international peace have put us all in
his debt.""
After praising his career -- which included two stints as assistant secretary of state, peace negotiator in the Balkans,
U.S. ambassador to the U.N., and service as U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan -- Ros-
Lehtinen called for reform of the United Nations and protection of Israel within its bodies.
""In New York at the UN, [Holbrooke] did much of the heavy lifting on Congressionally-led efforts to rein in UN
spending, to make more equitable the dues paid by the United States, and to improve the standing of Israel in that
multinational body,"" she said. ""Sadly, those concerns have returned with a renewed urgency -- with the need for
fundamental reform of UN budget and the virulently anti-Israel UN Human Rights Council -- and the Congress can
only hope to have such a tenacious, principled partner in the future.""

Thank you for reaching out to Secretary Solis and convincing her to join the Verification Commission. She and Ricardo

We will meet with her this morning at 10 am to brief her for Tuesday's journey to Honduras. At this point, it appears we
have a military aircraft available. The plan is for the U.S. Delegation to depart D.C., stop in Miami to pick up Ricardo
Lagos, and arrive in Tegucigalpa together. We think this will send a powerful message to Hondurans and leave no doubt
about our commitment to seeing this process through to a successful conclusion.
You should be aware that Ambassador Hugo Llorens is under public assault. The Wall Street Journal dedicates its
America's column this morning to attacking him and calling for his removal. Last Friday, Representative Connie Mack did
the same. This chorus will grow as the extent of our accomplishment is understood. Llorens is a tough, stalwart guy. He
and his Mission have held firm during this crisis. A call from you would be a big boost.
Finally, we will hold an IPC today to identify further steps. We will keep you up to date on these steps and identify
further opportunities for your engagement.
I want to thank you for your leadership and support during this long crisis. Your willingness to engage at key moments
and take risks at the right time have propelled us much further than anyone expected. Your diplomacy prevented a
