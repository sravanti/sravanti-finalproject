This it. Pretty uncompelling piece ask me, course I'm biased. Mitt Romney: A New Course Middle East Restore three sinews American influence: economic strength, military strength strength values. Disturbing developments sweeping across greater Middle East. In Syria, tens thousands innocent people slaughtered. In Egypt, Muslim Brotherhood come power, country's peace treaty Israel hangs In balance. In Libya, ambassador murdered In terrorist attack. U.S. embassies throughout region stormed violent protests. And Iran, ayatollahs continue move full tilt toward nuclear-weapons capability, promising annihilate Israel. These developments not, President Obama says, mere "bumps road." They major issues put security risk. Yet amid upheaval, country seems mercy events rather shaping them. We're moving direction protects people allies. And that's dangerous. If Middle East descends chaos, Iran moves toward nuclear breakout, Israel's security compromised, America could pulled maelstrom. We still time address threats, require new strategy toward Middle East The first step understand got here. Since World War II, America leader Free World. We're unique earned role conquest promoting human rights, free markets rule law. We ally like-minded countries, expand prosperity trade keep peace maintaining military second none. But recent years, President Obama allowed leadership atrophy. Our economy stuck "recovery" barely deserves name. Our national debt risen record levels. Our military, tested decade war, facing devastating cuts thanks budgetary games played White House. Finally, values misapplied—and misunderstood—by president thinks weakness win favor adversaries. By failing maintain elements influence stepping away allies, President Obama heightened prospect conflict instability. He understand American policy lacks resolve provoke aggression encourage disorder. The Middle East case point. The Arab Spring presented opportunity help move millions people oppression freedom. But also presented grave risks. We needed strategy success, president offered none. And seeks downplay significance calamities past weeks The incomprehension afflicts president's policy toward Israel. The president began term explicit policy creating "daylight" two countries. He recently downgraded Israel "closest ally" Middle East "one closest allies." It's diplomatic message received clearly Israel adversaries alike. He dismissed Israel's concerns Iran mere "noise" prefers "block out." And time Israel needs America stand it, declined meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In period uncertainty, need apply coherent strategy supporting partners Middle East—that is, governments individuals share values. This means restoring credibility Iran. When say Iranian nuclear-weapons capability—and regional instability comes it--is unacceptable, ayatollahs must made believe us. It means placing daylight United States Israel, And means using full spectrum soft power encourage liberty opportunity long known corruption oppression. The dignity work ability steer course lives best alternatives extremism. But Middle East policy undermined unless restore three sinews influence: economic strength, military strength strength Of values. That require different set policies President Obama pursuing.

The United States deplores intentional effort denigrate religious beliefs others. At meeting earlier today, colleague, foreign minister Morocco, said prophets respected symbols humanity, humanity. But us crystal clear paramount message: There never justification violent acts kind. And look leaders around world stand speak violence, take steps protect diplomatic missions attack. Think it.

When us people faith - I one — feel pain insults, misunderstanding, denigration cherish, must expect others resort violence, That universal standard expectation, everyone's obligation meet that, make differences, expect less expect others, You cannot respond offensive speech violence without begetting violence. And I strongly believe great religions world stronger insults. They withstood offense centuries. Refraining violence, then, sign weakness one's faith; absolutely opposite, sign one's faith unshakable. So tonight, must come together recommit working toward future marked understanding acceptance rather distrust, hatred, fear. We pledge whenever one person speaks ignorance bigotry, ten voices answer. They answer resoundingly offense insult, answering ignorance enlightenment, answering hatred understanding, answering darkness light; one person commits violent act name religion, millions stand condemn strength. In times like these, easy despair differences irreconcilable, mountains steep climb; therefore never reach level understanding peacefulness seek, I believe great religions world call us pursue. But that's I believe, I don't think it's believe either tonight. Part makes country special keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing future. We keep supporting next generation, believing young people keep us moving forward positive direction. So tonight I think it's important talk better tomorrow seek, also things — real, practical, tangible things — young people help shape better future.

Just wanted sure saw Kurtzer op-ed, ran Sunday Post. Kudos Jonathan Prince getting written placed. The Settlements Facts • By Daniel Kurtzer Sunday, June 14, 2009 Faulty analysis Israeli settlement issue passed fact. Charles Krauthanuner's June 5 column, "The Settlements Myth," one example. Here facts: In 2003, Israeli government accepted, reservations, "road map" peace, imposed two requirements Israel regarding settlements: "GO! [Government Israel] immediately dismantles settlement outposts erected since March 2001. Consistent Mitchell Report, GOI freezes settlement activity (including natural growth settlements)." Today, Israel maintains three events -- namely, draft understandings discussed 2003 Prime Minister Ariel Sharon U.S. deputy national security adviser Stephen Hadley; President George W. Bush's April 14, 2004, letter Sharon; April 14 letter Sharon adviser Dov Weissglas national security adviser Condoleezza Rice -- constitute formal understanding United States accepted continuing Israeli building within "construction line" settlements. The problem understanding. The first event Israelis cite 2003 discussions four-part draft included notion construction within settlements might permitted confined already built-up areas settlements. The idea draw line around outer perimeter built-up areas settlements allow building inside line. This draft never codified, effort made define line around built-up areas settlements. Nonetheless, Israel began act largely accordance reading provisions, probably believing U.S. silence conferred assent. Second, President Bush's 2004 letter conveyed U.S. support agreed outcome negotiations Israel would retain "existing major Israeli population centers" West Bank "on basis mutually agreed changes. . . ." One key provisions letter U.S. support Israel's retaining settlements predicated "agreed outcome" negotiations. Despite Israel's contention letter allowed continue building large settlement blocs Ariel, Maale Adumim Gush Etzion, letter convey U.S. support understanding Israeli settlement activities areas run-up peace agreement. In 2004 letter Rice, Weissglas addressed issue "construction line," saying "within agreed principles settlement activities, effort made next days better definition construction line settlements Judea & Samaria." However, never "agreed principles settlement activities." Moreover, effort define "construction line" never consummated: Israel United States discussed briefly reach agreement definition construction line settlements. Weissglas's letter also promised "continuous action" remove unauthorized outposts, Israel removed almost none them. Throughout period, Bush administration regularly protest Israel's continuing settlement activity. But different arguing United States agreed it. In recent days, former senior Bush administration officials told journalists background understandings existed Israel regarding continued settlement activity. Commentators also focus Obama administration's reiteration freeze must include "natural growth" settlements. Krauthammer says "means strangling death thriving towns close 1949 armistice line. . . It means increase population. Which means babies." This nonsense. No one suggests Israelis stop babies. Rather, blessing new baby translate right build apartments houses settlements. The two issues nothing other. Israelis, like Americans, move time life circumstances -- children, jobs, housing availability -- change. The pattern population growth territories actually undercuts natural-growth argument. Since 1993, Israel signed Oslo Accords, Israel's West Bank settler population grown 116,300 289,600. The numbers East Jerusalem increased 152,800 186,000. This goes far beyond natural increase families already living settlements. Inserting provision "natural growth" official documents started 2001 Mitchell Report 2003 "road map," reflecting recognition concept abused justification expanding settlements.

ebeigetu flork antes Just FYI. Palau UN Amb. Beck says friends law school & thought recognized came w/Pres. Toribiong. Hope you're pain mend soon. Jeff June 20, 2009 The Myth $12 Million Uighur . By STUART BECK CONGRATULATIONS Palau. Our little country, group islands 500 miles east Philippines, become, briefly, household word. President Obama, much admired Palau, asked new president, Johnson Toribiong, United States favor: Please accept, refugees, group innocent Chinese Muslims. They anti-American terrorists, victims human rights violations, landed Guantanamo Bay seven years. Innocent, stateless, harmless. President Toribiong, lawyer trained University Washington highly regarded litigator, told President Obama Secretary State Hillary Clinton needed assure people Uighurs indeed harmless, could integrated Palau's small, diverse friendly culture. Assuming due diligence brought satisfactory results, Palau would pleased give refugees temporary residence. Last weekend, dispatched number officials Guantanamo interview Uighurs review records. One would thought positive gesture friendship staunch American ally would applauded, least United States. Instead, reasons beyond me, unattributed leaks unsubstantiated rumors twisted Palau's act decency another grab dollars cunning third-world country. In breaking story Palau amenable President Obama's request, Associated Press reported two anonymous State Department officials linked Palau's acceptance Uighurs $200 million payoff. Almost immediately, much news media took bait, math asserted Palau getting nearly $12 million dollars per Uighur. Within day two, The Wall Street Journal pontificating shakedown. Before story gets far hand, let's consider facts. It true United States Palau economic relationship. Palau receiving American aid since wrested Japanese 1944. (Over past 15 years, averaged $56 million year.) This aid come strings; United States always insisted Palauan government ready promptly turn land bases security United States Palau require it. B6 In 1994, two countries agreed 50-year option allows United States use Palau military purposes. That agreement's economic terms expire October 2009, new economic package remaining 35 years works — time. But never mention $200 million. And one even hinted linking deal Palau's acceptance Uighurs. The United States simply offered pay relocation costs Uighurs less $90,000 per person cover transportation, food, housing medical help men get oriented get jobs. Palau small peaceful community. Its constitution bans weapons kinds. Capital crimes virtually unknown. Social life revolves around family. Children wander house house. Could anyone believe leaders Palau would risk safety serenity modern Eden exchange money? Is plausible close-knit people would countenance presence terrorists midst? I assure answer no. Last week, Palauans lowered flags half-staff memory Sgt. Jasper Obakrairur, Palauan joined United States Marines died June 1 helping root Taliban Afghanistan. He fourth Palauan serviceman die recent years, following fallen comrades American uniform Cpl. JayGee Meluat, Cpl. Meresebang Ngiraked Specialist Philton Ueld.

The alternative would administration say: a. We come long way, Israel made unprecedented commitments U.S. terms settlements freeze. This welcome development. b.

Apparently can't get away me. We're sharing FT op-ed page tomorrow. Here's piece.... Thanks Friday. Much favorable comment. Good luck UNGA. President Barack Obama's announcement new system.for protecting America's allies Iranian missiles ignited charges scaling back one inherited George W. Bush concession Russians. In fact, Obama plan big improvement Bush one, designed counter evolving Iranian threat, mollify Russian anxieties. Mr Bush's decision put 10 missile interceptors Poland associated radar Czech Republic based concern Iran developing long-range rockets could hit US. The Bush system would less effective shorter- range Iranian missiles, would left much Europe, notably including America's ally Turkey, unprotected. Over last several years, Iranians shifted efforts developing long-range rockets deploying large numbers shorter-range ones pose immediate danger southeastern Europe Middle East, well US forces stationed there. Unlike Mr Bush's, Mr Obama's plan quickly field missile-defence capability address existing threat. It upgraded deal longer-range Iranian missiles future. The Central Europeans reacted decision apprehension alarm recognize replacement conceptually flawed plan credible one strengthens bonds transatlantic defence. The view Moscow clouded outright paranoia. Military experts suspected US rockets Poland, advertised defensive, could used offensively, even pre-emptively, Russia. Laying rest far-fetched scenario prime motivation Mr Obama's decision, been. However, removing gratuitous irritant bilateral relations, president improved prospects US-Russian arms control negotiations underway Geneva. Those talks could produce December new treaty reducing numbers strategic - is, intercontinental — weapons. If ratified US Senate (which easy, given ferocity partisan wars Washington), US Russia track reductions future. Mr Obama Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, due meet New York week, jointly called eventual goal eliminating nuclear weapons. As successors take steps direction, grapple stark paradox nuclear age: mutual deterrence depends side vulnerable retaliation other. If either side enough defences trump side's offence, mutuality deterrence breaks one sides hair-trigger, making war likely crisis. American statesmen pounded inescapable truth heads initially sceptical Soviet counterparts 40 years ago. The result Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty signed Richard Nixon Leonid Brezhnev 1972. By limiting defensive capability superpowers, ABM treaty necessary companion piece series treaties setting ceilings offensive weaponry. Because nuclear weapons expected us forever, ABM treaty meant last perpetuity. While Soviets converted logic restricting defence, Ronald Reagan not. The late US president championed development space-based comprehensive shield would make offensive weapons — therefore mutual deterrence — "impotent obsolete." Many experts believed Reagan's vision, derisively nicknamed Star Wars, impossible dream. So successor, George H. W. Bush, treated program benign neglect negotiating Russians Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) begun Mr Reagan. The second president Bush reversed father's policy. He greatly weakened START process, pulled US ABM treaty sought revive national missile defence (NMD) system. His decision build interceptor radar sites Poland Czech Republic was, one aides told time, large measure "pouring concrete eventually global NMD." Key officials Obama administration — including president himself, studied arms control college — understand linkage reduction offences regulation defences. However, avoided raising issue context last week's decision. That partly want plan judged merits, vis-à-vis Iranian threat. But enough fights Republicans without energizing right wing trying reinstate principles ABM treaty. Yet sooner later US administration grasp nettle regulating strategic defences. Otherwise, continued reductions strategic nuclear offences either impossible or, worse, dangerous. The author president Brookings Institution.

Counseling That Helps Dying Live By Devin Talbott Strobe Talbott Saturday, August 29, 2009 Many opponents health-care reform concentrated fire provision House legislation would provide government reimbursement doctors offer end-of-life counseling. How society deals confronting death understandably controversial. Unfortunately, debate degenerated cacophony demagoguery distortion, including invocations Hitler fear-mongering "death panels." As result attacks, number senators key determining bill emerge Congress abandoned support end-of-life counseling. Our family's experience year provided vivid perspective value service misguidedness campaign it. Brooke Shearer -- wife, mother grandmother -- fighting cancer year. She undergone major surgery, numerous scans biopsies, two debilitating courses chemotherapy. Her doctors among best fields. Their expertise not, however, extend fine points of, latest advances in, pain management. Brooke determined maintain highest possible quality life family whatever time together. With goal mind, sought advice treatment palliative-care specialists Washington Home Community Hospices. Their ingenuity skill adjusting medications significantly alleviated discomfort final months. Working closely primary physicians, hospice staff helped Brooke anticipate likely course disease way allowed make decisions exercise degree control condition family's adjustment it. When oncologist concluded chemotherapy working, Brooke put fully hands Washington Home outpatient. Regular house calls hospice doctors, nurses social workers enabled stay active professional projects, spend time friends family, end life home, considerable comfort us. These, issues cost, principal considerations family. However, controlling cost health care -- especially last year life -- important part current national debate. Therefore worth noting Brooke's treatment last stages illness far less expensive previous year. It often said dying full-time job. That emphatically case Brooke. Until final days, concentrated living -- choice end-of-life counseling helped make possible. Hospice care meets standard Hippocratic oath: It harm -- good; hastening death enhancing life. If counseling hospice services palliative care beneficiary health care reform, many Americans well. Devin Talbott, along brother Adrian, co-founder GenerationEngage.

Since day government sworn eight months ago, calling direct negotiations Palestinians. During time, taken many concrete actions improve daily life Palestinians create climate political negotiations would best chance succeed. We dismantled hundreds roadblocks checkpoints, extended hours operation Allenby Bridge removed bureaucratic obstacles Palestinian economic development. These actions helped spur surge, boom, Palestinian economy. At time, security environment improved thanks efforts IDF efforts better trained PA security forces. Now wish add improved economic security climate meaningful political negotiations. I already said build new settlements would expropriate additional land existing settlements. I said would also restrain settlement activity, that's exactly decided today. I promised enable normal life continue three hundred thousand Israeli citizens, brothers sisters, live Judea Samaria. That suspension affect construction currently underway. It include schools, kindergartens, synagogues public buildings necessary continuation normal life time period suspension. Obviously, infrastructure may needed protect national security safeguard lives citizens also provided time. Regarding Jerusalem, sovereign capital, position well known. We put restrictions building sovereign capital. As always, committed protect freedom worship faiths ensure equal fair treatment city's residents, Jews Arabs alike. When suspension ends, government revert policies previous governments relation construction. I want say clearly Palestinians: Now time begin negotiations. Now time move peace process forward.

It's really tragedy brothers wrongfully detained Guantanamo makes clear Palau U.S. great service courageous regard world (although Palau many ways vulnerable China): The Secretary complimenting Pres. Toribiong re good move right Alcy upset Palauans (as feared) meeting I give confidential report separately. Jeff 2 Brothers' Grim Tale Of Loyalty And Limbo To Leave Guantanamo Means Abandoning Family By Del Quentin Wilber Washington Post Staff Writer Monday, September 28, 2009 Bahtiyar Mahnut, detainee U.S. military prison Guantanamo Bay, learned weeks ago Pacific island nation Palau invited settle there. It cause celebration, especially man desperately wants free. But, surprise attorneys, Bahtiyar turned offer. He wishes remain prisoner, say, look older brother, fellow detainee. The brothers' saga, related attorneys military records, could transpire context Guantanamo Bay comes critical juncture Obama administration, struggling meet Jan. 22 deadline shutter 223-detainee prison. Their circumstances also highlight diplomatic difficulties facing U.S. government tries find places send prisoners destined terrorism trials United States. The brothers Uighurs, residents China considered separatists Beijing enemies United States. The brothers picked separately Afghanistan Pakistan soon United States launched attacks al-Qaeda Taliban retaliation Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Since least 2003, U.S. government tried find homes brothers 20 captured Uighurs. Five went Albania 2006; four sent Bermuda June. At one point, U.S. officials considering possibility resettling Uighurs D.C. region, plan scuttled political pressure. Most countries reluctant accept Uighurs risk angering China. In recent weeks, however, Palau agreed accept 12 13 remaining Uighurs, according Justice Department. The detainee invited Palau Bahtiyar's older brother, Arkin Mahmud, 45, developed mental health problems apparently serious treated sparsely populated country, said attorney, Elizabeth Gilson. To make matters worse, according Gilson military records, Arkin prisoner went searching Bahtiyar younger brother left homeland eight years ago. "This difficult sad," said Abubakkir Qasim, 40, Uighur freed Guantanamo Bay 2006 considers friend brothers. "Bahtiyar turning away freedom brother," Qasim said interpreter. "His brother Bahtiyar. I feel sorry them." Five Uighurs declined offer variety reasons, according one attorneys, Susan Baker Manning. The Justice Department says government thinks six eight Uighurs go Palau. The earliest could leave would Thursday, Justice Department says. Officials Defense State departments Palau Embassy Washington either declined comment return phone messages. In 2001, Bahtiyar Arkin, Muslims, living parents younger brother small house bustling Ghulja Western China. Arkin father two children, 8 5. The brothers particularly devout felt oppressed government Beijing, allow worship ensures best jobs go ethnic Chinese. The brothers forced survive menial tradesmen. Bahtiyar sold clothes; Arkin repaired shoes. Bahtiyar wanted strike own. So, $700 pocket, headed Pakistan. But quickly ran money couldn't find work. He worried sent back China friend told group Uighurs Afghanistan wanted "to fight Chinese government." "If I went," told military officials, "I didn't pay food anything. So I went Afghanistan." There, lived 35 Uighurs camp dusty roads shacks southern mountains. The group built houses mosque. They trained one automatic rifle push-ups, pull-ups calisthenics, records show. Within weeks arriving camp, Bahtiyar managed call home. His mother worried told Arkin find brother. "He left dutiful son," Gilson said. After Sept. 11 attacks, U.S. military began bombing Afghanistan destroyed Bahtiyar's camp, sending Uighurs mountains shelter. Bahtiyar others crossed neighboring Pakistan, arrested turned U.S. authorities. Meanwhile, Arkin made way Afghanistan, captured Northern Alliance turned United States. At military prison Kandahar, brothers saw across razor wire. In 2002, military brought brothers 20 Uighurs Guantanamo Bay. Authorities alleged time men trained military-style camps affiliated Taliban al-Qaeda. The accusations later dissolved upon close scrutiny courts. Arkin Bahtiyar confined separate cells and, months, able talk. A Uighur interpreter working military, Rushan Abbas, persuaded military 2003 allow brothers meet interrogation room. When saw other, hugged wept. "It emotional," Abbas said. "These brothers across world coming together interrogation room first time." In 2005, Arkin remained solitary confinement. He record disciplinary infractions disrespectful guards, records show. Not first time, Bahtiyar took steps help brother. Living relaxed part prison, granted request moved Arkin's camp. "I missed brother much," told military officials. By next year, brothers cleared release military. The government present evidence justify detention federal lawsuit brought Uighurs seeking freedom. In October, judge ordered freed United States, decision overturned appeal. The Uighurs awaiting word, expected week, whether Supreme Court hear case. Last year, remaining Uighurs moved fenced-in camp includes activities room, video games books. Through all, Arkin Bahtiyar struggled cope prisoners, perhaps years come. "I know I'll die here," Arkin told Gilson long ago. "In China, least I would trial sentence." Since taking case 2005, Gilson met Arkin dozens times. But spoken Bahtiyar phone. He refused meet her, frustrated lawyers always talking considered fruitless legal victories. Two weeks ago, changed mind. Bahtiyar felt owed explanation refusing Palau's generous offer. "Every day eternity," told Gilson interpreter. "But I look brother." Jeffrey L. Farrow

Levin opposed surge, voted funding troops. Pasted Levin's speech troops Afghanistan. We'll copy well. Afghan speech FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE September 11, 2009 Contact: Senator Levin's Office Phone: 202.224.6221 Senate Floor Speech - Surge Afghan Army Remarks prepared delivery Today mark solemn anniversary. Eight years ago morning, nation attacked terrorist extremists motivated hatred bent destruction. It always appropriate remember shock day, innocent lives lost, efforts nation made since day ensure Afghanistan, nation hosted terrorists, cannot become safe haven terrorists seeking attack us. But today especially appropriate occasion take stock efforts, consider best continue them. I recently returned trip Afghanistan, I joined colleagues Senators Jack Reed Ted Kaufman. The situation Afghanistan serious. Security deteriorated. But take right steps, ensure Afghanistan revert Taliban-friendly government could provide safe haven al Qaeda terrorize us world. The Obama administration's new strategy, focusing securing Afghan population's safety partnering Afghan security forces effort, important start reversing situation Afghanistan. The change strategy led forces, words General McChrystal's Counterinsurgency Guidance, "live, eat train together [with Afghan security forces], plan operate together, depend one another, hold accountable....and treat equal partners success." The Guidance goes say success Afghan security forces "is goal." To achieve goal increase accelerate efforts support Afghan security forces efforts become self-sufficient delivering security nation — consider whether increase U.S. combat forces levels already planned next months. These steps include increasing size Afghan Army police much faster presently planned; providing trainers Afghan Army police presently planned; providing equipment presently planned; working separate local Taliban fighters leaders attract side government Iraq. While security situation Afghanistan worsened, still important advantages there. The Afghan people hate Taliban. Public opinion polls show support Taliban 5%. In addition, Afghan army highly motivated troops proven fighters. Despite advantages, face significant challenges. General McChrystal believes, I agree, need regain initiative create momentum towards success. General McChrystal worries, rightly so, perception lost initiative, impact perception Afghan people, government, al Qaeda Taliban. By contrast, dispel perception, chance convince local lower- level Taliban fighters lay arms rejoin Afghan society. I believe effective way retake initiative Afghanistan series steps ensure Afghanistan's army police manpower, equipment support secure nation. First, increase troop levels Afghan army police faster currently planned. There approximately 90,000 troops Afghan army now, number scheduled go 134,000 October 2010. The Afghan police scheduled reach level 82,000 time. For long time, many us urged establishment goal 240,000 Afghan troops 160,000 Afghan police 2013. The Afghan Minister Defense strongly supported numbers. It appears government Afghan government prepared accept goals. But need additional Afghan forces urgent. I believe possible essential advance goals year, 2012. Our military Afghanistan repeatedly pointed need Afghan forces. In one sector Helmand province visited last week, Marines outnumbered Afghan soldiers 5 one. A Marine Company commander Helmand province told New York Times July lack Afghan troops "is absolutely Achilles heel." What need increase size Afghan army police? According Afghan Defense Minister Wardak, lack Afghan manpower; we've assured available. But need significantly trainers. We asked General Formica, charge American effort train Afghan security forces, whether increase possible. He indicated would make assessment would necessary order meet earlier timetable. In meantime, also press NATO allies much greater forcefulness provide trainers. If NATO allies going come combat forces pledged, least could provide additional trainers. Larger Afghan security forces also require mid-level Afghan officers. In addition supporting efforts graduate Afghan officers army academies, consider recommendation Defense Minister Wardak previous mid-level officers fought war Soviets return service interim basis. Minister Wardak emphasized men well qualified well motivated, may trained current tactics, nonetheless could temporarily meet need enlarged army new group officers trained. A larger Afghan force need supporting infrastructure, barracks. While available infrastructure may modern, adequate exists sufficient amounts. Larger Afghan security forces require additional equipment. There must major effort transfer significant amount equipment coming Iraq Afghan army police. Such significant commitment equip Afghan security forces would also help demonstrate U.S. determination take initiative create momentum right direction. There enormous amount equipment coming Iraq; military calling one greatest transfers military goods world's history. A significant part could transferred Afghan forces, increasing capability without weakening readiness. And yet seem kind crash effort place that. We need obtain urgent basis list basic equipment needs Afghan forces list needs could met major program transfer equipment leaving Iraq. Rapidly expanding Afghanistan's military police forces would address one major problems risks face there. General McChrystal told us worries waiting 2013 larger Afghan force creates gap capabilities brings significant risk failure. But accelerating training equipping Afghan forces year, address concern. Depending additional capability Afghan, rather U.S., forces, also addresses major problem public perception Afghanistan. The larger military footprint there, enemies seek drive wedge us Afghan population, spreading falsehood seek dominate Muslim nation. Finally, make concerted effort separate local Taliban leaders. In Iraq, large numbers young Iraqis attacking us switched side became "Sons Iraq." They drawn part promise jobs amnesty past attacks, part recognition status quo creating horrific violence communities. In interests interests nation, switched sides became positive force. That prospect exists Afghanistan. Afghan leaders military say local Taliban fighters motivated largely need job loyalty local leader pays ideology religious zeal. They believe effort attract fighters government's side could succeed, offered security families, penalty previous activity us. General McChrystal emphasized potential re-integration accomplish result achieved Iraq. Here General McChrystal said July 28th: "Most fighters see Afghanistan Afghans, foreign cadre them. But don't see deeply ideological even politically motivated; operating pay; commander's charismatic leadership; frustrated local leaders. So I believe significant potential go I would call mid- low-level Taliban fighters leaders offer re-integration Afghanistan constitution." But "game changing" possibility apparently factored General McChrystal's assessment. There plan yet put place Sons Iraq approach Afghanistan. It urgent lay steps need taken involve local national Afghan leaders effort. They alone accomplish crucial job, first Afghan allies must draft plan urgent basis. And potential positive impact plan taken account consider need additional U.S. military resources. Afghanistan's people grateful aid, also eager assume responsibility future. In tiny village Helmand Province, invited meet village elders council meeting, shura. One hundred men sat floor chatted us future country's future. When asked long United States stay, one elder said: "Until moment make security forces self-sufficient. Then welcome visit us, soldiers guests." Helping Afghanistan achieve self-sufficiency security everybody's goal. On little difference opinion, Afghanistan's village councils corridors Capitol. Can help Afghanistan reach self-sufficiency security fast enough? Can get way regains initiative creates momentum need? Can encourage lower level Taliban abandon insurgency headed terrorists whose fanaticism don't share? I believe can, supporting far rapid growth Afghan Army police; providing trainers quickly; rapid infusion Afghan units equipment longer needed Iraq; rapidly adopting plan re-integration lower level Taliban fighters Afghan society. In words, need surge Afghan security forces. Our support surge show commitment success mission clearly national security interest, without creating bigger U.S. military footprint provides propaganda fodder Taliban. I believe taking steps urgent basis, completing previously planned announced increase U.S. combat forces, provides best chance success mission: preventing Afghanistan run Taliban government harbors supports Al-Qaeda, whose goal inflict additional catastrophic attacks United States world. And implement steps considering increase U.S. ground combat forces beyond already planned end year.

Here's update, pieced together various sources: Starting around 3 pm Friday, Adams McGuinness returned Hillsborogh meet Robinson Arlene Foster. The four talked privately several hours asked draft papers review. The discussion continued around 1 parties left Hillsborough. (Foster's presence apparently helpful. Her relationship SF leaders much positive direct, treating equal colleagues.) Woodward Irish FM Martin meet Adams Robinson separately afternoon assess talks are. The talks last night/early morning ended positively still case may decision push today see agreement reached. It equally possible two ministers DUP/SF decide wind today resume Monday. Brown Cowen spoken morning speak late afternoon. The issue still parades. Robinson needs certainity change parades. It important politically within DUP, also externally since become symbol whether achieved something compromised much. Adams SF moved far original positions parades, adding Robinson also moved. The DUP linkage timeframes devolution parades Robinson's goal DUP deputy party leader Nigal Dodds. Logistically, linkage would impossible without delaying devolution given parades framework requires consultation, legislation, implementation. The role Justice Minister his/her relationship Executive agreed. Other issues, Irish language act, N-S bodies, etc, symbolic emotive SF nationalists community dealt with.

Philippe Jake asked send along response Washington Post editorial: By Michael Posner The Post's Dec. 27 editorial ("Redefining Human Rights") Obama Administration's human rights democracy policies, Secretary Clinton's recent speech Georgetown particular, misses critical point: human rights, democracy, development mutually reinforcing, competing goals. They complement task making human rights human reality. President Roosevelt understood fundamental link liberty, prosperity security, tying together freedom speech worship freedom want freedom fear famous "Four Freedoms" speech. At Georgetown, Secretary Clinton articulated 21st century vision grounded wisdom. To accuse Secretary Clinton embracing Soviet-bloc approach human rights includes development discussion democracy strains bonds credulity common sense, also walls crucial avenue ensuring people actually exercise rights naturally - including rights freedom religion, association, speech-in daily lives. As Secretary Clinton made clear, policies address development alone adequate: "Freedom doesn't come half measures, partial remedies solve whole problem," said. But experience shows us broad-based development occurs, people likely demand say securing futures, governments likely resources maintain strong institutions, including reliable police fair courts, help ensure consistent protection rights. Where people given right speak freely, participate nation's political process access basic information government, sustainable development likely occur. At time, democracies without development last. These mutually reinforcing tracks, Obama Administration committed pursuing simultaneously. As President Obama said Nobel lecture, "engagement repressive regimes lacks satisfying purity indignation." But Post's overheated outrage ignores lessons learned generations men women worked advance human rights around world. To suggest Secretary Clinton somehow provided excuses rights-abusing dictators speech forcefully criticized specific abuses across world, simply credible. Far excuse regime, approach pushes governments advance civil political rights ensure democracy actually delivers measure prosperity opportunity all. That right approach Obama Administration 21st century. ###

Madam Secretary, Jake mentioned would like see copy John Podesta's recent interview Financial Times. A transcript interview posted yet, I included Financial Times article interview. Please let know would like information this. Best, Mike Former aide urges Obama regain 'political narrative' By Edward Luce Washington Published: February 15 2010 Barack Obama, US president, lost control political narrative needs make use cabinet order regain it, says John Podesta, man headed president's transition team. "My friends White House would agree this, lost narrative," Mr Podesta said interview View DC, Financial Times' video series Washington. "Clearly needs one speech while: needs, I think, constantly reinforced. And president, entire team ... He's got terrific cabinet. Use it. Get country use it." Mr Podesta, also chief staff Bill Clinton, drew parallels former president's difficulties first two years, culminated 1994 Republican takeover Congress following failure healthcare reform. When asked whether failure latest attempt healthcare reform would result similar electoral "massacre" Democratic party mid-term elections November, said: "I subscribe view." Mr Podesta founded Centre American Progress, Washington's largest liberal think-tank, often described "government-in-exile" years George W. Bush White House. He said Mr Obama three options healthcare reform. First, try enact whole thing using budget reconciliation process, would enable pass 51 votes. The Democrats lost controlling 60-seat super-majority last month election defeat Massachusetts. The second would pass watered bill Republican support The third would abandon attempt, Mr Clinton 1993. Mr Podesta, Mr Obama still regularly consults, said still better 50:50 chance getting reform through. "The worst option among three nothing, they're going figure track viable," said. "It may mean Democratic votes. But such, it." He painted fairly bleak view overall health US politics. "It sucks," said. Pointing strategy obstructionism Republican lawmakers, said: "I think president trying re-engage Republicans, but, quite frankly, he's dealing party [Abraham] Lincoln. He's dealing party [Sarah] Palin." The growth partisanship increasing difficulty getting big reforms Senate threatening turn US into, "in essence, parliamentary system without majority rule", opposition automatically opposes serious initiatives.

See piece defamation religion. Not bad. http: I /www.economist.com/world/international/displavstorv.cfm?story id=15833005 Religion human rights The limits freedom faith Mar 31st 2010 From The Economist print edition Opponents bid Muslim states "protect religion" claim small success How dare call us blasphemers? IT DOES happen often: Christian lobbyists, sort favour prayer American classrooms crucifixes Italian ones, lining side secularists battle curb religion's role public square. But camps quiet satisfaction recent vote United Nations. Not outcome, slim margin defeat. On March 25th Human Rights Council (HRC), Geneva-based UN agency often exasperates Western members, voted 20 votes 17, eight abstentions, text lists "defamation religion" infringement liberty. Nothing amazing there: Organisation Islamic Conference (OIC), groups 56 mainly Muslim states (plus Palestine), working push resolutions kind General Assembly UN bodies since 2005. But margin smallest ever, opponents think could good chance defeating "defamation" motion next time one comes around. The OIC's idea establish principle faiths need protection, individuals do. It denies sinister intention (see article). And ears, OIC's effort sounds like harmless UN-speak, nothing more. (The United States Commission International Religious Freedom, congressionally mandated body, noted logical flaw: defamation means harming reputation living person entity: implies one can't defame idea religious founder longer, least physically, alive earth.) But critics OIC campaign, include atheists, Christians indeed Muslims, say "defamation" idea worse hot air: far protecting human rights, emboldens countries use blasphemy laws criminalise dissent. What encourages critics countries seem coming around view. Mexico, Uruguay, Argentina, Zambia South Korea voted latest resolution. Brazil criticised text abstained. Deeper still inside UN's bureaucracy, another battle religion rages—and stakes could even higher. An "ad hoc committee" mulling ways amend extend UN convention racial discrimination. Certain states want language would fuse categories race faith; want new convention, protocol existing one. For secularists (in broad sense people, including believers, oppose idea faith privileged access power), alarming. Non-binding resolutions defamation bad enough; UN treaty race-plus-religion would legal force, least signatories, give heart theocrats. At HRC's latest discussion effort March, Algerian oversees project keen plough ahead. But countries like Switzerland, Japan, Mexico, Argentina France retorted would better enforce existing UN norms dream new ones. Efforts widen racism accord resume, new chairman, late year—but critics relieved stalled it. Still, would-be theocrats may focus harder adding racism charter, face real risk defeated defamation, view Roy Brown, Geneva spokesman International Humanist Ethical Union. Meanwhile Christian-inspired NGO, European Centre Law Justice, denouncing abuse blasphemy laws many OIC member states. How fair point? It easy case make, example, Pakistan. Some 41 complaints blasphemy registered police Pakistan last year, says country's independent Human Rights Commission. In theory, blasphemy punishable death—a penalty handed never carried out. Worst-hit law minorities like Christians Ahmadis, group whose claim Muslim rejected Pakistani state. Although abuse law less rife 1980s, Islamist general tightened rules, law still invoked disputes (over property, say) nothing faith. "The vulnerable people, religious minorities, continue charged blasphemy," said Ali Dayan Hasan, researcher Human Rights Watch, campaign group. "But people convicted? No. Rarely. It used instrument political social coercion." When convictions occur, lead long jail terms; pre-trial detention last years. Pakistan's parliament revising constitution left intact religious bits, despite vow ruling party review blasphemy laws. (Indonesia stepped back move liberalise blasphemy regime.) On Pakistani streets, law dire effects. In January 2009, village Punjab province, five Ahmadis, labourer four children, charged blasphemy. They supposedly written "Prophet Muhammad" wall mosque toilet. The children behind bars nearly six months till charge quashed. And last September young Pakistani Christian accused throwing part Koran drain. It seems real crime, however, affection Muslim woman. A mob torched church, many Christians flee. He taken jail, died days later. His family alleged torture; authorities claimed suicide. There mayhem funeral country's Christians (see picture) appalled. In places, "defamation" faith threatens rights measures supposedly defend it.

Have seen story? I look forward discussing. Gates Says U.S. Lacks Strategy Curb Iran's Nuclear Drive By DAVID E. SANGER THOM SHANKER Published: April 18, 2010 WASHINGTON - Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates warned secret three-page memorandum top White House officials United States effective long-range policy dealing Iran's steady progress toward nuclear capability, according government officials familiar document. Several officials said highly classified analysis, written January President Obama's national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, touched intense effort inside Pentagon, White House intelligence agencies develop new options Mr. Obama. They include revised set military alternatives, still development, considered diplomacy sanctions fail force Iran change course. Officials familiar memo's contents would describe portions dealing strategy policy, sections apparently dealt secret operations Iran, deal Persian Gulf allies. One senior official, like others spoke condition anonymity sensitive nature memo, described document "a wake-up call." But White House officials dispute view, insisting 15 months conducting detailed planning many possible outcomes regarding Iran's nuclear program. In interview Friday, General Jones declined speak memorandum. But said: "On Iran, said going do. The fact don't announce publicly entire strategy world see doesn't mean don't strategy anticipates full range contingencies - do." But memo, Mr. Gates wrote variety concerns, including absence effective strategy Iran choose course many government outside analysts consider likely: Iran could assemble major parts needs nuclear weapon - fuel, designs detonators - stop short assembling fully operational weapon. In case, Iran could remain signatory Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty becoming strategists call "virtual" nuclear weapons state. According several officials, memorandum also calls new thinking United States might contain Iran's power decided produce weapon, deal possibility fuel weapons could obtained one terrorist groups Iran supported, officials said considered less-likely possibility. Mr. Gates never mentioned memo public. His spokesman, Geoff Morrell, declined comment specifics document, issued statement Saturday saying, "The secretary believes president national security team spent extraordinary amount time effort considering preparing full range contingencies respect Iran." Pressed administration's ambiguous phrases close United States willing allow. Iran's program proceed, senior administration official described last week somewhat clearer terms line Iran would permitted cross. The official said United States would ensure Iran would "acquire nuclear capability," step Tehran could get well developed sophisticated weapon. "That includes ability breakout," said, using term nuclear specialists apply country suddenly renounces nonproliferation treaty uses technology build small arsenal. Nearly two weeks ago, Mr. Obama, interview The New York Times, asked whether saw difference nuclear-capable Iran one fully developed weapon. "I'm going parse right now," said. But noted North Korea considered nuclear-capable state threw inspectors and, said, "became self-professed nuclear state." Mr. Gates alluded concern intelligence agencies might miss signals Iran taking final steps toward producing weapon. Last Sunday NBC News program "Meet Press," said: "If policy go threshold assemble nuclear weapon, tell assembled? I don't actually know would verify that." But cautioned Iran run production difficulties, said, "It's going slow - slower anticipated, moving direction." Mr. Gates taken crucial role formulating administration's strategy, known career issue stark warnings possibility strategic surprise. Some officials said memo viewed light: warning relatively new president United States adequately prepared. He wrote memo Iran let pass 2009 deadline set Mr. Obama respond offers diplomatic engagement. Both process efforts bring new sanctions Iran struggled. Administration officials hoped revelation Mr. Obama September Iran building new uranium enrichment plant inside mountain near Qum would galvanize nations Iran, reaction muted. The next three months spent proved fruitless diplomatic talks Iran plan swap much low-enriched uranium fuel medical reactor Tehran. By time Mr. Gates wrote memo, negotiations collapsed. Mr. Gates's memo appears reflect concerns upper echelons Pentagon military White House well-prepared series alternatives place case diplomatic steps finally failed. In fact, Mr. Gates issued warning, chairman Joint Chiefs Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, wrote official "chairman's guidance" staff saying military option would "limited results" Iran's nuclear facilities, preparations needed stepped up. "Should president call military options, must ready," admiral wrote. Administration officials testifying Senate committee last week made clear preparations way. So General Jones. "The president made clear beginning administration need prepared every possible contingency," said interview. "That done day one, successfully building coalition nations isolate Iran pressure live obligations." At hearing Senate Armed Services Committee, Lt. Gen. Ronald L. Burgess Jr., director Defense Intelligence Agency, Gen. James E. Cartwright, vice chairman Joint Chiefs Staff one military's experienced officers nuclear matters, said Iran could produce bomb-grade fuel least one nuclear weapon within year, would probably need two five years manufacture workable atomic bomb. The administration stepping efforts contain influence Iran counter missiles, including placing Patriot anti-missile batteries, mostly

Conference By JONATHAN WEISMAN, JAY SOLOMON JOE LAURIA The U.S. negotiating Egypt proposal make Middle East region free nuclear weapons, U.S. seeks prevent Iran derailing monthlong U.N. conference nuclear nonproliferation begins Monday. U.S. officials familiar move call important step assuring countries Washington—criticized silence Israel's undeclared nuclear arsenal—will equitably address weapons proliferation across region, Iran seeks shift focus away nuclear program. Washington also reassured Israel won't foist nuclear-free zone region parties agree significant progress made Mideast peace. The U.N. conference Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, held every five years, expected begin bang Monday address Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, condemned West refusal disarm tacitly accepting Israel's nuclear capability. Secretary State Hillary Clinton follow Iranian leader afternoon. The U.N. talks come time Iran believed heading toward nuclear capability U.S. allies pressing new, tough Security Council sanctions curb Tehran's program. "The Iranians clearly intending spoil party," said senior U.S. official involved nuclear diplomacy. The official highlighted importance raising Mideast nuclear-free zone issues. The designation region zone free weapons mass destruction nonbinding agreement emerged 1995 U.N. review Non-Proliferation Treaty, 1970 pact limit spread nuclear weapons. That 1995 agreement pivotal won indefinite extension treaty, action zone taken since. Senior Obama administration officials said Friday White House willing significantly advance Mideast nuclear weapons-free zone, would support conference subject future date. U.S. officials said talks Egypt would resume New York coming month. Such zone envisaged include Israel, Arab states, Iran Turkey. "We've made proposal [Egypt] goes beyond U.S. willing before," said senior U.S. official involved nuclear diplomacy. U.S. officials stressed, however, didn't believe would happen without first achieving major advances Arab-Israeli peace talks. "We concerned conditions right unless members region participate, would unlikely unless comprehensive peace plan accepted," said Ellen Tauscher, undersecretary state arms control international security. She said U.S. also discussed zone Arab League members Nonaligned Movement. The diplomacy could raise new tensions President Barack Obama Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Washington seen backing away commitment Israel. Israel voiced concerns U.N. conference could turn international forum corner Israel. Mr. Netanyahu backed nuclear-security conference Washington March due concerns.

The U.S. Israel locked monthslong spat Mr. Obama's calls complete freeze building new Jewish housing West Bank East Jerusalem. U.S. officials grown increasingly confident recent days ties U.S. Israel stabilized. Mrs. Clinton said Friday Mideast peace process get track next week, though U.S.-brokered direct talks involving Israeli Palestinians Obama administration wants see. Egypt's latest proposal calls Israel's disarmament "as soon possible." It also called Israel's nuclear program placed auspices International Atomic Energy Agency, U.N.'s atomic watchdog. That proposal won't accepted, U.S. officials said. The Egyptian working paper demands NPT signatory states release "all information available nature scope Israeli nuclear facilities activities, including information pertaining previous nuclear transfers Israel." U.S. officials indicated demands could made Israel. Arms-control analysts familiar talks say U.S. likely propose creating U.N. envoy given task calling conference Middle East nations press forward nuclear weapon-free zone. "They desperate buy Egyptian objections," said Henry Sokolski, executive director Non-Proliferation Education Center critic Obama administration's arms-control approach. Daryl Kimball, executive director Arms Control Association, advocacy group, said U.S. acceptance special envoy significant shift. A U.S. official refused say whether envoy proposal, first floated Russia, part U.S. offer. The last NPT conference 2005 ended collapse.

This political officer London: David Cameron given right reply PM's statement afternoon -- followed Q&A. UUP MP Sylvia Hermon likely "unhelpful" Q&A.

Just saw email Sid - working report. Shaun apparently much pessimistic view Cameron would Parliament watchers, felt confident get-go would support deal. PM Brown praised parties involved; stressed need adhere dates laid agreement several times; welcomed supportive Westminster interventions Q A SDLP Mark Durkan DUP Peter Robinson Nigel Dods, pointedly expressed hope parties (read UUP, whose MP either present simply didn't speak) would express support soon possible. As expected, David Cameron praised agreement parties; raised desire parties (read SDLP UUP) given time review document; pointedly asked PM issues expressly mentioned agreement would addressed Working Group -- Brown responded, "all issues outstanding St Andrew's." Cameron Brown praised U.S. role, singling out. Brown also twice referred offer host investment conference. Overall, nothing concerning Tories...on contrary, full support, request minority parties chance review questions outstanding issues. UUP MLAs meet tonight review. Note: DUP interventions balanced.. .Dods raised parades decommissioning reminder outstanding issues, stressed desire parties "not go back" bad old days. Minor dig previous Sinn Fein "threats." Robinson stressed cooperation negotiations. Struck statesmanlike tone.

The Central Election Commission complete vote tabulation today must certify results within ten days; certification expected early Friday. Tymoshenko, silent publicly, plans bring cases alleged electoral fraud courts, change result. Tymoshenko claims intends work within law incite street protests. Our recommendation EU Ambassadors Kiev recommended approach Brussels, want revisit progress Friday. Medvedev called Yanukovych today praise conduct elections, stopped short congratulating victory. Following certification election, Tymoshenko likely appeal within legal five-day period. This likely push back inauguration date early March.

Our clips service doesn't license necessary provide FT (or Reuters) content, here's long awaited FT profile -you'll especially interested guest column David Milliband wrote: An FT interview Hillary Clinton By Daniel Dombey FT June 11 2010 22:21 This like Hillary Clinton. The motorcade, twisting skidding rain-splashed streets hour; public meetings camera lights journey's end; spotlight let two decades. It almost 2008 US presidential election - hailed exciting generation - never ended. But campaign without vote. Today, Clinton's convoy snaking Sao Paulo, Brazil, South Hampton, New Hampshire. She longer aspirant White House, despite overnight flights, town hall meetings strategy sessions make gruelling schedule might suggest. Instead, Latin America shore relations region promote new idea US leadership, one much built around herself. She's bigger ecstatic audiences 700-odd students staff crammed hall tonight Zumbi dos Pradares, Afro-Brazilian university, she's still greeted wave raised arms audience snaps away mobile phones. In convoy moments before, wrapped shawl, suffering cold angry delays pushed us side streets speckled box-like bars, warehouses love hotels Brazilian motorists sought cut path. There sign now. With metabolism born politician, feeds energy audience takes questions students, teachers local celebrities hour. Hillary Clinton never looks happier centre stage. Most US secretaries state wouldn't bother sort event, much less initiate arrange screened biggest local channel. Yet Clinton almost every foreign trip - seems spend half life official 727, crammed long-time aides armed bodyguards. The schedule backbreaking constantly shifting. She notched quarter million miles since taking office. On Latin America trip, thrown confusion earthquake Chile, already visited four countries 24 hours. We go tiny Uruguay, stay brief check hotel shower; Argentina, spend almost time presidential palace; Chile itself, don't leave airport; Brazil, spend almost full day. So exactly Clinton trying never-ending world tour? Travelling week, talking people inside outside administration, I tried find out. "We case make case made president prime minister foreign minister ambassador," tells weeks later, perches sofa expansive office, view Lincoln Memorial. "People voice opinion vote many instances direction societies take ... I want model different kind leadership open willing listen [also] stand ground necessary." She argues trips help restore US's image wake Bush administration - making contact public opinion abroad, boosting American power. Her aides say that, battle-hardened politician also happens one famous women world, ideally placed carry task. But deeper question whether merely implementing foreign policy crafted Barack Obama, boss former rival, whether role - ambitions - go beyond that. Is kind saleswoman-in-chief US, I ask? "Well, I think part job," replies, toying napkin underneath glass water. "If making case American values American leadership, make people get information ... Given bridges build repair work do, travel." As S'ao Paulo, system strain - "I've fighting day," says masks cough set allergies (Washington's cherry blossom trees shedding flowers). Life still hectic - volcanic ash cloud paralysed Europe televisions throughout State Department showing first British election debate. But Clinton remains enthusiastic, affable unhurried, speech peppered exclamations "oh gosh", even discusses issues state. She politely asks I updates Europe's airspace shutdown tells she's talking Norway's foreign minister it. "He said dust gets engines size, even Air Force One - it's chunky! I don't know else describe it," says, odd note hilarity entering voice pronounces word "chunky". Clinton often speaks eager, unvarnished way - world away clipped, on-message manner immediate predecessor post, Condoleezza Rice. If anything, undiplomat - known less calibrated circumlocutions plain speaking sometimes gaffes, woman retains formidable political constituency laugh admitted send cats scurrying room. Her staff point third elected politician 60 years served secretary state, first come outside foreign policy establishment since James Baker, George H.W. Bush's right-hand man perhaps illustrious recent predecessor. She may substantive politician office since William Jennings Bryan, three-time presidential candidate served secretary almost century ago. "Her stature world stage, almost presidential stature, set apart," Bill Burns, top career diplomat State Department, tells me. "Leaders want meet her. And town hall meetings make difference public opinion." State visitor Hillary Clinton greeted Air Force Base Commander Colonel Celso de Araujo S'ao Paulo airport March Back Sao Paulo, meeting university ranges far confines dramatis personae traditional diplomacy. Annie, young woman red blue dreadlocked hair, tells Clinton dance percussion classes asks study US without paying college fees. A nervous young man confesses lost halfway abstruse question tariff policy; Clinton, smiling nodding vaguely automatic way hers, bears same. Another female student asks autograph. When answering, Clinton sometimes opens eyes wide emphasises phrase; moments, seemingly random, pulls hands apart demonstrating size fish. Then law student called Marina asks abortion - illegal Brazil - Clinton moves treacherous terrain. She speaks Brazilian hospital visited 1990s treated expectant mothers women suffering consequences backstreet abortions. "Wealthy women rights every country," says. "And poor women don't." Her strength feeling can't hidden denounces "the great toll illegal abortions take denial women able exercise fundamental personal right". Tom Shannon, US ambassador Brazil, tells later: "I understand possible concern might come close domestic issues. But wasn't laying prescription Brazil. She sharing experience woman American politics secretary state." It's true: Clinton doesn't quite cross line. Onstage, controlled without seeming artificial, convivial without appearing over-effusive, previous age would call real trouper. At podium looks straight ahead, lips carefully expressionless. Still, old competitive instincts haven't left her. Perhaps lecterns press conferences, reminiscent Democratic presidential debates, exiting podium joint appearance Argentina's president Cristina Fernandez, Clinton makes clear satisfaction last word. The expert debater usually bested Obama left stage. Yet competitive urge coexists one insider describes "almost inhuman loyalty" towards Obama. Her mastery facts - "information carnivore" one officials calls - comes despite consensus much Washington role consists largely implementing foreign policy Obama inner circle framed, rather helping frame herself. In Sao Paulo, shows loyalty striking fashion asked repeatedly positive discrimination - another sensitive topic Brazil - least because, Clinton observes, Afro- Brazilians account half country's population 2 per cent university students. "That suggests special steps need taken [in] recruiting admitting students chance succeed," tells hall, inching towards domestic politics, speaking pride progress US civil rights movement made past half-century. She says: "The election Barack Obama, many believe, greatest accomplishment demonstrated African-American could elected president United States." Among crowd, I catch breath scribble words. It's hard think fulsome statement woman fought hard Obama - squandered huge poll lead millions dollars struggle him. The great collaborator Clinton established strong working relationships within Obama administration When I ask Clinton later managed move antagonism primary race obedience office, dismisses question anodyne "that's politics". She adds: "We're working really hard well together ... It never comes more, seems like ancient history me." Not ancient, I think, willing admit failings campaign. "I always run inclusive successful organisations," retorts I ask whether she'd applied lessons searing experience new post. She admits didn't want job State - says exhausted election missed Senate -. "but end day, I'm pretty old-fashioned president asks something, you'd better really good reason can't." Also, adds: "Suppose I won I asking cabinet ... I would wanted say yes." Others say relationship complex, dint loyalty unflagging hard work, Clinton moved closer charmed circle made even formidable political force before. "Quite simply, gives good advice president year half recognised that," says Anne-Marie Slaughter, head State Department policy planning unit. "The relationship based performance job." By accounts, it's collaborative partnership, though perhaps warm one. Clinton boasts good working relationship main players administration - formed something alliance defence secretary Robert Gates, although life-and-death issues Afghanistan, Gates, her, taken lead. As one official told me, secretaries state often either popular department - Colin Powell comes mind - rest administration - Condoleezza Rice - Clinton managed both. In truth, Clinton's language remains harder-edged Obama's - recently claimed Iran's Revolutionary Guard staged slow-motion coup - sometimes willing hint using military. "She seems step bit spine right time," says Kurt Volker, US ambassador Nato George W. Bush. She also assumed ever prominent role talking leaders Benjamin Netanyahu Israel Hamid Karzai Afghanistan - apparently trusted Obama. Meanwhile, careful keep husband, former US president, background. Aides say barely seen building - though Clinton says behind scenes Bill Clinton gives strategic advice. "One favourite sayings, I remind time, kind baseball saying," says: "Don't major minors; keep eye headlines trend lines." It co-operative stance rather notable effort set grand vision chief theme time far State. When I ask Clinton name proudest achievement office, replies "the effective collaborative approach administration taken towards identifying solving problems." A process-oriented, less provocative answer would hard imagine. But maybe, I think, US less scope grand strategy past couple decades, country seemed bestride world colossus-style. Clinton suggests formidable tasks confronting US administration little scope enter internecine fights needs instead focus challenges hand. Whatever reason stance, seems smart decision - accounts she's overcome many suspicions White House retinue towards her. "It's fair say born administration's inner circle slowly surely, consequential decisions, prime seat table," says one official. Praising calls "Terminator-quality durability determination," adds: "She's done amazing amount work, judging way build strategic vision bottom up, mastering details." Indeed, Clinton's ability master arcane foreign policy briefs marvel building. She dropped obscure working groups shown unnerving knowledge details. At confirmation hearings last year exchanged facts arctic Alaskan senator; meeting So Paulo becomes enthused freight transport policy Brazil US. She acknowledges finding feet foreign policy something struggle, despite campaign claims expertise field. "It intellectually challenging, get arms around issues," says. During first year, criticised apparent gaffes - including way called Israel halt building settlements occupied territory hail partial freeze months later unprecedented. On election campaign, says, "you may different city four times day message you're trying deliver repetitive aimed audience. But might deal 10 different countries' problems, six different regional global challenges course day." As Latin America tour shows, trying - travel incessantly solve array international issues. She forefront US's efforts consolidate relations number important countries - predominantly Russia China, also rising powers Brazil, Turkey, Indonesia South Africa - cool anti-American feeling hotspots, notably Pakistan. She says push working, hailing "change public opinion places pretty negative US" - reference Russia Pakistan. But far smooth sailing. Differences Iran Israel's raid aid-bearing ships Gaza stoked tensions Turkey Brazil recently, amid questioning effectiveness Obama administration's policies. During time road, stop Brazil focal point - surprising given country's increased profile Latin America leader. Clinton heading administration's push secure sanctions Iran, Brasilia tries fails win President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva cause. She employs almost combative tone press conference Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign minister. At moments appears barely contain irritation, denounces "an Iran runs Brazil" well countries Turkey China "telling different things different people avoid international sanctions". Amorim spiky way - drawing parallels 1990s sanctions Iraq claims weapons mass destruction 2003 war. "Of course, I don't agree everything Secretary said," says. It happy experience - indeed past week Brazil Turkey voted sanctions United Nations - yet Hillary Clinton nowhere near giving up. Years ago, one Bill Clinton's biographers described approach government "permanent campaign", appears wife's preferred form existence well. If one constant Clinton's life, never throws cards, whether motivates power public service. "Never, never!" exclaims, I ask whether ever thought walking wings frustrations indignities time White House. "I realistic sense high- stakes politics requires took get it's shocking arena ... figure out, take seriously purposes analysis understanding, can't take personally." Such treatment seems rankle same. She's listening coverage ahead British debate plainly irritated coverage leaders' wives. "Whether woman's running office she's supporting husband who's running office gets criticised wearing open-toed shoes colour coat, there's lot history bear woman puts political arena," says. Another country Clinton boards official 727 fly Sao Paulo Costa Rica Injustice towards women appears issue enthuses Clinton job - many incarnations American public life, whether First Lady before. "I feel passionately American national security interests world's, women given opportunities tools make lives," says. In 1990s steered clear reading newspapers way treated. Today, says, "I certainly don't read coverage me, I read else going I need know job." "It's baloney," says Philippe Reines, press adviser, set meeting sitting one side office. "Yeah, yeah, right, that's tells me," Clinton responds. I wonder. She may read stories her, boosted domestic profile still talking American magazines Esquire, Vogue Parade. To end? Clinton said serve one four-year term secretary state - understandable, given grind job. When I ask whether expects woman president next decade so, responds: "I'd love that, obviously I would love that. I want front centre happens." "Any chance would you?" I ask. "No, no, I don't think that's cards," Clinton says. She's given categoric denials past. "I think there's whole generation young women young, mature, seasoned women earning stripes recognising tough there. It faint heart run president, I believe harder women, is, that's fact." But, says one US official, "all profiles media treatment undercut argument finished electoral politics. Why stuff? She's already Hillary Clinton. You ask: 'What's idea behind raising domestic profile still further?" Indeed now, counts, popular politician America Washington say could good fit vice-presidential slot 2012 elections. Back Sao Paulo, town hall meeting over, Clinton faces seven-hour flight Costa Rica. The journey goes on, saleswoman-in-chief US unruly world, faces long, hard road. Today US sometimes struggles assert world stage. But obstacles rather fewer product pitching herself. A secretary state like none her, Hillary Clinton, long one formidable figures US politics, looking stronger ever. Daniel Dombey FT's US diplomatic correspondent David Miliband: "Hillary rock star ... great sense fun, great sense humour" It's early start chalking scorecard Hillary Clinton, Obama administration, laying foundations long-term change America's foreign policy. The challenges immense - probably difficult inheritance previous administration. But American leadership essential commitment multilateralism - fact multi, multilateralism using different overlapping forums - real right. You also remember Hillary rock star. When I arrived Nato Foreign Ministers meeting March 2009, nice surprise staff, never mind press, seemed turned droves arrival. Then I realised Hillary 10 minutes behind me. That said, thing surprised working Clinton intelligence hard work, well known, behind serious exterior someone great sense fun, great sense humour. She seen politics sides, laugh well others. She's remarkably good listener, always synthesising ideas opinions develop own. She thinks strategically well tactically. She's also very, unpompous. Hillary political person particular way, honours politics public service believes democratic politics necessary evil, calling value vocation. She knows win lose some, it's essential take part. There's one thing. Hillary people person thinks deeply psychology people she's dealing with. Their motivation, loyalties, culture. It's real emotional intelligence trying understand people disagree get agree. I think must many members administration say good colleague. David Miliband shadow foreign secretary Gideon Rachman: "Relations White House State Department particularly close" A school teacher asked write report Hillary Clinton's stint secretary state would give 10/10 effort rather modest mark actual achievements - maybe six seven. Secretaries state generally judged two criteria. First, done endless bureaucratic turf wars characterise Washington politics? Second, effective promoting US foreign policy wider world? Success one area usually helps other. Henry Kissinger superb Washington infighter - close relationship President Nixon made effective overseas. Colin Powell, George W. Bush's first secretary state, widely admired outside US - came wrong side many Washington battles, limited ability get things done wider world. Hillary Clinton skilfully avoided sucked debilitating Washington struggles damaged Powell. Despite often poisonous rivalry Obama Clinton camps campaign, Clinton good working relationship president. But relations White House State Department cordial, seem particularly close. Clinton appointed many loyalists campaign State Department, result State rather detached Obama's inner circle. Obama's penchant making high-profile speeches foreign capitals Cairo, Prague, Tokyo Istanbul means president done anyone else define administration's approach world. That still leaves role Clinton fill crucial details policy. But special representatives appointed deal Afghanistan Middle East - Treasury critical China policy. Asked Clinton's impact secretary state, one senior European policymaker purses lips says: "She's done great trips, she's highly professional. But it's hard see particular area really driven policy." Gideon Rachman FT's chief foreign affairs columnist David Rothkopf: "When asked deliver tough messages, done unflinchingly" Hillary Clinton cautious secretary state: protected president well pursued agenda without upstaging - early concern, given stature. She worked well members cabinet, reconsidering role structure State Department. That includes review role diplomacy going forward. Clinton acknowledged rise new powers changing global power structure taken steps reshape US foreign policy structure accordingly. An important part recognising importance co-operating private non-state actors NG0s, well dealing non-state threats. When administration called upon deliver tough messages, done unflinchingly. This allowed president articulate strategic vision Clinton goes implementing. Still, neither secretary state president determines global situation. The US may powerful country world one among many powerful countries, many aspects situation face today beyond control. The Obama administration dealt extremely difficult hand: Iraq Afghanistan, Iran North Korea's nuclear programmes, rise emerging powers complex still unfolding series financial crises. We gone world US thought limitless resources unbounded options one limits clear; world could work GB one work context G20; world new technologies new powers play bigger role. All things would dictate change foreign policy regardless office. Hillary Clinton established solid foundation. The next step identify couple signature issues - couple signature successes. That take next level. David Rothkopf visiting scholar Carnegie Endowment International Peace expertise national security

Aides U.S. general Afghanistan slam Obama: report 20 mins ago WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Aides top U.S. general Afghanistan insulted President Barack Obama's closest advisers, calling one "clown" another "wounded animal," article published Friday Rolling Stone magazine. The article also quotes aide describing commander U.S. NATO forces Afghanistan General Stanley McChrystal's "disappointment" initial one-on-one meeting Obama last year.

McChrystal, famous workaholic said sleep four hours day, brought Afghanistan year ago predecessor pushed out. The article portrays teams disapproving Obama administration, exception Secretary State Hillary Clinton, backed McCrystal's request additional troops Afghanistan. Some strongest criticism reserved Richard Holbrooke, Obama's special envoy Afghanistan Pakistan. "The boss says he's like wounded animal," member general's team quoted saying. "Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors he's going get fired, makes dangerous." McChrystal quoted saying felt "betrayed" leak classified cable U.S. Ambassador Afghanistan Karl Eikenberry last year. The cable raised doubts sending troops shore Afghan government already lacking credibility.

"I like Karl, I've known years, they'd never said anything like us before," McChrystal quoted saying. "Here's one covers flank history books. Now fail, say, 'I told so."

RELEASE IN PART B5
Mitchell meets BN tomorrow Jerusalem, Abbas Saturday, BN Saturday, Cairo Mubarak Sunday. They take call down.
Wants talk re Afghanistan displeasure Holbrooke. They got verbal sparring match hearing. I thought holbrooke polite responsive.
And pasted exchange Corker Holbrooke: CORKER: Mr. Chairman, thank you. I want thank ambassador coming. I know wealth knowledge certainly served country many years. A number us wrote letter asking hearing, guess might hearings way. But reason wrote letter -- bipartisan letter -- provide Congress American people definition end state civilian operations Afghanistan, clear objectives civilian mission, detailed plan achieving objectives, specific, measurable metrics used measure progress towards achieving objectives. I say, I've hour 10 minutes. I heard nothing -- nothing -- that. And I respect ambassador, I've heard lot process. I've heard lot meetings. I earthly idea -- earthly idea objectives civilian front. And I don't know time begin right now, far incredible waste time, standpoint -- hearing, though. And I tremendous respect you, maybe wrong witness. I hope we'll maybe Secretary Clinton Eikenberry, maybe Crocker. I know he's supposed come. But could answer question purpose hearings first place? HOLBROOKE: I'm sorry. You don't feel I've told civilian programs are? CORKER: You've told lot process. I'd like know definition end state civilian operations, question asked set hearing up, Afghanistan, clear objectives -- -- detailed plan achieving those. I'd like hear talk that. I mean, I'm glad lot interagency folks here, I'm hearing anything talks we're going. I'd also like know withdrawal date that's set affects affects we're working country. HOLBROOKE: First all, Senator Corker, I believe I discussed civilian programs considerable detail within constraints time, prepare report committee earlier year, entered record I happy enter record again, wish. And go every one programs. The reason I brought colleagues show whole-of-government, unprecedented effort. Now, specifics, since want specifics, Afghanistan agricultural country. It exported agricultural products 1978 Soviet invasion. We trying rebuild it. This done first seven years war. We -- -- committee given us great deal money agriculture. And spending wisely joint AID- USDA effort, Senator Lugar particularly involved in, food, seeds, cash-for-work programs, encouraging alternatives opium production. HOLBROOKE: Secondly, rule law. We spending -- spending money authorized us create justice system cut Taliban's propaganda corruption lack justice system. Third, counter-narcotics. We ended poppy eradication, radical change, eradicating poppy seeds, poppy crops, driving farmers, poor farmers, hands Taliban. Fourth, major program subnational governance, putting aid directly district level. Fifth, major effort specific areas, alluded earlier, electricity Kandahar. Senator Kerry asked earlier Kandahar. One major issues bring electricity people benefit international presence. The whole range activities designed support country support General Petraeus' counter- insurgency effort. He I -- I counterpart two weeks ago moved Kabul. We worked intimately effort create joint civilian-military effort. And I happy provide every detail wish private briefings behalf team. Point number two regard end state issue raised. I want clear difference end state exit strategy. If -- personal view, senator -- walk away Afghanistan, again, 21 years ago, consequences similarly catastrophic, unique strategic position Afghanistan reaction would Pakistan, China, India country Afghanistan's west, Iran, well larger region includes Russia, Saudi Arabia, India, even extending Western Europe, concerned terrorism region, much are. So, I hope talk end state, talk sustainable end state involves continued American economic development assistance, continue fulfill obligations train police military. This cheap. But fraction money authorized appropriated military campaign. When able transition impossible anyone say. But won't single day. It gradual process. And review December president's decision-making focus on. CORKER: In foreign policy, generally speaking -- I know we've rough times last several years -- it's something we've able address bipartisan way. And I think issues you're dealing with, we're dealing Afghanistan incredibly tough. I still don't -- I haven't understood administration saying beginning. That's critical them. I don't understand. I still don't understand. I've met staff State Department. It's incredibly vague me. And I think doing, partners, include Pakistanis everybody around, don't know we're doing. They don't know we're leaving. They think we're leaving shortly, I think. We've colleagues come there. We've -- we've got president that's play sides, wants survive, doesn't know intentions are. The Pakistanis don't know intentions are, I don't think. And they're making accommodations sides. So, I tell you, I send letters parents spouses. And I feel lack clarity Afghanistan, we're Afghanistan, don't successful. And don't leave, things outlined. But I don't hear clarity. And again, I want support administration. I want support you, that's need country, let shores (ph) align (ph), let partisanship. But I tell you, person wants that, I still don't understand. OK? And I average intelligence, I would ask to, please -- maybe let's witnesses shed light specific. But I don't understand, I'm concerned. And I think we're sending lot mixed signals. And I think there's lot dissension. Actually, I listen you, even within administration itself, end. And I ask you, please. You lot experience, help us understand. You haven't done today. And I would ask chairman please witnesses come explain us end state is, envision Afghanistan whenever withdrawal take place, I still understand. We've changed it. Now it's sort degraded country conflict, it's control. I mean, bar continues change. And I'm concerned individual, yet I want us be, can, page much possible. But I think that, got much clearer outlined. HOLBROOKE: Senator, I'm sorry answers don't fully satisfy you. But I want clear this, I understand comments I respect them. First all, core question -- one asked constituents, I'm asked everybody -- Afghanistan? The short, simple answer 9/11, direct threats national security interests, fact enemies homeland Pakistani side border, single struggle. And strengthen Afghan government let -- teach stand feet time, move forward, things fall outside scope hearing, dismantle, deter defeat Al Qaida. Now, believe it's threat homeland, honest difference opinion. But I think Times Square bombing incident shows clearly dangerous situation is. Secondly, civilian mission, again, it's support single, civilian-military, counter-insurgency mission. And benchmarks, requested required Congress, submitted you. And overarching goal always same, disrupt, dismantle defeat Al Qaida prevent ability threaten United States. And believe, us -- division executive branch -- situation face direct threat. We believe Times Square situation occurred, I don't think anything could proved vividly. And achieve this, degrade Taliban well, part enemy's structure -- different part, integral part -- face. Now, Afghan government doesn't yet capacity deal own. How could 30 years war? And so, civilian part it, things I've mentioned -- police, government capacity, rule law, subnational government, training provincial officials, women's empowerment whole series major issues -- part civilian programs. And we're happy come back office -- appreciated visit us -- continue dialogue. Our civilian strategy designed keeping Al Qaida bay, it's designed help Afghan institutions establish conditions stable governance. Our plan benchmarks, briefed colleagues, we're happy discuss detail time.
He calling complain Ambassador Holbrooke. He feels Holbrooke condescending forthcoming, including week's hearing. He also broader concerns lack clear end state metrics Afghan policy, main reason wants talk Holbrooke. Holbrooke tried faithfully answer questions frankly Corker looking sound byte got one. We offer additional briefings readout upcoming trip would help. You could use also opportunity thank sitting earlier week New START Treaty; note received following July 14 follow-up letter; want continue working get place support treaty.

I plane 630 til 1245 eastern easily reachable thereafter. I recommend
HRC: Below oped National Security Strategy I wrote tomorrow's Outlook. Unfortunately, give horrible title, I think piece turned alright. Best, Sandy By Samuel R. Berger Samuel R. Berger, chair global strategy firm Albright Stonebridge Group, served national security advisor President Clinton 1997 2001. President Obama's National Security Strategy, released White House Thursday, tackles delicate unavoidable question: How respond new old security challenges era financial distress home reordering political power abroad? For time now, clear definition U.S. national security strategy needs rethinking. The September 11 attacks, global economic crisis, cyber-terror threats even environmental catastrophe Gulf underscore challenges America faces 2010 changed even decade ago. And America's military supremacy certainly risk, new international arrangements - shift G-7 club powerful nations G-20, incorporates emerging nations China Brazil - needed costs benefits stable international order shared. The United States cannot solve global threats without others, bear burden alone. Enter National Security Strategy. In experience, congressionally mandated documents easily become laborious impenetrable, mere compendiums bureaucratic pleading various parts government. (Make sure right Japan! Don't step Pentagon!) The challenge, President Clinton insisted upon advisers, provide strategic framework clarifying rest world informs administration decision makers line. It's blueprint action, means convey president's principles priorities. In Obama's case, new sober comprehensive 52-page strategy incorporates new realities breaks past strategies several key respects. But also reflects understanding face enduring challenges - nuclear proliferation, terrorism regional conflicts - best response return fundamentals. One fundamental strength economy. At time after-effects financial crisis fiscal burden two long wars raised fears overextended America, administration makes case economic technological renewal crucial underpinning U.S. security. The president made case West Point speech last weekend. "At time human history," said, "has nation diminished economic vitality maintained military political primacy." Another fundamental challenge arms control nuclear proliferation. By seeking strategic arms cuts Russia, president returned long bipartisan tradition languished prior administration. And convening global summit securing nuclear material spring, Obama given new urgency global purchase effort started 1991 Sens. Sam Nunn Richard Lugar first initiated program lock nuclear materials. On terrorism, strategy builds past, breaks well. Presidents Clinton, Bush Obama deployed America's tools: military power, homeland defense, law enforcement, sanctions, intelligence vigorous efforts cut terrorist financing. But critical difference Obama strategy rejects Global War Terror lens prior administration viewed challenge. "This global war tactic - terrorism - religion - Islam," new strategy says. "We war specific network, al-Qaeda terrorist affiliates." This sharper focus avoids alienating many Muslim world, ensures support key allies never accepted broader construct avoids overreactions led us forsake fight al-Qaeda fight Afghanistan turn efforts unrelated threat Saddam Hussein's Iraq. In perhaps dramatic departure strategy predecessor, Obama administration restored less provocative policy use military force. In 2002 national security strategy, President Bush articulated rationale preemptive war weeks seeking U.N. resolution invade Iraq. The new strategy restores principles guided administrations decades: use force last resort, weigh costs benefits, much international support possible. The administration reserves right act unilaterally - example al-Qaeda allies - resurrects principle President Clinton often described "together possible, alone necessary." President Obama's critics focused diplomatic engagement hostile states like Iran North Korea. The President sets forth rationale: "to create opportunities resolve differences, strengthen international community's support actions, learn intentions nature closed regimes, plainly demonstrate public within nations governments blame isolation." In case Iran, Washington's outstretched hand resulted Iran's compliance. But attempts engage helped ensure world's attention focused Iran's intransigence rather Washington's refusal negotiate. Without doubt, gaps principle practice. Despite Obama administration's stated goal doubling exports next five years, put muscle behind trade agreements South Korea, Panama Colombia. And clarity call respect human rights times muted face tough realities. Sixteen months administration much progress, many true tests strategy lie ahead. In strategy's conclusions, Obama administration evokes even earlier era, calling political parties restore cooperation common purpose crucial success dark days Cold War. Despite intense debates time nuclear arms control, Central America détente, nearly American supported containment communism. In spirit, administration's framework deserves broad bipartisan support. We argue differences detention prisoners, methods disarm dangerous states, hard push democratic rights, costs climate change legislation. But time, rally around overriding U.S. foreign policy goals spelled strategy: renewing economy home ensure leadership abroad; defeating al-Qaeda; succeeding Afghanistan; preventing nuclear proliferation; curbing climate change; promoting international order enlightened self-interest, economic prosperity fundamental values upon America based.

Thanks read-out. That's relatively hopeful. I beginning think new OMB Director need mini-summit modernization
Fyi Sen Mitchell - he'd like discuss results AM meeting you.
Fyi - Sandy sent attached thoughts I think you'll find quite useful. I think see/call you're back.
Congratulations resumption direct talks. As evidenced activity past several weeks involvement peace process inevitably deepened need high-level U.S. intervention grown. I believe positive result. But fundamental issue remains role going forward order maximize chances diplomatic success. I. . State Play As U.S. embarks next stage Israeli-Palestinian process, faces series tactical strategic challenges regarding policy, politics personality. 1. At policy level, meager results indirect talks difficulties transitioning direct talks underscored lack trust two sides well existing substantive gaps. With direct talks begin coming days, one obstacles removed, several remain. Some may resolved connection gaining agreement direct talks. a. How handle renewal non-renewal Israel's settlement moratorium? b. What goal direct talks consensus matter parties? A comprehensive agreement permanent (CAPS) covers details? A framework agreement permanent status (FAPS) outlines governing parameters, along lines 2000 Clinton parameters? Or, less ambitiously, short (one two page) statement principles? c. What role U.S. play? Will George another U.S. official present meetings? Will Netanyahu accept that? Is argument allowing two sides deal one another without intermediary, least while, seek play U.S.? d. What U.S. event impasse breakdown? Should present bridging proposals and, so, when? e. How much work done, parallel simultaneously direct talks, U.S. Palestinians one hand U.S. Israel other? Beyond questions, I persuaded important factor likely remain Netanyahu prepared do. You witnessed first-hand difficult deal Palestinians Arab world generally; fragile Abbas's political position; indecisive be. Still, bottom, relatively clear sense positions core issues ever reach moment truth. That case Netanyahu either know prepared share who, now, neither felt urgency reach deal discomfort status quo. Assuming Bibi convinced benefits deal along lines acceptable Palestinians, occur solely basis talks Abbas, likes truly respect fears position deliver. Rather, happen feels (1) leadership U.S. administration genuinely trusts; (2) convinced combination agreement U.S. assurances meets core needs terms Israeli security international recognition Jewish character; (3) feels that, U.S. help, sell people survive -- even thrive -- politically. Getting Bibi accept core compromises enough, course. Other basic elements strategy must involve reaching effectively Israeli public ensuring strong, vocal Arab support U.S.- sponsored deal without Abbas cannot say yes Israelis lack incentive so. But point prerequisite successful peace effort U.S. convince prime minister -- various forms overt persuasion implicit pressure -- make necessary compromises. At end day, Bibi make deal, deal U.S. much Palestinians. 2. At political level, past year clearly demonstrated degree U.S. hamstrung low ratings Israel among important segments domestic Jewish constituency. This critical dimension electoral reasons, U.S.'s best chance influencing Bibi build support deal Israel home among care most. That capacity improved extent result successful July visit Netanyahu string military/security deals two countries. But must honest: sill long way go. If anything, recent Obama/Bibi illustrated new, potentially perverse dynamic: U.S. president juncture needs Israeli prime minister validate pro-Israeli credentials Israeli prime minister needs U.S. president vouch pro-peace ones. 3. At level personalities, George, skill perseverance, cannot secure serious concessions parties himself. In recent discussions, Israelis Palestinians described someone respected would make major concessions. This curse day-to-day negotiator. When ready deal, deal players perceive authority. It different Dennis Clinton Administration. This mean Mitchell crucial role going forward. Indeed, empowered active involvement. The president faces different less difficult problem. He trusted Israel and, though July meeting might altered situation somewhat, trusted Bibi. Domestically, faces reservoir skepticism issue reflects many factors, including inexcusable prejudice, could obstruct effectiveness interlocutor salesman. Besides, learned WJC's presidency, would mistake Obama get deeply invested negotiations prior end-point; time expend political capital prematurely. To so, moreover, would automatically devalue role anyone beneath him, thus making peace process whole excessively dependent involvement. Your Role Under circumstances, view, deeper involvement essential potentially highly beneficial. It selective involvement; Mitchell still must day-to-day negotiator others also must play part. In particular, I would recommend get overly mired details direct talks set questions I described (about format, goal, U.S. role, etc) critical junctures. Nor would I advise get pulled Christopher-style shuttle diplomacy would quickly depreciate value. Rather, injecting strategically right time right way, could fill gaps identified above. This uniquely placed address need higher-level mediator someone enjoys considerable credibility Israel U.S. (Bibi reportedly told someone recently prepared deal substantively Obama you). Your role would twofold 1. To serve higher-level interlocutor matters offinal status. To large degree, Abbas's positions already known; explored pushed, engage him. But probably know zone possible agreement. Not Bibi and, I believe, ideally suited begin series in-depth conversations aimed understanding key concerns, met, would need us others, far, end day, prepared go Palestinians security needs met. Bibi knows trusts you; fact, almost certainly high-level U.S. official trusts most. If succeed taking confidence work time, could pave way Israeli-U.S. understanding would underpin Israeli-Palestinian agreement. At times, require tough pushing back extreme demands (the militarily questionable request long term Israeli presence Jordan Valley one them) proposing rational alternatives. But point without getting Bibi trust level us, without feeling lose also gain, process unlikely go anywhere. To repeat, Mitchell's expense. It parallel, reinforcing process would deal one-on-one Abbas Netanyahu periodic intervals, extensive periods time. 2. To help restore US. 's image credibility Israel among important domestic constituencies. You history, background credentials Israel thus overcome suspicion Obama must contend. Over time, series visits public statements, would seek make case peace agreement positive terms, focusing benefits would bring Israelis rather costs would incur: secure recognized borders; stronger security ties U.S. others; end conflict; normal relations Arab world; strengthened international legitimacy. III. Potential Downsides Responses 1. Dragging weeds negotiations. A risk exists that, though repeated meetings Bibi Abbas, drawn detailed discussions nature territorial compromise, precise security arrangements, etc. This would unhelpful process you. There fine line discussing principles guide final outcome precise details outcome, important cross it. Your role extract Bibi important understandings parameters (e.g., security arrangements Jordan valley minimize infringements Palestinian sovereignty minimize duration residual Israeli presence) respective negotiators work details 2. Disempowering George. A related danger render George powerless creating sense everything dealt you. Besides potentially leading step down, outcome would serve interests reasons cited, effectiveness function remaining somewhat removed day-to-day specifics talks. In fact, I see it, process could end strengthening George's presently hand clarifying it. Once Bibi reached agreement broad principles, two provide instructions respective negotiators find solutions reflect them. In sense, George counterpart stronger clearer mandate currently case. 3. Involving failed enterprise. Of potential downsides, significant one ought dismissed lightly. Failure real possibility. Palestinians disarray. The Arab world profoundly divided, forthcoming successions Egypt Saudi Arabia weaken two states upon rely. And serious questionmark hovers Bibi's politics, head heart. As result, powerful argument could made would better keeping arms' length process, especially given much else plate. That said, I disagree following reasons: a. By getting involved, risk worst two worlds: associated failure (which, virtue position, inevitably would be) criticized engaged effort avert it. b. Over past year half, involved -- traveling region; seeking convince Abbas enter talks; commenting settlement freeze Jerusalem -- able escape kind involvement future. The problem engagement appeared sporadic rather strategic -- you've deployed deemed necessary get impasse rather order implement long term, well thought-out plan. I think served well. c. While one cannot means confident success, I believe agreement possible chance work effectively bring Bibi position believes costs historical compromise outweighed benefits. d. If don't try next year year half, likelihood forced deal extensively Middle East -- albeit peacemaking crisis-managing mode. Without movement peace process, Abbas could depart, Fayyad's state-building plan could gone smoke, hostilities might break Israel, Syria Hizbollah U.S. would deal Iran even less hospitable regional climate.

Verma, Richard R <VermaRR@state.gov> Friday, November 5, 2010 6:05 AM H; Lew, Jacob J; Mills, Cheryl D FW: The Cable: Granger seeking chairmanship State foreign ops subcommittee The Cable: Granger seeking chairmanship State foreign ops subcommittee Granger seeking chairmanship State foreign ops subcommittee Posted: 03 NOV 2010 1131 AM PDT Texas Congresswoman Kay Granger seek chairmanship State Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, according spokesman, ending rumors would forgo post favor position. Although decisions made, last night Granger ranking Republican panel clear frontrunner job. She would succeed current chairwoman Nita Lowey(D-NY), served chairwoman since 2006. "Congresswoman Granger interested continuing chair state foreign operations appropriations subcommittee," Matt LeffingwelL press secretary, toldThe Cable Wednesday. When power switches Congress, complicated game musical chairs begins senior members jockey committee subcommittee chairs. Just highest-ranking minority member panel doesn't mean one automatically takes chairmanship. But Granger succeed Lowey, play large role writing bills appropriate money State Department operations, USAID, foreign operations, foreign assistance, humanitarian assistance, many things. Those accounts face unprecedented pressure next year GOP led Congress looking spending cuts don't strong domestic constituencies. Last month, identified Granger one 10 Republicans stand influential next Congress GOP won control House. Since then, we've received several e-mails sources heard Granger would forgo subcommittee chairmanship pursue leadership another panel. We've heard Ander Crenshaw (R-FL), third-ranking Republican panel, eyeing chairmanship expectation Granger would step aside. (Mark Kirk (R-IL), second-ranking Republican subcommittee, elected Tuesday night become junior senator Illinois, seat held Barack Obama.) So would subcommittee chairwoman Granger handle responsibility writing State foreign ops appropriations bill? Here's reported October: Although [Granger] supported bill put forth year current chairwoman Nita Lowey CD-N.Y.), criticizedthe increases foreign-ops budget, saying, "We also face continued concern country economy devastating effects skyrocketing deficits debt." She's strong supporter balanced budget amendment, doesn't bode well foreign-aid funding dismal fiscal environment. Granger also serves defense subcommittee, placing intersection debate balance national security budget shift resources defense diplomacy development. Here seems favor Pentagon, saying June, "I want sure aren't increasing foreign aid expense troops." Her lack support international organizations criticized group Citizens Global Solutions, gave "F" 2007to 2009 rating. Granger also board efforts eliminate aid countries performing internal reform, explained expressing opposition funding Senegalese government State Department's Millennium Challenge Corporation. "We can't give money say put whatever doing," said. The committee leadership assignments won't doled least two three weeks, Hill sources report. But Granger's bid successful, she'll instantly influential. The fiscal 2011 State Foreign Ops bill still completed Congress, despite fiscal year began Oct. 1. The stop gap funding measure funding programs since then, known "continuing resolution," expires December. The lame duck Democratic led Congress unlikely able pass full appropriations bills way door, likely pass another short term continuing resolution. That would leave final work actual bill incoming class led GOP next year. You subscribed email updates The Cable Email delivery powered Google To stop receiving emails, may unsubscribe now.

Madame Secretary, passing along statement Aung San Suu Kyi review. Thanks Dan STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON Release Aung San Suu Kyl Today I join billions people around world welcome long-overdue release Burmese democracy leader Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi house arrest. Aung San Suu Kyi endured enormous personal sacrifice peaceful struggle bring democracy human rights Burma, including unjustified detention past twenty years. The Burmese regime repeatedly rejected offers engage dialogue work together, trying instead silence isolate her. Through all, Aung San Suu Kyi's commitment Burmese people wavered. The United States calls Burma's leaders ensure Aung San Suu Kyi's release unconditional may travel, associate fellow citizens, express views, participate political activities without restriction. They also immediately unconditionally release Burma's 2,100 political prisoners. We urge Burma's leaders break repressive policies begin inclusive dialogue Aung San Suu Kyi democratic ethnic leaders towards national reconciliation peaceful, prosperous, democratic future. ###

Here Republican former Secretaries State op ed, ran today's wash post. The Republican case ratifying New START bn)://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/01/AR2010120104598.html?hpid=topnews By Henry A. Kissinger, George P. Shultz, James A. Baker III, Lawrence S. Eagleburger Colin L. Powell Thursday, December 2, 2010; Republican presidents long led crucial fight protect United States nuclear dangers. That Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan George H.W. Bush negotiated SALT I, START I START II agreements. It President George W. Bush negotiated Moscow Treaty. All four recognized reducing number nuclear arms open, verifiable manner would reduce risk nuclear catastrophe increase stability America's relationship Soviet Union and, later, Russian Federation. The world safer today decades-long effort reduce supply nuclear weapons. As result, urge Senate ratify New START treaty signed President Obama Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. It modest appropriate continuation START I treaty expired almost year ago. It reduces number nuclear weapons side deploys enabling United States maintain strong nuclear deterrent preserving flexibility deploy forces see fit. Along obligation protect homeland, United States responsibilities allies around world. The commander nuclear forces testified 1,550 warheads allowed treaty sufficient missions - seven former nuclear commanders agree. The defense secretary, chairman Joint Chiefs Staff head Missile Defense Agency - originally appointed Republican president - argue New START essential national defense. We make recommendation exact timing Senate ratification vote. That matter administration Senate leaders. The important thing bipartisan support treaty, previous nuclear arms treaties did. Although us initial questions New START, administration officials provided reasonable answers. We believe compelling reasons Republicans support ratification. First, agreement emphasizes verification, providing valuable window Russia's nuclear arsenal. Since original START expired last December, Russia required provide notifications changes strategic nuclear arsenal, United States unable conduct on-site inspections. Each day, America's understanding Russia's arsenal degraded, resources diverted national security tasks try fill gaps. Our military planners increasingly lack best possible insight Russia's activity strategic nuclear arsenal, making difficult carry nuclear deterrent mission. Second, New START preserves ability deploy effective missile defenses. The testimonies military commanders civilian leaders make clear treaty limit U.S. missile defense plans. Although treaty prohibits conversion existing launchers intercontinental submarine-based ballistic missiles, military leaders say want expensive less effective building new ones defense purposes. Finally, Obama administration agreed provide modernization infrastructure essential maintaining nuclear arsenal. Funding efforts become part negotiations ratification process. The administration put forth 10-year plan spend $84 billion Energy Department's nuclear weapons complex. Much credit getting administration add $14 billion originally proposed $70 billion modernization goes Sen. Jon Kyl, Arizona Republican vigilant effort. Implementing modernization program timely fashion would important ensuring nuclear arsenal maintained appropriately next decade beyond. Although United States needs strong reliable nuclear force, chief nuclear danger today comes Russia rogue states Iran North Korea potential nuclear material fall hands terrorists. Given pressing dangers, question arms control treaty Russia matters. It matters parties' interest transparency stability strategic nuclear relationship. It also matters Russia's cooperation needed make progress rolling back Iranian North Korean programs. Russian help needed continue work secure "loose nukes" Russia elsewhere. And Russian assistance needed improve situation Afghanistan, breeding ground international terrorism. Obviously, United States sign arms control agreements make friends. Any treaty must considered merits. But agreement clearly national interest, consider ramifications ratifying it. Whenever New START brought debate, encourage senators focus national security. There plenty opportunities battle domestic political issues linked future American economy. With country facing dual threats unemployment growing federal debt bomb, anticipate significant conflict Democrats Republicans. It is, however, national interest ratify New START.

OPINION DECEMBER 7, 2010 New Start: Ratify, With Caveats The treaty helpfully reinstates on-site verification Russian nuclear forces, senators make clear Moscow don't see limiting U.S. missile defenses. By CONDOLEEZZA RICE When U.S. President Bush Russian President Putin signed Moscow Treaty 2002, addressed nuclear threat reducing offensive weapons,-as predecessors had. But Moscow Treaty different. It came wake America's 2001 withdrawal Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty 1972, first time United States Russia reduced offensive nuclear weapons agreement place constrained missile defenses. Breaking link offensive force reductions limits defense marked key moment establishment new nuclear agenda longer focused Cold War face-off Warsaw Pact NATO. The real threat world's dangerous weapons could end hands world's dangerous regimes—or terrorists would launch attacks devastating 9/11. And since rogue states also pursued ballistic missiles, defenses would (alongside offensive weapons) integral security United States allies. It context consider potential contribution New Start treaty U.S. national security. The treaty modest, reducing offensive nuclear weapons 1,550 side—more enough deterrence. While treaty puts limits launchers, U.S. military commanders testified able maintain triad bombers, submarine-based delivery vehicles land-based delivery vehicles. Moreover, treaty helpfully reinstates on-site verification Russian nuclear forces, lapsed expiration original Start treaty last year. Meaningful verification significant achievement Presidents Reagan George H.W. Bush, reinstatement crucial. Still, legitimate concerns New Start must addressed ratification process and, treaty ratified, future monitoring Obama administration's commitments. First, smaller forces make modernization nuclear infrastructure even urgent. Sen. Jon Kyl Arizona led valiant effort regard. Thanks efforts, roughly $84 billion allocated Department Energy's nuclear weapons complex. Ratifying treaty help cement commitments, Congress fully fund president's program. Congress also support Defense Department modernizing launchers suggested recent defense strategy study coauthored former Secretary Defense Bill Perry former National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley. Second, Senate must make absolutely clear ratifying treaty, U.S. re-establishing Cold War link offensive forces missile defenses. New Start's preamble worrying regard, recognizes "interrelationship" two. Administration officials testified link, treaty limit U.S. missile defenses. But Congress ensure future Defense Department budgets reflect this. Moscow contends current U.S. missile-defense plans acceptable treaty. But U.S. must remain fully free explore deploy best defenses—not imagined today. That includes pursuing potential qualitative breakthroughs quantitative increases. I personally witnessed Moscow's tendency interpret every utterance binding commitment. The Russians need understand U.S. use full-range American technology talent improve ability intercept destroy ballistic missiles hostile countries. Russia reassured fact nuclear arsenal far sophisticated large degraded missile defenses. In addition, welcome agreements missile-defense cooperation reached Lisbon recently NATO Russia improve transparency allow Moscow Washington work together field. After all, North Korean Iranian missile threat United States, international stability broadly. Ratification treaty also sold way buy Moscow's cooperation issues. The men Kremlin know loose nukes hands terrorists—some operate Russia's unstable south—are dangerous. That alone give governments reason work together beyond New Start address threat tactical nuclear weapons, smaller dispersed, therefore harder monitor control. Russia knows nuclear Iran volatile Middle East development North Korea's arsenal interest. Russia lives neighborhoods. That helps explain Moscow's toughening stance toward Tehran longstanding concern Pyongyang. The issue Senate place New Start America's future security. Nuclear weapons us long time. After treaty, focus must stopping dangerous proliferators—not reductions U.S. Russian strategic arsenals, really threat international stability. A modern smaller nuclear arsenal increasingly sophisticated defenses right bases U.S. nuclear security (and allies) going forward. With right commitments understandings, ratification New Start treaty contribute goal. If Senate enters commitments understandings record ratification, New Start deserves bipartisan support, whether lame-duck session next year.

Good public movement START Judd Gregg. G.O.P. Support Arms Treaty By PETER BAKER Another Republican senator signaled Tuesday may vote new arms control treaty Russia comes vote Senate adjourns year later month. Senator Judd Gregg New Hampshire, run re-election, said hopes Senate get chance vote treaty, known New Start, right deal tax cuts spending resolution keep government operating. "Start important issue. It fully debated. I leaning towards supporting it," told Andrea Mitchell MSNBC. "I haven't made final decision," added, noting Senator Jon Kyl Arizona, lead Republican negotiator treaty, still concerns. "He reservations, I believe many reservations addressed," Mr. Gregg said. President Obama made passing treaty top foreign policy priority lame-duck session. Under Constitution, approving treaty requires two-thirds super-majority, 67 votes, meaning Mr. Obama needs nine Republicans assuming 58 Democrats stick him.

Snowe Supports Senate Ratification New START Treaty December 10, 2010 WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Olympia). Snowe (R-Maine) released following statement support Senate ratification New START Treaty: "The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known New START, signed United States Russia April 8th transmitted advice consent Senate May 13th year. Since then, U.S. Senate held 18 hearings member Senate Select Committee Intelligence, I worked colleagues scrutinize agreement ensure classified matters properly vetted.

"I confident New START provide predictability relationship Russia thus enhance global stability, importantly, national security. Therefore, Majority moves consider New START framework allows sufficient debate amendments, I intend support Resolution Advice Consent."
One START update: new START remains mix next week, fit schedule firmly decided. On Monday 3.00 pm, Senate vote cloture tax bill. They expect obtain cloture.
