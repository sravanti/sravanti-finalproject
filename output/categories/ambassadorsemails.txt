Cover story Economist week. Very big issue I Japan Korea. Korean parliamentarians want get women economic growth G20 agenda lead next year advocating Japan advance issue APEC leading year. On another note, sad Smith Bagley. He good person one biggest fans. Women work We it! Dec 30th 2009 From The Economist print edition The rich world's quiet revolution: women gradually taking workplace Getty Images AT A time world short causes celebration, candidate: within next months women cross 50% threshold become majority American workforce. Women already make majority university graduates OECD countries majority professional workers several rich countries, including United States. Women run many world's great companies, PepsiCo America Areva France. Women's economic empowerment arguably biggest social change times. Just generation ago, women largely confined repetitive, menial jobs. They routinely subjected casual sexism expected abandon careers married children. Today running organisations treated second-class citizens. Millions women given control lives. And millions brains put productive use. Societies try resist trend—most notably Arab countries, also Japan southern European countries—will pay heavy price form wasted talent frustrated citizens. This revolution achieved modicum friction (see article). Men have, large, welcomed women's invasion workplace. Yet even positive changes incomplete unsatisfactory. This particular advance comes two stings. The first women still under- represented top companies. Only 2% bosses America's largest companies 5% peers Britain women. They also paid significantly less men average. The second juggling work child-rearing difficult. Middle-class couples routinely complain little time children. But biggest losers poor children— particularly places like America Britain combined high levels female participation labour force reluctance spend public money child care. Dealing juggle These two problems closely related. Many women feel choose children careers. Women prosper high-pressure companies 20s drop dramatic numbers 30s find almost impossible regain earlier momentum. Less-skilled women trapped poorly paid jobs hand-to-mouth child-care arrangements. Motherhood, sexism, issue: America, childless women earn almost much men, mothers earn significantly less. And mothers' relative poverty also disadvantages children. Demand female brains helping alleviate problems. Even new theories warm-hearted women making inherently superior workers bunk (see article), several trends favour educated sex, including "war talent" growing flexibility workplace. Law firms, consultancies banks rethinking "up out" promotion systems losing many able women. More 90% companies Germany Sweden allow flexible working. And new technology making easier redesign work sorts family-friendly ways. Women certainly performed better past decade men. In European Union women filled 6m 8m new jobs created since 2000. In America three four people thrown work since "mancession" began male. And shift towards women likely continue: 2011 2.6m female male university students America. The light hand state All argues, mostly, letting market work. That stopped calls hefty state intervention Scandinavian sort. Norway used threats quotas dramatic effect. Some 40% legislators women. All Scandinavian countries provide plenty state-financed nurseries. They highest levels female employment world far fewer social problems plague Britain America. Surely, comes argument, way speed revolution—and improve tough lives many working women children? If means massive intervention, shape affirmative-action programmes across-the-board benefits parents sorts, answer no. To begin with, promoting people basis sex illiberal unfair, stigmatises beneficiaries. And practical problems. Lengthy periods paid maternity leave put firms hiring women, helps explain Swedish women work public sector Sweden lower proportion women management America does. But plenty cheaper, subtler ways governments make life easier women. Welfare states designed women stayed home. They need change way operate. German schools, instance, close midday. American schools shut two months summer. These things changed without huge cost. Some popular American charter schools offer longer school days shorter summer holidays. And, without going Scandinavian lengths, America could invest children: spends lower share GDP public child-care almost rich country, rich country refuses provide mothers paid maternity leave. Barack Obama needs measure campaign rhetoric "real family values". Still, nagging problems overshadow dramatic progress women made recent decades. During second world war, America's menfolk front, government summon image Rosie Riveter, flexed muscle "We Can Do It" slogan, encourage women workforce. Today women marching workplace ever larger numbers taking sledgehammer remaining glass ceilings.

Recruit Afghan women sell war Europeans: CIA report WASHINGTON, March 27, 2010 (AFP) - A CIA expert called recruiting Afghan women public relations bid persuade skeptical Europeans support NATO-led war effort, according document leaked Friday. "Afghan women could serve ideal messengers humanizing" mission European audiences, particularly France, according CIA analysis, posted WikiLeaks, whistleblower website. The views Afghan women would carry special weight could express "their aspirations future, fears Taliban victory," said. The Central Intelligence Agency declined confirm deny document genuine.

The report CIA expert "strategic communications" State Department analysts public opinion warned popular support war Europe weak could easily collapse, citing recent fall Dutch government issue. "The tone previous debate suggests spike French German casualties Afghan civilian casualties could become tipping point converting passive opposition active calls immediate withdrawal," said. The analysis, dated March 11, suggested public relations strategies drum support war Germany France, maintain third fourth largest troop deployments Afghanistan. "Outreach initiatives create media opportunities Afghan women share stories French, German, European women could help overcome pervasive skepticism among women Western Europe toward ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) mission," said. Public relations efforts could "tap acute French concern civilians refugees," report said, suggesting highlighting polls show Afghans support presence coalition troops. Such approach could stress potential dangers facing Afghan civilians NATO-led troops defeated "leverage French (and European) guilt abandoning them."

How Come havent? This against. Betrayed They said save Afghanistan's women. So come haven't? BY VALERIE M. HUDSON, PATRICIA LEIDL I MAY 10, 2010 One day November 2009, Helmand province's capital Lashkar Gah, group Afghan widows divorcees met Patricia, commissioned write series success stories U.S. Agency International Development (USAID). All women 20s, 30s, 40s looked 60s. Until recently, none could work possessed marketable skills, could neither read write, risk killed left homes. A number women said that, program -- focused tailoring basic literacy -- children used weep night hunger. COMMENTS (22) SHARE: Twitter Reddit Buzz EMore... As Patricia prepared leave, women fluttered around like moths, touching sleeves speaking once. 'What saying?" Pat asked young Pashto-speaking interpreter. "They telling go back country ask people abandon them. The women Afghanistan don't want leave. They quite literally die Taliban return," said. In recent question-and-answer period one universities, Brigham Young, student asked Gen. David Petraeus whether anyone thought ask women Afghanistan felt U.S. hopes incorporate "reformed" Taliban governance structures Americans leave. Carefully avoiding word "women," general assured questioning student "moderate" Taliban would eligible rehabilitation. Left unaddressed definition "moderate," clearly depends sit: If sit burqa, thing "moderate" Taliban. Petraeus might find easy sidestep question happen Afghanistan's women "moderate" Taliban come back, it's likely haunt long time. Without security women security -- we've done protect it, moral practical obligation stay Afghanistan. In 2001, George W. Bush's administration interpreted first post-invasion photos Afghan girls heading school Afghan women unveiling faces tangible evidence conditions improving benighted land. A months invasion, 2002 State Union address, Bush announced, "The last time met chamber, mothers daughters Afghanistan captives homes, forbidden working going school. Today women free part Afghanistan's new government." The Americans strong-armed handful women loya jirga drafted Afghan Constitution. They strong-armed quota women Afghan national legislature -- something even American women treated to. U.S. troops built schools girls pushed women included local shuras, USAID ripped page Greg Mortenson's Three Cups Tea facilitated new training educational opportunities women. But current administration, despite female secretary State new Office Global Women's Issues, appears ditching women Afghanistan like blind date gone bad. You go back 10 months find sustained rhetoric President Barack Obama importance assuring security women Afghanistan. Since then, especially since last year's Afghan election, fine words sitting president disappeared. Many fine actions gone, too. Push local shuras including women 2002? Yes. Push local shuras including women 2010? Forget it. It's difficult understand why. Afghanistan crisis. The cynical policies characterized early mid-stages occupation come home roost. President Hamid Karzai rogue's gallery kleptocrats, human rights abusers, drug lords hanging onto power even Karzai declares open season United Nations accusing senior bureaucrats organizing widespread voter fraud consolidated hold power. In meantime, women taken back seat realpolitik exigencies coalition exit strategy. But suffering real, Afghanistan's poverty chaos affect women possibly all. Matemal mortality Afghanistan still makes world's top three list, nine years U.S. invasion, resulting life expectancy women 46. In countryside, Taliban zealots spray acid girls' faces going school -- 27 percent first place. According recent survey U.N. Development Fund Women, 87 percent Afghan women report beaten regular basis. In July last year, U.N. Assistance Mission Afghanistan (UNAMA) issued report represents stinging official condemnation Karzai administration's abysmal track record women date. The report concluded, "The current reality ... women denied fundamental human rights risk violence course seeking justice crimes perpetrated them." Last year Karzai pardoned well-connected political thugs -- witnesses -- gang-raped woman bayonet. Her husband, battled redress, assassinated soon thereafter. Women dare speak widespread trampling rights face almost certain death murderers face 100 percent impunity. For warlords mujahideen make upper echelons Karzai government, issue gender equality always unwanted appendage U.S. involvement -- one could easily dispensed deployment flowery speeches token appointment lone female minister Ministry Women's Affairs. Indeed, recent "election," Karzai felt secure enough sign law series repressive measures designed repeal minimal gains women made since Taliban ouster. Although eventually forced back legislation allows Shiite husbands rape wives, Karzai successfully signed law legislation denies severely limits women's rights inherit, divorce, guardianship children. The Shiite Personal Status Law also legalizes forced marriage rape minors. It allows men exert almost total control female relatives offers power prohibit women's access work, education, health care denying right leave homes except "legitimate" purposes. Even Karzai's wife -- doctor whose skills desperately needed -- strictly sequestered. And sounds bad, wait Americans leave. This women. Gender inequality affects girls women, boys men. In Afghanistan, women rarely able leave house, young boys often forced carry unwarranted amount financial responsibility, something limits prospects well. Nor even Afghanistan. As Secretary State Hillary Clinton said March, "The subjugation women threat national security United States." On geopolitical level, Valerie's research found states higher levels violence women also less peaceful internationally. Indeed, violence women better predictor bellicosity level democracy, level wealth, presence Islamic civilization. In 2010 study, Valerie, along Brad Thayer, also found high levels gender inequality strong aggravating factor development Islamic suicide terrorism. So, given desperate need Afghanistan's women serious consequences worldwide, aren't help? One reason fallacious notion, common among coalition members, Afghan "culture" allow gender equality forcing issue undermine Western interests. Pat heard openly one coalition representative, prefers remain anonymous: 'There point pushing gender equality. It alienate [Afghans]." Of course, "them" refers men. But decision-makers forget culture fixed, highly mutable dynamic. More 30 years ago, Afghan women attending universities, teaching, working doctors, nurses, professors. Far black hole gender apartheid, Afghanistan, though impoverished, progressive many Muslim neighbors. Furthermore, many young Afghans open new ways things. In 2009, hundreds Afghan men women bravely stood together Kabul protest Karzai's support new oppressive Shiite family law. If Americans assume Afghan men Neanderthals incapable sympathizing plight sisters, wrong. Another, unmentionable reason may chauvinism permeates Western military culture. U.S. military life, despite increasing female recruitment even "female engagement teams," remains bastion masculinity, little sensitivity toward questions female rights. For military leadership recruits alike, immured almost exclusively male world, complete absence women Afghanistan's streets villages elicited comment Marines surrounded Pat, though woman noticed immediately. And ready availability pornography U.S. bases, coupled seamier depictions life West, damages prospects gender equality extension, Western interests. As one young, well-educated 24-year-old Afghan male pointed out, "Your culture respect women all. Look pornography way exploit women ways can't even imagine. Do call progress?" Added another Afghan USAID programmer working Gardez, man 50s father three girls, "It would better coalition could figure way limit kind material." We better -- much better. The Obama administration must instill military personnel senior diplomats necessity fully protecting women's rights. Key educating gender equality furthers Western interests security. The military spend less time courting "moderate" Taliban time showing Afghan community leaders gender equality -- including female access family planning methods -- result healthier families, lower maternal child death rates, poverty alleviation, greater self-determination. Gender included component governance training placed front center upcoming "peace jirga" include Taliban. Indeed, let half negotiating team representing government coalition female: yes, full 50 percent. Women must also represented government. As Melanne Verveer, U.S. ambassador large global women's issues, noted last summer, speaking female politicians Afghanistan, "There one minister cabinet, powerless. There low percentage women civil service. There one female governor, Bamiyan." Obama must insist important changes women leave make subsequent aid contingent upon maintenance strong presence women Afghan government. Better yet, coalition needs support "regime change" building democratic institutions groom moderate, educated middle class young women men eventually take over. Over two-thirds Afghan population age 25, either real opportunity social change -- educated given chance shape society progressive way -- major obstacle, find without jobs, unable marry, burdened retrograde attitudes means male female. We must hold Afghanistan responsible treaty obligations U.N. Convention Elimination Discrimination Women (CEDAVV) U.N. Security Council Resolution 1325 women, peace, security. Afghanistan signed CEDAW without reservations (the United States interestingly, not), means committed passing whatever legislation necessary implement wide-ranging principles gender equality enshrined treaty. This includes taking measures ensure women enjoy basic human rights fundamental freedoms men, place legal judicial procedures protect rights women, taking measures eliminate sexist discrimination, lastly, submitting national reports every four years U.N. advisory group international experts, CEDAW Committee, ensure transparency measures country taken implement treaty's provisions. Unanimously adopted 2000, UNSC 1325 marked first time Security Council recognized disproportionate unique impact armed conflict women stressed importance equal full participation active agents peace security. Needless say, women currently enjoy fundamental freedoms men, indeed, passing Shiite family law, many worse before. To change this, coalition needs stay Afghanistan. Withdrawing critical juncture would doom Afghanistan entire region instability effectively consign one half population premature death existence fit animals. We creating shameful American tradition leaving women better (Afghanistan) -- even much worse (Iraq) -- U.S. troops intervened. On basis America's track record, women around world faith U.S. soldiers improve security. Despite Clinton's remarks link gender equality security, ground Americans act women's well-being, end, peripherally related issue peace. As seen, view could wrong. Verveer's benchmarks concerning Afghanistan right ones: "Progress Afghanistan must measured military terms, also terms social, political, economic participation women rebuilding Afghanistan safeguarding human rights." American women right ask sending sons daughters fight die Afghan women continue treated like inferior subspecies humanity. When break faith Afghan women, break faith American women.

In another show support, Secretary Clinton Danish Foreign Minister Lene Espersen meet Tuesday morning group women leaders. Regardless high-profile backing, many women say little faith process produce anything aside paper unkept promises. "Women tired conferences; government going show commitments," said Selay Ghaffar, Afghan Women's Network board member. "We want things change." And remains unclear many Afghans outside Kabul, men women, paying attention yet another gathering discuss future. "Women provinces don't even know this," said Zainab, young math teacher Helmand province. "I would say 60 percent women idea going on." Others say presence one two women Kabul Conference isn't enough make difference. And say fear recent move NATO empower local militias fight Taliban, particularly southern Afghanistan. "This dangerous," said Shahida Hussain, human rights advocate Kandahar worked community organizer Taliban years. "We militias communist years Afghanistan destroyed. We fear war again." Women leaders say want peace glad welcome back former fighters, respect women's constitutional guarantee equal protections law. "Women constituent part bodies outlined Afghanistan Peace Reintegration Plan," said women statement end meeting. "Women's rights achievements compromised peace negotiations accords." In meantime, women continue fight voice Tuesday approaches. After weeklong flurry conference calls, embassy meetings, lunchtime gatherings, two women aside government ministers slated speak. And small victory women, international officials agreed Pakzad's assessment pledging women would involved going forward. "I agree, consulted," said da Mistura, appearing contradict Afghan finance minister, moments earlier said women's views would included. "As usual, paying lip service fault that."

PVerveer Saturday, December 18, 2010 1:22 PM child marriage defeat The defeat Child Marriage bill, I fear, harbinger what's come. After passing Senate unanimously, every expectation would fly House suspension. How became abortion issue truly distressing. We work cut us. On another note, ran Ray Shaista night. They recently Pakistan stayed Zardari whole time. It might make sense someone brief Ray. Zardari considers informal ambassador US. z..L ;; ;•=r-i e forc,; e Posted: i7 Dec 2010 03:08 PM PS' Incoming House Foreign Affairs chairwoman ileana Ros-Lehtinen. (R-FL) defeated bill Thursday evening would committed United States combating forced child marriages abroad, invoking concerns legislation's cost funds could uses finance abortions. The episode highlights tough road °barna administration face advancing women's rights foreign aid agenda next Congressional session. Non-governmental organizations, women's rights advocates, and. lawmakers parties spent years developing lobbying "International Protecting Girls Preventing Child Marriage Act 2010," House failed pass vote Thursday. The bill failed even though 241 Congressmen voted, 166 voted against, House Speaker Nancy Petosi (D-CA) brought "suspension rules." This procedure advantage allowing amendments changes bill, carries disadvantage requiring two-thirds the. votes passage. ; Even still, supporters parties fully expected bill garner 290 votes needed -- right bill. failed. After all, passed Senate unanimously Dee. co-sponsorship several Republicans. including Appropriations Committee ranking Republican Thad Cochran (R-MS), Foreign Relations Committee member Roger ‘Vick-er (P.-MS), human rights advocate Sam Brownback (R-KS). passed, bill would authorized president provide assistance "to prevent incidence child marriage developing countries promotion educational, health, economic, social, legal empowerment girls women." It would also mandated administration develop multi-year strategy issue State Department include incidence forced child marriage annual evaluation countries' human rights practices. So happened? Ros-Lehtinen first argued bill simply unaffordable. In Dec. i6" objected Post bill, would Si.08 million five years, criticized providing accounting much U.S. already spending (Alba The ' said bill would authorize $1o8 million, would require $67 million outlays fiscal years 2011 2015. Ros-Lehtinen introduced version bill, said would cost $1 million. But fact sheet gDF.), organizations supporting original legislation said Ros-Lehtinen's bill removed implementation procedures gave legislation teeth. "Without activities, bill becomes merely strategy actual implementation. And without implementation strategy, bill extraordinarily limited impact," wrote. Regardless, supporters still thought bill would pass House Republican leadership come it. But one hour vote, every Republican House office received message bill GOP leadership, known Whip Alert, saying leadership Nyould vote "no" bill encouraging Republicans same. The last line alert particularly shocked supporters. "There also concerns funding directed NGOs promote perform abortion efforts combat child marriage could usurped way overturn pro-life laws," alert read. The bill doesn't contain funding abortion activities federal funding abortion activities already ; prohibited what's known almenè" boiler plate language appropriations bills since 1973. Invoking abortion issue sent bill's supporters reeling. They believed little stunt, considering Republican pro-life senators carefully reviewed legislation concluded would impact abortion issue. Rep. Stephen LaTourrette (R-OH) - Republican leadership invoking abortion issue defeat forced child marriage act floor speech .Friday morning. "Yesterday I floor I co-sponsor [on] piece legislation [Rep. Betty McCollum (D-MN)] would moved money, new money, would moved money societies coercing young girls marriage... could make sure stay school they're forced marriage age 12 13," LaTourette said. "Ail sudden fiscal argument. When didn't work people add abortion element it. This partisan place. I'm Republican. I'm glad beat butt election, comes time when, enough enough." But late LaTourette Republicans fought hard bill, including Aaron Schoch, (R-11). The bill even less likely pass next year, GOP control House Ros-Lehtinen control Foreign Affairs committee. The main author bill Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), incensed bill failed House. -The action House floor stopping Child 'Marriage bill tonight endanger lives millions women. girls around world," Durbin said Thursday statement. "These.voung girls, enslaved marriage, brutalized many die young bodies torn apart giving birth. Those voted continue barbaric practice brought shame Capitol Hill." For NGO women's advocacy community, implications defeat extend much bill. They also saw Republicans invoke abortion issue objecting International Violence Against Women Act expect new Congress push reinstatement "Mexico City Policy," would prevent federal funding organizations even discuss abortion. "Any time health bill women girls comes House floor, we're going see debate like one saw," said one advocacy leader supported bill. "It's hard imagine development bills going pass environment." The protection women girls major focus Secretary State Hillary Clinton, promised elevate issue Thursday rolling State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy Development Review. She said forced child marriage "a clear unacceptable violation human rights", "the Department State categorically denounces cases child marriage child abuse". State's Ambassador Large Global Women's Issues Melanne Verveer worked hard issue behind scenes. But eleventh hour, going got tough, bill's supporters said administration nowhere found. In October, White House decided waive penalties Child Soldiers Prevention Act, another Durbin led bill NCO community supports. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimates 6o million girls developing countries ages 20 24 married reached 18. The Population Council, reproductive child health, estimates number increase million next decade current trends continue. ! One two biggest problems identified Afghanistan-Pakistan Strategy Review released Thursday (?• :) Pakistani militasy's failure crack terrorist groups using Pakistan's tribal areas safe - haven launch attacks across border Afghanistan. Pakistan • major offensive, involving approximately go,000 troops, extremists South Waziristan October 2009, military also undertaken efforts stamp militants border areas. However, military yet launch offensive military operations North Waziristan, insurgent groups wreaking havoc Afghanistan reside. Pakistan's envoy Washington, Ambassador Husain Haggai* reacted report saying Pakistan engage isla.mist groups North Waziristan, including •Hartgani network (no relation), sufficient support areas Pakistan's government effort, confident mission completed effectively. "Pakistan made clear fighting terrorists threat existence modern democratic nation. We fight groups parts country," Haqqani said exclusive interview The Cable. "But follow timelines suit capabilities lead success." Haqqani said Pakistani army, taken fight six seven regions inside Pakistan domestic militant groups operate suffered thousands casualties process, simply position expand war extremists now. "Right now, it's question operational capability readiness. Our armed forces engaged dealing flood relief work," said. "We see resources allocate part country, rather political factors responsible waiting period." He also noted "there fragile consensus Pakistan favor military action regional elements," Pakistan's government choice make decision attack North Waziristan groups timeline prioritized Pakistani considerations American ones. "Sometimes it's easy allies tell us us tell allies do. But everyone makes decisions based perceptions analysis ground realities," Haqqani said. In several discussions Pakistani officials, even complicated picture Pakistani position attacking groups North Waziristan emerges. The Pakistanis largely believe U.S. government unrealistic terms timelines wants cracking terrorist safe havens along Afghanistan- Pakistan border, existed decades. , "There always gap two countries Americans want things done quickly done way," another Pakistani government official said. ; A third senior Pakistani official said many Pakistanis feel ()barna administration placing much blame Pakistan lank progress 'U.S.-led war Afghanistan. 'The U.S. keeps telling Pakistan more, Pakistan keeps telling U.S. certain questions speeding building Afghan army, establishing real process toward reconciliation, providing Pakistan means large scale operations," official said. The United States provided Pakistan several billions dollars military economic aid support war domestic insurgents. But many Pakistani government criticized say characterize slow arrival funds, say case small address Pakistan's severe problems. "It's simplistic measure success amount assistance provided Pakistan," one Pakistani official said. In remarks delivered rollout strateu review Thursday, President Obama diplomatic discussing administration's ongoing drive push Pakistan North Waziristan. "Increasingly, Pakistani government recognizes terrorist networks border regions threat countries, especially Pakistan. We've welcomed major Pakistani offensives tribal regions. We continue help strengthen Pakistanis' capacity root terrorists," said Obama. "Nevertheless, progress come fast enough. So continue insist Pakistani leaders terrorist safe havens within borders must dealt with." Undersecretary Defense Policy Michele Flournoy acknowledged interview day work done relationship Pakistanis willing fully support U.S. NATO-led mission Afghanistan. "Given ups downs historical relationship Pakistan, fear abandonment," said. "Their calculus much affected long-term commitment feel us working strategic partnership." The White House recognizes efforts fallen short far. "The bottom line Pakistan country little influence, little access little credibility," one Obama's aides to■..-:), The New York Times. The administration's official line, therefore, agree Pakistani government express sensitivity claim simply can't expand war extremists time. "We would like move tomorrow, would like take people tomorrow," new U.S. Ambassador Pakistan Cameron Munter. "But understand they're telling us honestly capacity military, able, convinced move in." But many Washington, open-ended delay Pakistan.s promise expand military operations North. Waziristan represents strategic choice, result military's operational limitations. But whatever Pakistan's reasons, delay doesn't inspire confidence Obama administration meet timelines making progress Afghanistan. "Pakistan, meanwhile, iS hedging bets, supporting proxy actors like Quetta Shura Taliban Haos iani Network might counter Indian interests Kabul United States allies eventually withdraw," Andrew Extnn Center New American Security. 'The insurgent sanctuaries Pakistan one two Achilles heels NATO strategy." ‘0 tt " Posted: 17 Dec iOO C 4:42 AM PST In rare instance bipartisanship, House Representatives moved pass resolution Friday honoring life work recently departed Ambassador Richard Holbrooke. The resolution C, sponsored outgoing House Appropriations State Foreign Ops Subcommittee chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-NY), cosponsored incoming House Foreign Affairs chairwoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Howard Berman (D-CA), Mike Turner (R-OH). The bill "a concurrent resolution honoring exceptional achievements Ambassador Richard Holbrooke recognizing significant contributions made United States national security, humanitarian causes peaceful resolutions international conflict." "The passing Ambassador Holbrooke Monday, December 13th, great loss American people," Lowey said statement. "One nation's talented diplomats, Richard Holbrooke possessed fierce determination unsurpassed brilliance advocating American security, diplomatic, development interests around world - Southeast Asia post-Cold War Europe, United Nations, recently Afghanistan Pakistan. His exceptional accomplishments peace-maker, diplomat, writer, scholar, manager mentor define legacy one true great foreign policy giants time." Ros-Lehtinen praised Holbrooke "one consequential world diplomats last half-century," said "his tireless work pursuit United States national interests international peace put us debt." After praising career -- included two stints assistant secretary state, peace negotiator Balkans, U.S. ambassador U.N., service U.S. special representative Afghanistan Pakistan -- Ros- Lehtinen called reform United Nations protection Israel within bodies. "In New York UN, [Holbrooke] much heavy lifting Congressionally-led efforts rein UN spending, make equitable dues paid United States, improve standing Israel multinational body," said. "Sadly, concerns returned renewed urgency -- need fundamental reform UN budget virulently anti-Israel UN Human Rights Council -- Congress hope tenacious, principled partner future."
