Washington task forces focused Tripoli; Benghazi While there's sense air final battles begun, palpable anticipation seem translated type stepped-up bureaucratic activity one would expect. After meeting us nearly two hours Thursday, TNC Executive Committee chair (and PM equivalent) Mahmoud Jibril returned Doha rather head kind war room here.

Petraeuss unique political genius last decade provide two contrasting presidents military solution key national security problems tailored character. For Bush, obsessed Iraq leaving mark Middle East, Petraeus helped design grandiose, troop-heavy approach.

But approach, though cheaper resources American lives, still flawed. It still military answer problems deeply political nature rooted complex mix history, regional cultural particularism, effects protracted abuse power elites. By shifting drones special ops instruments choice combat militant extremism, U.S. government remains consumed old questions: How many men women uniform, equipped kind hardware, need employ tactics defeat enemy? What atrophied years two U.S. administrations dwelt obsessively questions tools U.S. foreign policy, including information-gathering analysis, diplomacy economic legal leverage. Perhaps gravest consequence knowledge deficit. Both wars hampered devastating lack situational understanding. In Afghanistan, I lived worked eight years, I stunned long took U.S. officials realize tribes key Afghan social structure. U.S. officials resisted meeting ordinary Afghans, dealing instead members self-serving unpopular government. So, decade, U.S. government operating almost blind.

Joseph McCarthy Washington. He asserted promotion proved Army "soft communism," launched investigation transfixed nation. Peress, way, mere dentist. He Susan Rice day. Rice, course, much substantial figure. She U.N. ambassador, friend Barack Obama's member Cabinet. Still, attack disproportionate accused done - it, exactly? - Peress case, conclude something work. At first, I thought witnessing another example Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) Rumpelstiltskin number - throwing fit stomping feet. It McCain first leveled solemn charge Rice lied Sunday TV shows attack U.S. consulate Benghazi, Libya. She characterized spontaneous riot was, fact, planned attack local al-Qaeda affiliate. But Rice hewing early line established intelligence community. If CIA others wrong - deceptive - so, inevitably, she. Just surely day follows night, McCain's broadside echoed Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). It soon taken 97 Republicans House found Rice unqualified become secretary state - post nominated. "Ambassador Rice widely viewed willfully incompetently misled American public," bellowed. I think Rice would make dandy secretary state. She's close president, matters great deal. But also seen overly political that, much version Benghazi, troubles others. Oddly enough, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), former presidential candidate another potential secretary state, seen much statesmen. He indeed independent foreign-policy thinker has, days old, restored prestige importance Foreign Relations Committee, chairman. But awful truth hardly matters Obama chooses.

That conclusion obvious. The "consulate" private residence taken purpose US city, It constructed US government building potentially hostile city. I met person worked I Benghazi June, told wasn't even clear consulate would retained first year It possibly temporary, depending Congressional funding. (The Tea Party House hasn't good meeting requests embassy security funds). The interesting question ad hoc arrangements made consulate Libyan revolution (the answer seems fairly obvious) is, responsible string assassinations acts violence city, RPG attack consulate September 11 one? Benghazi, population one million country 6.5 million, Libya's second largest city and1/1 e'as epicenter revolution government Muammar Qaddafi 2011. On November 22, Benghazi police chief Farej Darssi assassinated. In October police colonel barely avoided death— car wired explode, A Libyan intelligence officer killed September. A general assassinated August. Some figures worked Qaddafi defected revolution. Qaddafi's security forces responsible 1996 massacre hardline fundamentalists Abu Salim prison, making others disappear, Likely shadowy cells attacked US consulate behind attacks Benghazi police army officers. There may break case. Last Saturday, Benghazi security forces loyal elected government Tripoli, captured man suspected involved groups behind violence. And, appears willing spill beans. So let's call Libyan Deep Throat. Deep Throat knowledgeable conspiracies facing city dangerous hatching latter immediately attempted spring jail. On Sunday morning, militants attacked police facility next holding cell man detained. A policeman station died hail bullets attackers, called back-up. The police car sped scene ambushed three policemen killed. Still, police stood ground fought assault, kept valuable suspect custody, valuable testimony. Shortly midnight, Monday morning, small explosives set Garyounis police station Benghazi, damaging couple automobiles otherwise little damage. Then explosives set al-Uruba police station, also took sniper fire, neither resulted casualties.

Pis read following. I've followed case Torture homefront cries justice Comments <http://www.suntimes.com/news/marin/1734591,CST-EDT-caro126.article> August 26, 2009 BY CAROL MARIN <mailto:cmarin@suntimes.com> Sun-Times Columnist The feds can't -- yet -- deport Michigan restaurateur Ibrahim Parlak native Turkey. But frighteningly closer. And irony screams out. Carol Mann On Monday, day Eric Holder, President Obama's attorney general, announced would appoint special counsel investigate whether torture used CIA extract confessions foreign suspects, U.S. appeals court behest U.S. government ruled didn't problem sending Parlak back country tortured -- imprisoned 17 months, shocked electrodes, hung arms sexually violated. A Turkish Kurd, Parlak granted political asylum 1992. It government got cozier Turkey, re-classified Kurdish separatist movement "terrorist" attacks Sept. 11. With 9/11, Ibrahim Parlak's horror began anew. Suddenly looked different newly created Department Homeland Security Justice Department's Immigration courts. Instead seeing hard-working, tax-paying Chamber Commerce member ran Cafe Gulistan, small Middle Eastern restaurant resort town Harbert, Mich., tlie feds saw international menace. In 2004, FBI grabbed Parlak locked up. If hadn't volunteer team lawyers, including Reagan-appointed former U.S. attorney, former FBI anti- terrorism legal adviser bipartisan intervention Michigan's Sen. Carl Levin, liberal Democrat, Rep. Fred Upton, conservative Republican, Parlak would still jail. Thanks them, 47-year-old father 12-year-old girl temporarily free. But barely. The newest outrage 2-1 decision issued Cincinnati's 6th Circuit Court Appeals day Holder launched torture inquiry. B5 The majority opinion issued two Bush appointees put bench 9/11. Judge Julia Smith Gibbons Judge Jeffrey Sutton upheld Justice Department's Immigration courts ruling Parlak failed disclose relationship now-labeled terrorist organization even though never proven member. Let's remember something immigration courts. They independent. They work whoever attorney general. And past rulings Parlak came two now-controversial Bush appointees, John Ashcroft Alberto Gonzales. The fairness immigration rulings ripped none Judge Richard Posner 7th Circuit Court Appeals, one nation's brilliant judges. By September 2005, Posner noted "a staggering 40 percent 136 petitions" reversed due to, according one ruling, willingness ignore "the basic facts." Echoing Posner dissenting judge Parlak appeal. Judge Boyce F. Martin, Carter appointee, writes clarity conviction, arguing government's "awesome power used railroad man country." Like surgeon, Martin dissects Justice Department's immigration courts majority opinion colleagues, ends saying, "I remain hopeful, nevertheless, case sad remnant era paranoid, overzealous, error-riddled misguided anti-terrorism immigration enforcement gone wayside. It shame that, even hope proves true, late Ibrahim Parlak." Parlak's legal team appeal. Meanwhile, Holder, like Ashcroft Gonzales him, new boss immigration courts. As investigates questions U.S. torture abroad, here's hoping Holder examines ongoing domestic legal torture Ibrahim Parlak.

I making FM calls re Afghanistan going well memcons describe specific responses followup, especially Athens Brussels. Below memo concerned observer British feeling alienated us. /Let know think. Thx. Consensus across board Britain—center, right, left—is Atlantic alliance—the special relationship—the historic bond since World War II—is shattered. There dissenting voice, one, illusions. Opinion unanimous. The bottom line Obama administration's denigration UK seen summation Bush era. Undoubtedly, saw week Minister Defense Bob Ainsworth's public criticism Obama's indecision accusation president indifferent damaging British interest. While Downing Street sought ameliorate remarks oleaginous statement view simply everyone—everyone—thinks. His clumsy outburst classic gaffe—an embarrassing mistake reveals something true. The Chilcot inquiry Parliament, publicly conducting hearings origins UK involvement Iraq invasion, put Bush's war terror—and British involvement—on trial—and calmly conducted eviscerating hearings go another year. Blair seen either complicit basis knowing casus belli enthusiastically deceived tool. Nick Clegg, leader Liberal Democrats, stated reason support Afghanistan mission cratered lies told run-up Iraq war—another view universally held. Meanwhile, former UK ambassador US Christopher Meyer published new book history UK diplomacy concluding sections demise special relationship. He interviewed British media also appeared voluble witness Chi!cot commission. All British newspapers journals prominently published many pieces within last week decline fall US-UK relationship. Please see lead editorial today London Times cover story Spectator—two resolutely pro-American sources. The tone resentful, reserved, disdainful superior. The US administration considered blinkered, parochial counter-productive. Conservatives contemptuous Labour, feels abandoned somewhat baffled. Rather eager Obama's poodle, Cameron would superficially friendly privately scornful. Class lot contempt. A Cameron government would aristocratic even narrowly Etonian Conservative government recent history, sharply contrasting especially striving classless perspective grocer's daughter, Margaret Thatcher. And yet, recent poll week showed Labour within striking distance Tories, five points down, result slight economic uptick. A hung parliament seems possible. Given distribution voting patterns, Labour need win plurality seats Tories. The slight buoyancy Labour unique situation heightened anxiety Obama's Afghanistan process, excluded British government significant consultation consideration interests. See lead Con Coughlin's Spectator piece. Therefore, President might contemplate brief stop London going coming Oslo meeting Copenhage make public appearance Brown. And, others Administration pay special attention Brown secure strong support him, importantly, whole government British establishment reassured value stalwart support despite ups downs last eight years. Pasted Times editorial link Spectator article. From The Times November 26, 2009 Atlantic drift Washington's delay announcing Afghanistan strategy left Brown drifting. Obama needs invest time attention transatlantic alliance President Obama declared Tuesday "the whole world" responsibility help US-led mission Afghanistan. He would, said; soon lay "obligations international partners". Those partners waiting long time details. On Monday President tenth meeting advisers work strategy Afghanistan. He spent almost three months considering options, promised announcement deployments Thanksgiving holiday. For Gordon Brown, cannot come soon. After United States, Britain largest contributor troops Nato operation Afghanistan. There never suggestion Britain enough soldiers pursue separate strategy operate independently US forces, already number 68,000 troops. Until White House decides whether send extra 40,000 figure significantly lower number requested General Stanley McChrystal, Mr Brown cannot properly plan best support strategy. It becoming sadly apparent Britain left drifting delays Washington, Obama Administration largely unaware embarrassment causing Government. More worryingly, seem source concern within Administration. Downing Street, diplomatically, turns aside suggestion frustrated nonchalance treated. But insistent questions Afghanistan, anger caused steady stream returning war dead rapid crumbling public support war cannot answered effectively Mr Brown taken American confidence seen full partner Nato campaign. On surface, continuing high regard Britain dynamic articulate new President masked growling complaints. Mr Brown suffering, predecessor did, taint close association deeply unpopular US president. On contrary: like several European leaders, still eager position close possible Mr Obama clothe President's European popularity. But within Government, already worry Britain's voice counts far less past. This simply another instance persistent pointless British anxiety so-called special relationship; justified concern two main pillars Nato alliance policies strategies closely co-ordinated sympathetically understood sides fighting war. The fault, glaringly, American side. The White House longer seems monitoring reactions political options transatlantic allies. It sufficient suggest Administration sees little point investing time diplomacy British government likely defeated coming general election; wartime allies interests go far beyond political make-up government day. Mr Obama promised election campaign revive trust American leadership re-engage multinational diplomacy. In office, certainly voiced ideals; invested little giving new substance dynamism transatlantic relationship. On Afghanistan, Mr Brown sometimes left speechless Washington.

Haiti region's highest rate HIV/AIDS, highest rate maternal mortality, highest rate child mortality. But numbers HIV infections child maternal deaths coming down. Not long ago, Haiti endured three decades brutal dictatorship. But national presidential elections 2006 jump-started Haiti's democracy, President Preval Prime Minister Pierre Louis seeking maintain strong commitment democratic governance, take another step forward Sunday elections Senate. Like many nations, including United States, Haiti struggles crime, particularly global scourge drug trafficking. But reforms improve policing, strengthen justice system fight corruption underway, peacekeeping force led Brazil helped bring stability many Haitian communities. Haiti made strides help citizens many nations institutions represented today. And progress come government-to-government partnerships, also links among businesses, universities, NG0s, religious cultural groups, individuals-the full range resources relationships, heart smart power. That trajectory progress undermined combined winds hurricanes global economic recession. Haiti danger stalling. This conference gives us opportunity reignite path progress work team-with Haiti helm-to advance comprehensive, long-term strategy Haiti's growth, coordinating hemispheric international efforts, targeting clear goals, deploying diverse skills resources efficiently effectively. President Preval Prime Minister Pierre Louis identified help Haiti needs get back track. With priorities guide Haiti partner, make high-impact investments help lay foundation stronger democratic institutions, vibrant civil society, open market economy creates stability, attracts international investment, offers jobs wider economic opportunities Haiti region whole. Now time step investment Haiti-not situation dire, consequences inaction could lead significantly larger costs human financial terms road. With $100, pay year schooling one Haitian child immunize five. That's tiny fraction cost solving problems escalate time. The United States target support toward three areas Haitian government requested, aimed promoting conditions essential national regional progress. First, Haitian people need secure. They must able travel safely work school participate civic lives communities without fear violence. Second, country needs stronger infrastructure, particularly roads, circulatory system robust economy. Meanwhile, people Haiti ready work, jobs short supply. We accomplish two things putting people work building roads infrastructure throughout Haiti. And third, last year's hurricanes blew hole government's budget. Now Haiti facing huge deficit, make harder provide services short-term fund major projects long-term. Their debt obligations constrain ability lay groundwork future. On issues-security, jobs infrastructure, debt relief-the United States lending assistance seeking partner nations maximize collective impact. First, security. Effective international partnerships already helped stem violence improve security Haiti. Cite Soleil, example, no-man's-land years, today, violence subsided new sense freedom felt streets. The Haitian National Police supported work UN peacekeeping operation Haiti, first hemisphere Latin American Caribbean nations participated. Brazil led mission determination skill. This level engagement collaboration major step forward region. But criminal networks operating Haiti eliminated. Haiti continues fight drug traffickers made country distribution point illegal drugs headed United States, Canada Europe. Drug trafficking problem involves many nations, role play ending deadly trade. That includes United States. We give $2 million fight drug trafficking Haiti Merida Initiative, plan conceived Mexico, Central America United States. This money fund secure communications network Haitian police; provide maritime base, vehicles operational support police drug units; provide training promote cross-border cooperation Haiti Dominican Republic; sharpen investigation prosecution drug crimes. Once security established, opportunity take root. Nations Canada Spain Japan offered generous assistance help repair damage last year's storms. Now time take next step-to move beyond peacekeeping disaster relief long-term reconstruction development. Haiti highest unemployment rate hemisphere; 70 percent people don't jobs. It also one region's highest population growth rates. Together, trends created one development expert called "youth tsunami"-nearly 1 million youths expected come job market next five years. To spur creation jobs, United States passed HOPE Act 2006, give garments made Haiti tariff-free access U.S. market. Last October, extended trade preference another decade. Apparel one largest sectors Haiti's economy. We see great potential job creation field, gratified Brazil's interest supporting Haitian apparel industry well. But build diversified economy, Haiti needs trade deals. It also needs infrastructure support flow goods services. The roads Haiti beyond inadequate; many communities isolated lack passable road, prevents people holding jobs, children going school, farmers bringing crops market. Better roads could facilitate greater trade bring Haitians global economy. Haiti also needs better roads tourist areas, promote sector economy. Other urgent infrastructure needs include digging water catchments prevent floods, completing garment workers' training center, creating canals help irrigation. As part $287 million non-emergency assistance provide Haiti year, authorized $20 million aid generate jobs, help people put skills work building country's future. We look forward working Haiti distribute money quickly effectively, trigger virtuous circle long-term economic growth. All fiscal responsibility world can't prevent natural disaster. The hurricanes didn't wash away crops houses; also washed away months government planning future. Haiti facing approximately $50 million budget deficit, could undermine Haiti's long-term ambitions well services people depend survive. The United States provide $20 million pay Haiti's upcoming debt service obligations, free Haiti use resources fill budget gap. [There fourth urgent need United States committed helping Haiti resolve. The combined effect rising food prices globally destruction crops hurricanes exposed millions Haitians malnutrition destructive effects health productivity. Malnourished people often weak work; chronically hungry children struggle learn school. Food insecurity source suffering, direct threat economic growth global stability. The United States provide $15-million in-kind contribution food help Haiti continues rebuild. ] These ways United States ready partner Haiti nations. But additional pieces larger mission need support-from helping Haiti adapt climate change future hurricanes won't claim thousands lives; strengthening health systems; promoting sustainable agriculture; developing civil society. This work matter governments, also mission people. Here U.S., I heard many individuals groups care Haiti want help develop don't know invest time money way make real impact. We think creatively helping people outside government get involved meaningful way Haiti's future. Our people valuable resource, potential help places like Haiti yet tapped. We know empirical data small investments go long way. This something I've seen visits Haiti. I traveled husband shortly wedding, years later First Lady.

They surprised see strangers -- five women two men -- sitting chairs boys typically occupy. The students find empty seats shrug matching brown coats mismatched scarves. They curious visitors lean-back, fold-your-arms, prove-it kind way. "I'm James Forman," begins 40-something man.

The Oak Hill students, African American, dressed identically khaki pants royal-blue polo shirts. They chosen seats edges room and, sitting down, pushed chairs back far possible wall. Forman's Georgetown law students -- African American, Arab, Latino, Caucasian -- jeans sweaters. They lean forward, intent maybe little bit nervous. "I teach class juvenile justice law school," Forman continues. "And I thought would really good way law students learn juvenile justice. There certain amount learn reading, also need see experience things. So I thought would learn lot coming hearing experiences." Carleto raises eyebrow. This new one. "And benefit know things law don't. Ya'll certain things know. They certain things know. It learning opportunity everybody." Forman suggests go around room share names interesting fact themselves. Dead silence. He smiles encouragingly. "My name James Forman, I helped start organization, See Forever, runs school," says.

"My name's Carleto Bailey," says. "My interesting fact I'm funny./I He gives wide smile bright white teeth. The Georgetown students laugh. Oak Hill student Ashawntea Henderson, 17, sits next him, rolls eyes. But Carleto's done: "And I'm smart." But turns out, Georgetown folks -- like teachers Oak Hill Academy -- aren't going accept Carleto's assertion face value. They want good grades, right answers multiple-choice test. They want prove think. Forman shows group excerpt film juveniles incarcerated New York's Rikers Island. Afterward, law students want know whether label makes difference. It's hard question. "Inmates? Residents? Scholars?" one asks. "Does matter you're called?" Carleto studies woman's face discern wants hear back. It blank. He struggles. "Not much," says, finally. He looks her. She seems unconvinced. He worries given wrong answer tries again. "Back community, certain [police] patrols neighborhood say, 'I know you're to.' When come home, us trying right, basically criticize us you're already labeled." "What labels?" Forman asks. This one easy Carleto. He sinks chair throws out. "Trouble," says. *** Carleto Bailey trouble. He also, rightly noted, smart. But arrived Oak Hill Academy disadvantages: He poorly educated D.C. public schools, frequently truant multiple run-ins law. The D.C. Department Youth Rehabilitation Services, runs Oak Hill, won't release information specific crime landed Carleto still juvenile, know Carleto's second time detention center. His academic knowledge spotty best. He tell James Forman is, comma falls letter's greeting. ("Dear, Fidel" writes mock letter Castro English class.) He fairly typical Oak Hill "scholar." And, upon time, would written But today, staff fledgling Oak Hill Academy determined view kids' captive time window opportunity fill gaping holes education. Part reform initiative Vincent Schiraldi, director Youth Rehabilitation Services, school opened doors last year takes unique approach teaching delinquent youth. What would happen, Oak Hill Academy co-founders Forman David Domenici wondered, seduced kids content meaningful them? What would happen lots good, caring teachers small classrooms? What one assumed kids could learn -- behaved such? In words, would happen District's challenged students got private school education, albeit campus decidedly different nature? "The bottom line," says Domenici, "is kids risk need highest quality programming, they've gotten worst." It conviction drove Domenici, also school's principal, Forman create three public charter schools underprivileged troubled students District past 11 years. Called Maya Angelou schools, two high schools middle school attack educational deficiencies angles. Students attend small classes taught specially trained staff. The high school day stretches 9 a.m. 6 p.m., three meals provided. Some kids, whose home lives prove chaotic study, offered supervised housing neighborhood. And works. Last year, 93 percent Maya Angelou graduates accepted two- four-year colleges, Domenici says. (According District's Office State Superintendent Education, 29 percent students enter ninth grade D.C. public schools city charter schools enroll postsecondary educational programs within 18 months graduating high school.) It good model. But even though Domenici Forman used teaching court-involved youth -- 40 percent Maya Angelou students spent time Oak Hill -- working inside gates posed new set challenges. Youth Rehabilitation Services court monitor 23 years due part history abuse poor conditions. When Schiraldi took department 2005 began reform efforts implementing less punitive therapeutic detention model Oak Hill, saw immediately changing school essential. "How could I look staff Oak Hill say excellence kids sitting school total waste time 9 3 every day?" Schiraldi says. Kids sat watched movies day. Little, teaching going on, Schiraldi says. "It miserable, miserable school." Schiraldi immediately began lobbying D.C. Board Education hard hire someone new operate school, soon got okay, put request proposals. Domenici Forman submitted plan Schiraldi says "blew ones water," 2007 awarded $12 million contract run school next three years. Domenici's Forman's partnership somewhat unlikely one. Domenici son former New Mexico Republican senator Pete Domenici. He went Stanford Law School, worked corporate law years gave teach work teen delinquents. Forman grandson Jessica Mitford, daughter British baron celebrated civil rights activist journalist. Forman, graduated Yale Law School, worked law clerk Justice Sandra Day O'Connor D.C. public defender. After seeing good schooling options teenage clients had, joined forces Domenici, met mutual friend, start independent school 20 students 1997. A year later, became part first Maya Angelou public charter school. At Oak Hill Academy, principal Domenici fights occasionally maddening bureaucracy basics: functioning boilers, permission college tour group six students, classes uninterrupted corrections staff sometimes call three-quarters students middle class take meds. Forman chairman Maya Angelou Public Charter School Board Directors board member parent group, See Forever Foundation. He attacks hurdles side, fundraising advocating juvenile justice reform. "When David came run school here, like "Ocean's 12": Go find people trust previous mission," Forman jokes. That included past colleagues even Maya Angelou graduates. Samantha Crandal Simpore, then-coed Oak Hill 15 accessory assault charge, went Maya Angelou school runs Oak Hill Academy welcome center. "I tell them, I here, too," Simpore says. She tells new student 17 years old didn't know multiplication tables, rode bus school day hooked Walkman, hoping one knew listening recitation times tables. "I say: 'You're intersection life. You know what's street behind you. Nothing that. But choice what's road ahead.'" Many 90 Oak Hill students, ranging age 14 19, come performing way grade level, nearly half diagnosed learning disabilities. They Oak Hill average 10 months, cycling schedule nothing nine-month academic year. Out necessity, grouped according cell blocks live keep opposing gangs separate. Thirteen-year-olds classes 18-year-olds. More half committed Oak Hill violent felonies. Fights common. (Before month out, Carleto get fistfight hallway delay release date.) Through use small classes -- typically five 14 teens work one teacher, teaching assistant guard -- school organizes curriculum around four-week themes designed pique students' curiosity get think critically nature democracy, social justiCe role world. For example, Relationship theme, students parse types relationships ranging humans natural world (ancient river civilizations) individuals groups (Pharaohs subjects) humans ideas (liberation theology). At time, English class, students working standard five-paragraph essay via guiding question: "Why relationships matter, relationships good bad people?" With current unit, Change, D.C. public school system's learning standards woven social studies curriculum loose headings "Changes Way Humans Think About World Their Place It," becomes way introducing scientific revolution, Enlightenment Magna Carta. It's philosophy emphasizes learning making cross-discipline connections long popular affluent, progressive schools typically eschewed schools underprivileged kids, rote learning return basics often rule. Oak Hill Academy also created course called Advocacy, Georgetown law students co- teaching, emphasizing month's theme. Domenici believes learning law works democracy "is essential teaching good citizens." "We always believed one roles help kids self-advocate advocate behalf community," Domenici says. "We think good skill students individually also one democracy demands." But ambitious agenda, Oak Hill Academy faces significant obstacles. Can teach teens think critically they're missing basic underpinnings education? How teach empowerment setting demands rigid compliance keep kids misbehaving? Although sometimes grows discouraged, Domenici best buoy staff members learn one promising students got fight unit "graduated" program commit another crime sent back. "I talk staff fact that, day day, job absolute best work domain within control," says, reminding don't control pieces puzzle. "And well, done moral thing." His staff members must keep faith straddling two equally potent realities: First, knowledge power, possessing it, every student capable success. And, absent right support, failure lurks right around corner. It sounds like this: "I think Carleto good chance finishing high school going college," Domenici says. Pause. "Also, highly risk that." *** It cold day late January, Oak Hill midst four-week session change. Dressed jeans, blue shirt gray corduroy jacket (the heat's working), Oak Hill social studies teacher John Adams paces around room stops bend Carleto, doodling piece paper desk. "Pay attention," says, taking Carleto's pencil. "Carleto, today's essential question?" "What historical change, different kinds change?" Carleto says, reading board Adams scrawled topic. "Yes," Adams says. He ignores student wandering around room aimlessly, student snatches hat classmate tosses toward hallway. A youth development specialist, corrections guards referred Schiraldi, appears deeply engrossed magazine back room. But snatches hat mid-air, scowls disruptive student tucks hat pocket. "Please sit," Adams tells student. Not quite sitting, quite standing, student perches edge Adams's desk. Good enough. Adams continues: "What's difference personal change historical change?" Silence. "Anybody? More silence. "Ashawntea?" "Historical change like revolution," Ashawntea says. Adams throws list changes -- getting raise salary, moving new house, election President Obama -- Carleto accurately sorts changes micro macro, personal historical. "Obama's campaign change," Adams says. "Do think talking historical change?" He wants students think president, office two days. What might first 100 days look like? asks students. "What advice would offer him?" Carleto looks stumped. "Just throw ideas," Adams prompts. He tells students going craft letters president, advising set agenda change. Carleto slaps pencil desk. "Obama's reading letters," says. He folds arms across chest, skeptical president lay eyes letter -- skeptical, perhaps, teachers really want hear ideas. *** Later, Carleto acknowledge knows quite bit president, reading Barack Obama's "Dreams From My Father." "It started good book, got excellent," says. He struggles hard articulate book's themes appeal. "I don't know put it," says finally, "but growing -- disrespect, -- Caucasian mom African father, still made through." Sitting guard's room gym February evening, echoing sound classmates bouncing basketballs around cavernous gym, Carleto goes tell possibly apocryphal story. "As child, fun, happy -- far kindergarten sixth grade. Starting first grade, honor roll also making school every day," says, beginning third person, quickly lapsing first. "In late stages middle school; end eighth grade, I started smoking weed, stuff I wasn't supposed doing." He takes full responsibility. "No one peer-pressured anything. I liking going I high," explains. He, like almost teens Oak Hill, denies involved gang. Still, Carleto says best friend since elementary school killed 10th grade "a neighborhood thing." "Nowadays, anyone ride you, mistaken someone else shot," says, explaining buddy shot "miscommunication." "It wasn't intended us," says, insisting friend, nicknamed "Smoke," waiting bus. Then announces, "I don't want talk it." So doesn't, though clearly haunts him: He doodle "R.I.P. Smoke" cover blue folder piece loose-leaf paper comer chalkboard. He's happy talk Oak Hill Academy though, 3.5 grade-point average six months. (Domenici says Carleto top 25 percent students Oak Hill tests fairly high assessments.) Carleto likes school even though bit easy him, senior freshman. He complains classes short guards always interrupting move class getting warmed up. That really bugs him, doesn't say much. He says leaving Oak Hill two months intends finish schooling Oak Hill's transition center District, says graduate June. When gets out, couple things wants right off, says. First, intends see girlfriend, go restaurant go "the Adidas shop Georgetown, mom get stuff-- dad, too." He says mom pretty upset got arrested sent Oak Hill. "She was. . . I'm going say kind like surprised actions, I done," Carleto says. "You know say 'Whatever hides dark, comes out?'. . . She ashamed me, disappointed me." Meanwhile, makes long, 45-minute trek District Laurel visit. "Every weekend, days!" says. He alternately vague specific describes family life. He four brothers -- ages 27, 23, 16 11 -- reports two younger brothers live mom. He says mom works secretary, struggles remember where. "She working with, what's program downtown Washington Monument, dealing Smokey Bear?. . . I'm trying think. It's right Holocaust Museum. It's brick building. She works there." Later, Carleto's school case worker, Essence Jones, offer somewhat different account Carleto's life. Although Carleto 12th grade, graduate June says. He still six credits shy, Jones says. And least three months -- two -- release. Carleto's father part life, Jones says. The teenager living aunt coming Oak Hill. His mother, rap sheet dating 1982, jail years, arrested repeatedly string felonies misdemeanors, including possession distribution drugs, well prostitution. She prison since 2005, serving three consecutive sentences totaling seven years assault dangerous weapon, attempted distribution cocaine violation bail. She visiting Carleto weekends. *** By end February, still midst unit change, Oak Hill teens file advocacy class, jostling other, edgy. It unseasonably warm outside, want here. Reluctantly take seats, Carleto positions see patch brown grass mud prison yard, visible door someone wedged open. Occasionally, breeze wafts room. Today, law students decide tackle topic disproportionate minority confinement. If youths color 35 percent general population United States, 62 percent prison population, disproportionate minority confinement, law students explain. They refer teens handout desk front him, article excerpt New American Media, "Racism Juvenile Justice System Revealed," explain isn't simply people color commit crimes: "African-American youths 4.5 times likely, Latinos 2.3 times likely, white youths detained identical offenses. About half white teenagers arrested drug charge go home without formally charged drawn system. Only one-quarter black teens arrested drug charges catch similar break." Although youth color 100 percent Oak Hill's population inmates and, indeed, 100 percent 721 juvenile delinquents currently committed Youth Rehabilitation Services care settings across city, disproportionate minority confinement hard concept teens grasp. Georgetown student Abby Fee tries pie graph, bar graph, sketch disproportionate Xs Os. Blank stares. Then slowly dawns Ashawntea they're talking about. "Hey," says, suddenly sitting forward. "They're switched around! Basically, there's us juveniles prison white juveniles -- even though there's them." "Yes," Fee says. "So population outside system looks lot different inside system." Ashavvntea sits back chair mull over. Fee law students move teens statistics speculative discussion reasons behind figures. They prepared role-playing game coax teens thinking different perspectives. Then, want students practice advocating change. "So, we're going three roles," Fee says, dividing teens pairs. "One group 15-year-old; one group playing math teacher; one group playing city council member." Carleto partner learn play city council member preparing presentation reforming police department. Carleto doesn't want city council member. He doesn't even want today. He wraps unwraps pencil bottom T-shirt. He puts glasses on, takes off. "How could maintain better relationships" police? Fee asks, settling chair help Carleto partner work this. Carleto throws pencil table. Won't answer. She asks again. Silence. Finally, offers sullen challenge. "Stop harassing people reason?" "How want treat people?" "Equally," says. He picks pencil tap, tat, taps desk. Fee tries get specific. "Don't arrest small problems. Instead, take home, tell family you're doing," Carleto's partner says, unconsciously slipping second person. "And think help crime stopped decreased general?" Fee prods. A long pause. Could minds whirring busily; could they're spacing out. Fee, teacher enrolling Georgetown, takes stride. She taps paper couple times repeats question. "Don't 10 15 cars patrolling area barely see police car," Carleto says. "Patrol ward equally?" asks Fee. Carleto writes down, adds: "I see lot cruel things done ain't right." Fee nods, encourages write down. Carleto's partner grabs pencil speaks writes. "The majority police shouldn't carry guns. I could say, 'The majority police racist.'" "But would fix that?" Fee. prods. "A camera car catch they're -- secret one," Carleto suggests. He sits straighter chair. "And don't pull people they're black. They say anything, that's reason I pulled over, headlights whatever." Suddenly, Carleto roll, rattles list improvements. "Call order city council," says Georgetown student Dania Ayoubi. Carleto partner stand front class. "Hello, I'm Mr. Jones, I city councilman," Carleto says, glancing paper twisting tail shirt free hand. "We complaints different communities wards police, suggestions cracking officers." He sounds nervous begins list. "Stop harassing minorities ethnic youths, treat equal race are. Also, police don't arrest situation school like fight anything. I feel arrested taken home. Then tell parents happened reason stopped police." He moves briskly suggestions twice, tentatively, tries actually making eye contact audience. In conclusion, says, "verbally abusing" youth won't tolerated more. "Basically, want crack officers removed, so." Another pair students rises begin presentation, teens interrupted crackle guard's walkie-talkie. "Time go!" guard announces. The law students surprised -- quite done -- politely acquiesce. "Wait!" Ashawntea says, standing up. "We got 10 minutes." "It take five minutes get stuff together get coats on," guard says. "But 10 minutes!" Carleto insists. He Ashawntea sit back fold arms. "It's 2:20. We got 10 minutes still." The guard takes beat, shrugs concedes Carleto's point. He goes back hall wait. Carleto shoots Ashawntea look surprise. His advocacy worked. "Yesss!" Ashawntea hisses breath.

April 25, 2009 Clinton, Iraq, Blames 'Rejectionists' Violence By MARK LANDLER BAGHDAD — Secretary State Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived Saturday morning one-day visit, delivering American show support Iraq battles sudden eruption violence, wake suicide bombings killed least 140 people wounded several hundred Thursday Friday. Mrs. Clinton, first visit Baghdad secretary state, acknowledged attacks worrisome. She said would seek briefing security situation American military commander, Gen. Ray Odierno, first meeting Saturday, day packed appointments. But played suggestions attacks augured return relentless sectarian violence convulsed Iraq 2006. She said signal new jihadist movement taking root Iraq, could derail progress country made last two years. "In Iraq, always political conflicts," Mrs. Clinton said reporters setting unannounced visit Friday evening. "But I really believe Iraq, whole, right track." She characterized latest bout violence last gasp "rejectionists" fear government succeed creating united peaceful Iraq. The suicide bombings, said, "in unfortunately tragic way, signal rejectionists fear Iraq going right direction." "Are going bad days? Yes, are," Mrs. Clinton said. But added, "If look evidence, overwhelmingly progress that's made positive." The Obama administration, said, determined help Iraq achieve "stability, sovereignty, self-reliance," United States prepares pull last troops end 2011. Mrs. Clinton regular visitor here, coming three times senator chart progress war voted authorize, later said mismanaged Bush administration. She said pleased back, though attacks cast shadow visit. While violence far worst levels 2006, 18 major attacks month kindled fears Baathist jihadist elements could reconstituting smaller, still deadly, insurgency exploit withdrawal American troops 2011. Mrs. Clinton compared latest suicide bombings spectacular terrorist attack occurred several months Good Friday peace accord ended years conflict Northern Ireland. At times, analysis almost echoed former Vice President Dick Cheney former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. When sectarian violence relentless several years ago, Mr. Cheney spoke insurgency "last throes," Mr. Rumsfeld talked "dead-enders" kept fighting lost cause. On Friday, Gen. David Petraeus, head military's Central Command, testified House appropriations committee suicide bombers may part militant network based Tunisia. Four bombers, said, Tunisia. Mrs. Clinton said specific information bombers, said: "We've seen suicide bombers many countries Iraq last six years. It's unfortunate young men, occasionally even young woman, would travel Iraq kill people way." 41 The violence seem curtail Mrs. Clinton's ambitions brief visit. In addition General Odierno, scheduled meet retinue Iraqi leaders, including president, Jalal Talabani; prime minister, Nuni Kamal al- Maliki; foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari. She also playing host roundtable Iraqi women, something done previous trips Iraq. And hold town-hall meeting Iraqi students, well members nongovernmental organizations provincial reconstruction teams. This format Mrs. Clinton savored presidential candidate, that, secretary state, used South Korea Turkey. "I want listen," said, "I want respond questions concerns. I want feedback ideas going make transition successful possible." When President Obama visited Baghdad earlier month, dusty skies prevented traveling helicopter Baghdad International Airport city. He met Mr. Maliki palace near airport General Odierno American base, Camp Victory. The new American ambassador, Christopher R. Hill, beat Mrs. Clinton Baghdad one day. He confirmed Senate Tuesday lengthy process held Republican senators, objected lack experience Arab world handling negotiations North Korea nuclear weapons program. In Iraq, Mr. Hill spearhead shift emphasis United States military civilian operations. Some Iraq experts said American civilian presence lacking momentum since departure February last United States ambassador, Ryan C. Crocker.
Clinton says Iraq right track BAGHDAD (AP) - U.S. Secretary State Hillary Rodham Clinton says week's deadly suicide bombings Iraq sign extremists fear Iraqi government succeeding. On first visit Iraq America's top diplomat, Clinton said country made tremendous strides despite recent violence continues deserve support Obama administration moves reduce U.S. military presence there. Clinton arrived Baghdad Saturday unannounced trip suicide bombings capital outside killed least 148 people Thursday Friday. The attacks exposed gaps security Iraq takes U.S. forces protecting country.

(New poll Guardian shows widespread disaffection parties result Commons expenses scandal; 27 percent voting fringe parties.) Gordon attempt overwhelm news coverage loss cabinet reshuffle, early next day, June 5. The plot (sounds like Tudors): David target, multiple angles motives, personal ambition mixed anti-Blairism. Peter always wanted Foreign Secretary, job held grandfather, Herbert Morrison. (Morrison also deputy PM, doesn't Peter want that?) New Labour people regard Peter ambitious New Labour point. He supported Gordon's utterly misbegotten wildly unpopular proposal raise top tax rate 50 percent. The fallout less resentment affluent paying grudging understanding need new revenues sense Labour Gordon abandoning project social aspiration opportunity heart New Labour message. Ed Balls, one Gordon's closest longtime advisers, also determined topple David. Balls contemporary David's, wants leader party himself, continues Gordon v. Tony bitter rivalry future. Balls currently Minister Children Schools linked Damian McBride (Gordon's hatchetman, trashed Blairites, got caught blogging scheme smear Cameron). If Gordon names Peter David's job, Balls would take Peter's become Business Secretary. David would pushed Home Secretary. Once Balls takes Peter's job, Balls likely reverse Peter's privatization proposal Royal Mail win support party's left-wing base, beginning campaign David post-Gordon leadership struggle. Tony sees situation terminal. Hope speak soon. He trying become President Europe Lisbon treaty passes.

Barack Obama may support insurance mandate By CARRIE BUDOFF BROWN I 6/3/09 3:42 PM EDT Updated: 6/3/09 11:22 PM EDT As presidential candidate, Barack Obama scoffed Hillary Rodham Clinton's proposal require people buy health insurance. "(If) can't afford it, don't get it," Obama said primary, arguing mandate would work unless insurance costs lowered first. For first time, Obama confirmed Wednesday plans stake different position president. In letter two leading Democratic senators, Obama said could support mandate individuals buy coverage, long Congress exempted could afford it. This marks shift stance campaign, tussled repeatedly Clinton issue. She proposed individual mandate, not. "I share goal ending lapses gaps coverage make us less healthy drive everyone's costs, I open ideas shared responsibility," Obama wrote. "But I believe going make people responsible owning health insurance, must make health care affordable." "If end system people responsible insurance, need provide hardship waiver exempt Americans cannot afford it," Obama wrote. Detailing positions various health care proposals first time president, Obama also said Americans able choose public private insurance plans reformed health care system. "I strongly believe Americans choice public health insurance option operating alongside private plans," wrote. "This give better range choices, make health care market competitive, keep insurance companies honest." He offered qualified support mandate employers provide insurance pay fee government. Employers "have responsibility support health insurance employees," Obama wrote, small businesses exempt. Obama's positions issues entirely surprising, decision weigh congressional Democratic leaders released single bill unexpected. Prior letter, Obama aides declined say specifically stood various issues, including public plan individual mandate, saying wanted Congress lead way writing bill. But Democrats anxious president take public stance, letter provides guidance many Congress craving House Senate committees move closer releasing draft bills. "The president says get done. Get done right get one chance," said Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), member Senate Health, Education, Labor Pensions Committee. "The letter essentially synthesizes president saying." He outlined parameters letter Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) Health, Education, Labor Pensions Committee Chairman Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.). Obama's endorsement public insurance option could boost controversial proposal serve catalyst Democratic base president kicks grassroots campaign Saturday. "It's clear Republican resistance public plan hasn't softened President Obama's support one," Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said statement. "This strengthens hand us advocating public option, way keep private insurers' feet fire." Despite almost uniform opposition Republicans public plan, president wrote letter remains "hopeful many Republicans" would back overhaul bill. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), ranking Republican Finance Committee, struck optimistic tone statement, saying letter "doesn't draw lines sand," "is helpful statements reform legislation needs bipartisan support." However, letter likely incite opponents, frustrated Obama's lack specifics. Indeed, Thursday morning, Conservatives Patients' Rights begin airing new TV ad called "Bulldozer," says "government-run plan" drive private insurers business eliminate consumer choices.

Sorry flood email, I couldn't resist sending Ben Smith A year later, Hillary wins A year ago today, final set primaries made official foregone conclusion Barack Obama won primary, Hillary Clinton lost it. There's far much going today dwell anniversary, seem worth noting one particular piece news light: On central health care policy debate Democratic Primary -- was, fair, conducted within fairly narrow frame -- Obama appears conceded today Senate plan likely closely resemble Clinton's. In dense, careful letter Ted Kennedy Max Baucus, Obama offered principles health care plan conceded central point: He open individual mandate, campaigned against, talked Senators parties buzzword "shared responsibility." Obama still backs "hardship waiver" people unable afford mandate -- consistent core objection mandate. But cast principled difference approach -- problem merely people couldn't afford insurance? something more? -- seems conceded. Here's relevant paragraph: I understand Committees moving towards principle shared responsibility -- making every American responsible health insurance coverage, asking employers share cost. I share goal ending lapses gaps coverage make us less healthy drive everyone's costs, I open ideas shared responsibility. But I believe going make people responsible owning health insurance, must make health care affordable. If end system people responsible insurance, need provide hardship waiver exempt Americans cannot afford it. In addition, I believe employers responsibility support health insurance employees, small businesses face number special challenges affording health benefits exempted. B6 B6 By Ben Smith 07:51 PM

The Parliamentary Labour Party meeting Over. Gordon survived. The event, held private, high drama anticlimax once. The chair asked rebels come forward speak. Only one prominent person emerged, Charles Clarke, former Home Secretary Blairite; rest handful half-dozen backbenchers. Their remarks Brown bringing party poorly received. The party, all, mood breaking ranks rewarding disloyalty. With paltry showing, opposition petered out, least now. Gordon gave speech, strong analysis, discussing government paying price getting country difficult recession, suffering worst parliamentary crisis since Lloyd George still program offer. He also make point party split int past ideology policy stated differences presented opposition. So now, Gordon won. Sid An Excellent Credit Score 750. See Yours Just 2 Easy Steps!

FYI, Gary Sick's latest analysis Iran (posted blog). Sick independent sources well informed. June 17, 2009 Is another Iranian revolution? To someone watched studied Iranian revolution 1979 fascination, developments Iran today eerie reminiscence. Then massive protests filled streets, often marching dignified ominous silence; bloodshed nervous security men guns faced determined unarmed crowds; sullen mourning parades;20there catchy chants ritual calls "Down shah!"; night rooftops rang shouts allahu akbar. You need change "shah" "dictator," description happening Iran today. But one big difference. Thirty years ago, Iran charismatic cleric named Ayatollah Khomeini refined sense strategy willingness risk everything cause represented. On side Mohammed Reza Shah, throne 37 years commanded one powerful military security regimes world. On surface appeared uneven battle — guns turbans — ruler guns wavered turbans grew size confidence old order collapsed. Today nominal leader opposition forces reformed radical, Mir Hossein Mousavi, notably lacking personal charisma. On side constitutional Leader, Ayatollah IChamene' i, widely perceived cautious political animal limited qualifications religious post compensates lack charisma manipulation political system institutions loyal — particularly politically minded clergy powerful security forces, including Revolutionary Guards. Neither men seems fully control forces, let alone situation. The fraudulent election defeat Mousavi triggering event, energy behind unprecedented demonstrations due sense outrage betrayal gross manipulation numbers regime undying devotion Mousavi. Yesterday Mousavi ordered people stay home face conflicting pro-regime demonstration. They marched anyway (and daughter former president Rafsanjani joined urged on). Mousavi "ordered" everyone march following day (which probably going without orders). IChamene'i announced "divine assessment" election outcome — even would probably physically possible count 40 million ballots. Then, face mass protests, ordered investigation results Guardian Council— organization responsible managing election first place. No one believed either case, one expected anything importance Guardian Council. Khamene'i ordered peace reconciliation. No one paid attention. I deliberately mention president-elect Ahmadinejad. After celebrating "victory," went largely symbolic meeting Moscow. He seems decision loop passive player major actor events. So calling shots? Mousavi seems running along crowd, leading it. But probably required keep protest motion. On side, little evidence suggests important decisions made ultra-conservative leadership Revolutionary Guards, whose political role ballooned past decade, perhaps cooperation extremist counterparts clergy. They utterly ruthless ideologically fueled. New York Times columnist Nick Kristoff reminded us several days ago (see blog item June 15 below) end day, I saw Tiananmen 20 years ago, Might Right battle, it's often prudent bet Might, least short run. The regime seems miscalculated badly. They seemed believe sudden coup — announcement dramatic election results followed show force — would intimidate silence opposition consolidate control. That perhaps understandable decisions made military leaders tend see battle Manichaean terms, rather politicians IChamene'i accustomed seeing shades gray. In event, b ackfired much larger crisis hands simply arranged Ahmadinejad win slim margin (which least believable). All parties uncharted territory. A significant portion Iranian population seems concluded social contract rulers — accepting Islamic rule return respectful regard opinion governed, Islamic Republic — longer valid. They trust rulers. The rulers, whose support declining years face inept management country, increasingly replacing popular support repression. This election seems called tactic question. For military, obvious answer repression. So would appear moment bet Might. But nobody fully command events. Decisions taken next weeks fateful could determine future path Iranian revolution. There another lesson Iran's leaders contemplate Tiananmen moment. When Tiananmen crackdown occurred almost exactly ten years ago, one leaders China time Zhao Ziyang, General Secretary Communist Party. He later fired placed house arrest. His smuggled memoirs appeared, revealing depth disagreements within lea dership proceed.

Thursday, June 18, 2009 Day Mourning, Protests, Called Mousavi Thursday Mir-Hosain Mousavi, maintains won last Friday's presidential election despite official assertions lost 2 1 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, calling another rally Thursday, time part honor persons killed hardliners security forces course previous demonstrations. Mourning martyr central Iranian Shiite religious culture strains medieval Catholicism Europe, Mousavi's camp tapping powerful set images myths here. The archetypal Shiite martyr Imam Husayn, grandson Prophet Muhammad, championed oppressed Muslims Iraq cut Umayyad Muslim Empire. Redognition Muslim state might commit ultimate sacrilege beheading person dangled Prophet's knee imbued modern political Shiism distrust state. When Husayn's head brought Umayyad caliph Yazid deposited throne, older companions Prophet said wept remarked, "I saw Prophet's lips cheeks." Shiites ritually march, flagellate, chant honor martyred Imam divinely-appointed leader. Today's protesters wearing green, symbolizes Mousavi's descent Prophet Muhammad. (Mousavi's family name refers Seventh Imam (descendant Prophet claims divine knowledge), Musa Kazim, whose tomb Kazimiya, north Baghdad. Sayyid families, claiming descent Prophet, often take one Imams' names family name honor them, though course also claiming descent previous Imams right back Prophet.) The repertoires protest reformists using echo 1978-79 Islamic Revolution-- chanting "God Great," mourning pious fallen martyrs, etc.-- another sign movement alienated secularized elites. But Mousavi's supporters also sporting black ribbons indicate mourning fallen. Typically, dead commemorated one month 40 days. In 1978 demonstrations killed previous demonstrations grew size year, till reached alleged million streets Tehran. Since reformists already claiming Monday's rally million, wonder things go here. The regime's attempt paint protesters nothing US intelligence agents underlines wise President Obama insert forcefully situation Iran. The reformers hard liners stable groupings. The core competing allegiance general Iranian public. If reformers convince Iranians justice cause, swing behind opposition. If hard liners convince public reformers nothing cat's paws grasping, imperialist West-- i.e. Ahmad Chalabis trying bring Iran foreign occupation get power themselves-- reformists crushed. Iranians value national independence all, suffered CIA-installed goverment decades mid-twentieth century. The prescriptions John McCain Faux Cable news muscular US diplomacy point tone deaf Iranian realities would backfire big time, harming reform cause US interests. Anyway, basket case US Republican Party reduced Iraq, one global South likely want meddling internal affairs. Reports streaming arrest hundred opposition figures hard line militia men following protesters home breaking homes terrorize them. See e.g., Basij paramilitary forces terrorize residential complex. The Basij militiamen said afraid come numbers opposition demonstrations, sneak around night trail protesters harass arrest them.

He portrayed massive post-election demonstrations charges ballot fraud minor tiff. Gary Sick wonders Khamenei really supreme leader more, hints hard line tack stealing election directed Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, country's religious national guard.

I spoke morning Gary Sick, who, recall, senior person NSC Iran hostage crisis, Columbia. He one best intelligence networks Iran, 1,500 people, experts extensive contacts, many Iranians, deeply embedded unfolding events Gary tells Mousavi evolved mild-mannered reformer directly challenging regime. Nobody, says, knows go, certainly Iranians. Khamenei exposed lost aura mystification, plunging arena political player. Mousavi issued new revolutionary manifesto, translated; I enclose Sick's report analysis it. This poses, Sick says, new challenge Khamenei. Does let stand? Does answer it? Sick also says US diplomacy fact can't accomplish anything regime crisis completely works way out, could take years. He points first mass demonstrations Shah occurred full year overthrow. He adds one thing regime learned fro m Shah equivocal toward demonstrations. Two ideas, knows, are: 1. Though regime uses Western protests consolidate control, contribute deep crisis legitimacy. Sick says Obama's statement, example, good. He also cites statement Ban Ki Moon. If would UN action, shouldn't focus ont human rights/violence aspect? A statement and/or resolution urging regime stop illegitimate violence paramilitary militias? US shouldn't initiate. 2.

Sid 5ousavi's New Revolutionary Manifesto Gary Sick June 21, 2009 I 10:51am — L Alfred, Sipa / AP Photo The Iranian protest movement reached tipping point today, writes Gary Sick, • key White House offical 1979 hostage crisis, emerged nothing short platform true Islamic democracy. Plus, read insight Iran's election Daily Beast writers. Today, Mir Hossein Mousavi, presidential candidate come represent democratic aspirations Iranian people, issued formal statement. Although denounces "lies fraud" leadership, particularly recent election, views fraudulent election symptom something far serious. He describes revolution gone wrong, revolution originally based attention voice peo ple resulted "forcing unwanted government nation." It apparent statement Mousavi's movement—and Mousavi himself—have evolved enormously past week. This moment "a turning point," says, defines movement forming around "historical mission" accomplish nothing less "renewing life nation" according ideals. He acknowledges, interestingly, voice beginning less "eloquent" would wished people ahead turning movement green. But accepts "burden duty put shoulders destiny generations ages." He denounces extremes political spectrum: one hand believe "Islamic government Tyranny Rightful;" other, "consider religion Islam blockers realization republicanism," i.e. believe democracy incompatible Islam. Mousavi says call annulment election revote, supervised impartial national body, "is given right." The objective nothing less "to achieve new type political life country." That truly revolutionary statement. He says stand side seeking "new solutions" n on-violent way. He accepts principles institutions Islamic Republic, including Revolutionary Guard basij, denounces "deviations deceptions." He demands reform "that returns us pure principles Islamic Revolution." He calls freedom expression forms, says government permits people express views freely, "there won't need presence military regulatory forces streets." It apparent statement Mousavi's movement—and Mousavi himself—have evolved enormously past week. The candidate started mild-mannered reformer. After searing events past several days, dared preach counter sermon Khamene'i's lecture Islamic government. Although never mentions Leader name, overlooking direct contradiction arguments. This open opposition Leader political figure unprecedented. • Mousavi fact issued manifesto new vision Islamic Republic.

Yesterday, June 21, Chatham House UK published detailed study Iranian vote, concluding close analysis election results fraud. This definitive objective analysis far. Sid http://www.chathamhouse.org.uk/files/14234_iranelection0609.pdf This paper published Chatham House Institute Iranian Studies, University St Andrews Preliminary Analysis Voting Figures Iran's 2009 Presidential Election Editor: Professor Ali Ansari, Director, Institute Iranian Studies, University St Andrews; Associate Fellow, Middle East North Africa Programme, Chatham House; author, 'Iran, Islam Democracy' Research Analysis: Daniel Berman Thomas Rintoul, Institute Iranian Studies, University St Andrews 21 June 2009 Chatham House independent owes allegiance government political body. It hold opinions own; views expressed text responsibility authors. This document issued understanding extract used, authors Chatham House credited, preferably date publication. Preliminary Analysis Voting Figures Iran's 2009 Presidential Election www.chathamhouse.org.uk 2 Executive Summary Working province province breakdowns 2009 2005 results, released Iranian Ministry Interior, 2006 census published official Statistical Centre Iran, following observations official data debates surrounding made. •In two conservative provinces, Mazandaran Yazd, turnout 100% recorded. •At provincial level, correlation increased turnout swing Ahmadinejad. This challenges notion Ahmadinejad's victory due massive participation previously silent conservative majority. •In third provinces, official results would require Ahmadinejad took former conservative voters, former centrist voters, new voters, also 44% former Reformist voters, despite decade conflict two groups. •In 2005, 2001 1997, conservative candidates, Ahmadinejad particular, markedly unpopular rural areas. That countryside always votes conservative myth. The claim year Ahmadinejad swept board rural provinces flies face trends. Preliminary Analysis Voting Figures Iran's 2009 Presidential Election www.chathamhouse.org.uk 3 1. Irregularities Voter Turnout Two provinces show turnout 100% four show turnout 90%. Regional variations participation disappeared. There correlation increase participation, swing Ahm adinejad. Firstly, across board massive increase turnout, several provinces increasing participation rate nearly 75%. This increase results substantially less variation turnout provinces, standard deviation amongst provincial turnouts falling 23% since 2005. The 2005 results show substantial turnout gap, seven provinces recording turnout 60%, ten 70%. In 2009, two 70% 24 80%. In fact, 21 30 provinces turnouts within 5% 83%. The data seems suggest regional variations participation suddenly disappeared. This makes evident lack sort correlation provinces saw increase turnout saw swing Ahmadinejad (Fig.1) unusual. There significant correlation increase participation given province swing Ahmadinejad (Fig.1). This lack correlation makes argument increase participation previously silent conservative majority won election Ahmadinejad somewhat problematic. Furthermore, concerns numbers themselves. Two provinces, Mazandaran Yazd, results indicate votes cast 12 June eligible voters four provinces turnouts mid-nineties. In country allegations 'tombstone voting' — practice200f using identity documents deceased cast additional ballots — longstanding widespread, result troubling perhaps unexpected. This problem start Ahmadinejad; according official statistics gathered International institute Democracy Electoral Assistance Stockholm, 12.9% registered voters time Mohammed Khatami's 2001 victory citizens voting age. In conclusion, number aspects reported turnout figures problematic. The massive increases 2005, collapse regional variations, absence clear correlation increases turnout increased support candidate make results problematic. Preliminary Analysis Voting Figures Iran's 2009 Presidential Election www.chathamhouse.org.uk 4 Source: Ministry Interior Publications 2005 2009 (See appendix) Preliminary Analysis Voting Figures Iran's 2009 Presidential Election www.chathamhouse.org.uk 5 2. Where Ahmadinejad's New Votes Come From? According official Ministry Interior voting data (see Appendix), Mahmud Ahmadinejad increased conservative vote 113% compared 2005 election. There little correlation provincial level results increase turnout swing President, challenging notion previously silent conservative majority come support him. Interestingly, 1.0 30 provinces, mainly former Mehdi Karrubi strongholds, official data suggests Ahmadinejad received votes former non-voters former Rafsanjani voters, also took 44% vote previously voted Reformist. According official data1, Mahmud Ahmadinejad received approximately 13m votes election combined conservative vote 2005 Presidential election2. Assuming Ahmadinejad retained 11.5m Conservative votes 2005, additional 13m votes could come three sources, descending order likelihood: •The approximately 10.6m citizens vote 2005, chose vote election •The 6.2m citizens voted centrist Rafsanjani 2005 •The 10.4m citizens voted Reformist candidates 2005 In order examine detail Ahmadinejad's increased support came from, table (Fig.3) shows composition 2009 vote province, dividing voted Conservative, Rafsanjani, Reformist 2005, vote 2005. It assumes 2005 voters vote again. The table demonstrates 10 Iran's 30 provinces highlighted red, order official statistics correct Ahmadinejad would needed win new voters, former Rafsanjani voters, also 44% former reformist voters. 1 Serious complaints raised 2005 elections 2009 elections. Government data perfectly reliable. 2 In 2005 three Conservative candidates first round. Ahmadinejad reasonably expected received 2009, votes cast Conservatives 2005. Here, Ahmadinejad's 2009 performance compared combined performance three Conservatives 2005. Preliminary Analysis Voting Figures Iran's 2009 Presidential Election www.chathamhouse.org.uk 6 It notable many provinces Reformist cleric Mehdi Karrubi polled highly 2005, government's figures would appear suggest former supporters voted tactically likely Reformist challenger Mir Hussein Musavi, many expected, rather defected hard-line conservative incumbent Ahmadinejad. This interpretation extent supported relationship percentage former Karrubi voters province, swing Ahmadinejad (Fig.2). To many Reformists, situation extremely unlikely. Mehdi Karrubi well-known reformist, polar opposite views Ahmadinejad issues political cultural freedoms, economic management, foreign policy. They allege fraud, likely provinces Karrubi's vote collapsed provide bulk 600+ complaints defeated c andidates lodging conduct election. However, Karrubi, like Ahmadinejad, seen 'man people', Ahmadinejad much re-incarnation Islamic Republic's early hard left leader current hard-right. Ahmadinejad's supporters thus claim rural voters voted Ahmadinejad 2009 precisely reasons voted Karrubi 2005. The data offers arbitration dispute, although Roukema's application statistical fraud detection techniques 'by district' data turned anomalies respect figures Karrubi's vote,3 may suggest created computer. These followed fully disaggregated 'by polling station' data released ongoing dispute. 3 B Roukena, 'Benford's Law Anomalies 2009 Iranian Presidential Election' (as yet unpublished article, 2009).

Do Rural Voters Support Ahmadinejad? Many commentators suggested, Presidential Election, Ahmadinejad popular rural areas explains high levels support. However, data 2005 Presidential election support contention. Instead, confirms support Ahmadinejad gain 2005 mainly urban suburban areas. The graphs show levels support Ahmadinejad rural population province question (Fig.4) Conservatives group (Fig.5). Preliminary Analysis Voting Figures Iran's 2009 Presidential Election www.chathamhouse.org.uk 10 Source: Ministry Interior Publications 2005 2009 Iranian Census 2006 (see appendix) This data supports con tention academic experts rural Iranian politics4 rural voters dedicated Ahmadinejad supporters occasionally described western media. This supported fact much Iran's rural population comprised ethnic minorities: Lors, Baluch, • Kurdish, Arab amongst others. These ethnic minorities history voting Reformist voting members ethnic group. For example, important segment Khatami's vote 1997 2001 voted largely Karrubi Mostafa Moin 2005. The 2009 data suggests sudden shift political support precisely rural provinces, previously supported Ahmadinejad conservative (Fig.5) showing substantial swings Ahmadinejad (Fig.6). At time, official data suggests vote Mehdi Karrubi, extremely popular rural, ethnic minority areas 2005, collapsed entirely even home province Lorestan, vote gone 440,247 (55.5%) 2005 44,036 (4.6%) 2009.

I London I'm participating interesting forum sponsored Princeton Project National Security Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) Transatlantic Program, I've received one email -- three -- prominent insider journalists policy hands Jim Jones' tenure National Security Adviser highly fragile. One emails reports starkly: Knives getting longer That's contact said. But emails intimated serious tone-deafness Jones role responsibilities, relationship President, relationship younger, dedicated, hardworking late-working staff. Jones recently said National Security Council staff members stayed longer 7:30 pm must disorganized work. I speak various NSC officials -- often 10:00 11:00 pm night. They hardworking, racing fast manage many, many, many major initiatives Barack Obama decided simultaneously pursue. James Jones considered admirers genius thinking management structures decision-making processes. On hand, critics see plodding, slow-moving, touch retired general better prepared think last era rather one moving into. His °critics think he's unable animate nimble, high flex policy decision making products White House manic dash get lot top tier issues dealt with. Friends National Security Council respect great deal way NSC Deputy Tom Donilon managing brief Many see picking load Jones seems unable unwilling carry.

Let's discuss.
Dear Secretary Clinton, I hope elbow healing quickly. I mentioned work maritime developments region Persian Gulf East China Sea Sea Japan. Below key findings report, main takeaway political impact Chinese military modernization may greater narrow technical analysis China's capabilities would suggest, range reasons, technical political, prospects regional cooperation limited, pathways conflict numerous increasing. All best, Jackie Key findings workshop include: • Chinese naval modernization proceeded rates higher forecast 10 years ago created capability complicate operation US carrier battle groups within 1,000 kilometers Chinese coastline. • The Indian Ocean may coming decades operating area SSBNs countries limited experience sustained SSBN patrols, including India, China, possibly Pakistan. • Chinese maritime relations countries along littoral area continued develop, new friendly relationship emerging Sri Lanka, complement existing relations Myanmar Pakistan. This may lead new form "blue-brown water" naval operations, Chinese naval forces operate far Chinese bases, close coasts client states. The workshop tended conclusion trends region make maritime cooperation easy. These trends include: Japanese concern Chinese dominance waters within 1,000 miles Chinese territory immediate consequences Japan's maritime autonomy. • Indian suspicion Chinese naval developments Hainan Island, Chinese development port infrastructure Pakistan Myanmar, possibility Chinese ballistic missile submarines operating close India. • Indian interest SSBNs, plus Chinese SSBN ports Hainan even, possibly, Pakistani SSBNs, creates possibility multiple SSBN patrols Indian Ocean, along potential naval nuclear accidents sea. • Asymmetries levels operational competence, technology, submarines maritime aviation, which, example, make functional multi-national naval cooperation harder states afraid revealing technologies weaknesses. • The major role land-based maritime warfare strike complexes region, means war sea always carries risk escalation strikes ground targets homeland areas. The report also offers two scenarios United States may consider engaging militarily region. The first scenario, concerns clash Japan China waters claimed both, compels us consider: • The circumstances Chinese may seek demonstrate new maritime capabilities must taken seriously respected, • What United States would lose support Japanese, faced world Japan became either subordinate power China nuclear armed state, capable pursuing national interest independent United States. The second scenario concerns American naval blockade Iran tested nuclear weapon, potentially giving rise interaction United States China far operating bases close territory client China, "blue-brown water" clash. In scenario, China using navy show presence, force United States ask whether wants go war China political conflict less black white. Thinking options would left United States circumstances underscores Chinese naval forces may political impact 2025 narrow assessment military capabilities would suggest.

Secretary Clinton, Thank you! Will update I hear her, anything else I do, let know. All best, Jackie ps Saw Foreign Minister Yeo schedule today. Fyi, one favorite Singaporeans 2007 speech China, posted blog (!): April 12, 2007 Foreign Minister George Yeo's speech dinner organised Lee Kuan Yew School Public Policy 5 February 2007, gave off-the-cuff. Thank Kishore kind words. Dear friends, ladies gentlemen. I India two weeks ago, good trip, spent nine days there. While Calcutta calling Chief Minister, I bit time look around I attended mass Mother Theresa's house. Very interesting gathering; Singapore nun there, ten years; Sister Maria Tony. I wondered someone Singapore would want dedicate life picking dead dying back alleys Calcutta living life. There many nuns ninth year. They take first vow fifth year, renewable every year. In tenth year decide - final vows eternity. So sure, please, there's way out; sure, you're room. So priest gave tough sermon talking, I could hear din traffic noise outside, streets Calcutta. Then suddenly, I heard call muezzin. Now Hindu city. I told myself, I thought wow, diversity country, India, ability internalise diversity find unremarkable tiny woman Albania come midst, become one beatified, celebrated Indian, way canonization. China India comparison- China India. China different sense itself; deep internal construction different. Superficially similarities, China US China Europe. But look it's deep construction, different. When talk China's future China 21st century, China behave world community, China's attitudes towards democracy, towards law, towards social justice. It important first look deep construction nature. Naturally deterministic, nothing inevitable human history, understand nature, becomes easier anticipate moves you'll less suprised actions. A years ago, Chinese government embarked major project dynastic duty- write history Qing dynasty, Manchus, 1368 1644. Ever since Han dynasty, roughly contemporaneous Roman Empire, developed historiographic tradition dynasty writing history previous period. So Sima Qian Later Han wrote earlier Han entire period that; later wrote Later Han, Jin wrote Three Kingdoms; Ming wrote Yuan: The Yuan, Mongol origins wrote Sung. Sung wrote Tang dynasty Classical Period. The last dynasty, Qing, collapsed Republican Revolution 1911; 2007. I think 2003, embarked project, 'The Official History Qing dynasty'. When former Vice Premier Li Lanqing Singapore recently, I asked it. He said "we told scholars rush project". I asked long would take write history. He said would take many years, easily 10 years. I said, "have collected material?" He said yes. I asked, "external sources?" He said yes, external sources too. All countries, Vatican, European countries, whole lot; assembled - 24 official histories, would 26th. And Li's instruction quick draw conclusions! Now Mao Tze Tung revolutionary, great revolutionary. He overturned everything knew history, read 24 histories, read them, annotated them. But wrote terrible, illegible scrawl, scholars decipher scrawls. Then wrote commentaries commentaries it's published. It difficult Chinese depart history it's great plains, mountains less, neighbours less seen patterns recur. So long time ago Ming dynasty wrote romantic period Three Kingdoms. The first line said: "Below heaven, great movements, great currents, long disunity leads unity long unity leads disunity." So accept part deep nature cycles civilisation; ups downs. In recent years, visit them, could sense feeling re-emergence, it's bit scary. In initial years, lacking confidence, asked many questions, know organic vitality. It like adolescent watches development, conscious it. I say scary us live periphery empire, happens radiate influence us eventually, greater lesser degree envelope us. How see China? I think begin with, it's important try and, intellectual viewpoint, transpose experiences China, I believe develop according logic, according DNA. It growing now, continue grow, develop contradictions one day contradictions, many years now, lead decline. So say beginning dynasty taxes light treasury full, end dynasty, taxes crushing treasury empty. The important thing realise China things deeply resistant change. Take Confucius. Every time overturn dynasty, overturn Confucius, Confucius justified status quo. So throughout 19th century, whether Taiping Revolution, Communist movement Sun Yat Sen; spent lives debunking Confucius. It reached final moment criticised Zhou Enlai together Confucius- no- Lin Biao together Confucius. That last paroxysm. Today, Hu Jingtao said [in Mandarin He Xie She Hui ], "harmonious society". Suddenly hear resonance Confucius coming back. And everywhere world pattern Alliance Francaise, Goethe Institute, USIA, establish Confucius Institutes learning Confucianist classics coming back remarkable force China, yet state curriculum parents wanting teach children Confucianist ditties. Now important? From Mao Deng Jiang Zemin, every stage, re-interpreted Marx. They comfortable young Marx, idea superstructure economic base, idea politics concentrated economics- like. But class struggle, downplay. They talk Three Represents, progressive forces, progressive elements, nurture those. Now Hu Jingtao says "harmonious society", "peaceful re-emergence". This mindset certain attitude towards law, certain attitude towards religion, towards democracy towards foreign policy I would like, deal turn. Joseph Needham many years ago, I think 60's, man wrote The Science Civilisation China, great encyclopedic work; said Chinese legal tradition. In fact, estimation, Chinese greater corpus legal codification West. A greater corpus legal codification West! Surprise, surprise. But idea Emperor law, completely alien thinking. Where idea come from? Well West, may trace back Hammurabi, may trace back Moses, Greece, Rome. But trace evolution DNA, goes back, way back, early beginnings. The Chinese different evolutionary starting point. It law, idea call '1i' proper conduct among human beings. They believe, deep instincts, law means towards justice, outcome law perverse, law must overridden, justice, proper conduct, proper relationship among human beings must take precedence. And suddenly say happened previous dynasties, earlier histories summarised, wrong instead adopt something origins Western Europe, crowning moment crowning Charlemagne Pope year 800; them, talking about? For Chinese, laws like regulations, means towards larger end. Their attitude towards democracy follows parallel pattern. Democracy end itself, democracy means quite happy consider democracy useful means towards government appropriate places appropriate levels, democracy good. So village township level democracy, universal franchise. They approve slate candidates, fierce elections, fierce campaigning, incompetent arrogant despotic, get chucked out. But reach level cities provinces, say no. No direct democracy. Why not? Because believe, view universe, way produce good government. Any Catholic Church believes way elect Pope universal franchise. That parishioners decide parish priest. The Parish Council, maybe, that's ok. But parish priest? Bishops? Universal franchise? That's God's laws. They kind instinct embedded them, Communist, Chinese. And know much democracy, invariably leads 'localitis'; favouritism towards friends, relatives, people villages relationship with. We problem Singapore, fact problem exists throughout East Asia. Till today, apart Singapore, among Chinese communities among many East Asian communities, idea ultimate control business go outside family unpersuasive. You talk Li Ka-shing, talk Robert Kwok, talk Lim Soe Liong, talk them; go back family. Why? Because believe end, matters deepest level, trust. And family guarantees trust. This also Indian wisdom. So Marwaris controlling economy Calcutta, Parsees, Sindhis, Kishore member, Chettiars. They operate basis deep trust completely different level contract law. And distrust local affiliations, two dynasties, Ming Qing, senior official could serve within 400 miles born. No local official serve within 400 miles, words, Singapore, Singaporean govern Singapore. They go beyond that, today there's almost province China provincial leader province. Now consider this, transpose onto Europe, it's routinely, President France French. And German, disqualified Chancellor Republic. And Italian cannot trusted serve Rome. Ancient wisdom! What remarkable accepted legitimate. If Cantonese Northener squatting you, consider perverse abomination. This part life fact, likely impartial governor local boy there, likely favour related friends. So talk democracy Chinese, cultural backdrop. So applied Qing dynasty, Ming dynasty, taken step recently China. They introduced even rules, governing circumstances disqualified serving area near born. You can't stay ministry long, can't stay department long beacuse stay long, develop affiliations affiliations result sidedoors guanxi corruption. Of course, many rules still breached, scandals time time act scandals. For long central leadership pristine, system maintained. But one day become corrupt, many previous dynasties, downward spiral begins. And difficult situation reverse it. So I mentioned table India, it's country sustain revolution, deep structure would allow it. I think China country renewed periodic revolutions. Kishore asked when- I said well maybe 200 years time long cycles expect matter course history People's Republic would written People's Republic. It written next dynasty. Except right say shouldn't call dynasty, democrats, republic, Emperor...Well, whatever term call it, done much later. Let talk attitude towards religion. Being Roman Catholic I follow quite closely ups downs relationship Vatican I find quite fascinating. The Jesuits, went China Ming dynasty, hoped could convert Emperor, China would become Catholic great mission would achieved. They never succeeded. Some brightest minds Europe went there. Matteo Ricci, corrected Chinese calendar, repaired clocks palace, saw throne, never got meet Emperor died China. And tomb, it's compound Beijing Party School today. And church founded still today. 'Li Matou', that's called himself, applied permission buried China given permission. Then Manchus swept southwards, 1644, missionaries thought chance, "the Manchus bit accomodating towards us, yet Christianise China". So read despatches missionaries period, Tartar Wars described it, full hope. But chance. They appealed Second Emperor, Kangxi. "Can send missionaries?" "No problem". "Can report papal legate Beijing" "No thing". The Emperor imposed one condition: "you send many priests want China must die China, cannot leave that". You see, instinctively, Chinese, see Catholic Church, see someone like themselves, someone whose claim members total. And loyalty jealous one. Mind try control everything; control big things, dogma, doctrine. After left financially independent, big issue appoints ministers provincial secretaries, it's Pope appointing Bishops Bishops ordaining Priests governing vast empire, whether we're talking Chinese empire Catholic empire. They number members world interaction complex difficult one. And appointment Bishops, seek ultimate authority. In end got find way resolve it. I anticipate Vatican's argument "we realm, realm, please conflict". As Chinese leaders, attitude towards religion earliest days keep religion arm's length. Those govern empire, areligious, private religions, matters public conduct, Confucianist. In public, Catholic, Muslim, Buddhist. When Jesuits went China, impressed - possible create moral order based religion ethics. So impressed, wrote it, influenced people like Voltaire Encyclopedists. It helped inspire Frence revolution- could get rid Church, still maintain moral order society. I've talked China law, China democracy, China religion, let talk China foreign policy perhaps greatest interest; I talk generally experts field. I think it's difficult Chinese break old mindset [Zhong Guo], Middle Kingdom, center Universe, 'chopsticks peoples' semi-Sinic. I think consider Singapore semi-Sinic. Then beyond realm, Greeks would called Barbarians. The Mongols, Manchus, Europeans, Americans, Indians on. Now jargon course use today. They civilised, welcome great hospitality - lavish dinners, courteous words, offering best everything house. It reminded way mother used teach us home, big family stranger got treated well, visitor treated well, afraid visitor. So always treat visitors better family members visitor capricious, harm make sure fit in. Those within authority, always maintain order anyway. This way, minds, universe ordered. So I understand Koreans, Japanese, Vietnamese, extent, Singaporeans, feel uncomfortable see repetition pattern seen many times past. Will Chinese change principle foreign policy, I think have, because, never history met, existed close contact competing centers power, US, Europe, India, longer separated oceans cannot crossed, mountains cannot crossed, connected. So making adjustments. It interesting watch handle Olympics; Olympics become exercise pure Chinese nationalism, I think international reaction China severe. But I think Chinese sophisticated. I expect organise cheer teams Americans, Japanese, appearance courtesy common humanity. They careful ensure words fit conditions today. But let say defence many methods use arise fear, desire dominate. If analyse old tributary system, sent tributes got gave return. It became racket. So Japanese merchants competed get tokens [Ryukyu] order able China trade meant lot money. The Chinese fearful foreigners. They fearful Russians north, Muslims West, Indians across Himalayas, mostly Americans across Pacific. Their strategy keep temperature low, low profile, hide shine armour, shine sword, play game concentrate economic development. Internally make preparations? I doubt, deep fear. Is intention dominate, conquer, way European powers past? I don't think so. I don't think great desire turn non-Chinese Chinese. Maybe Korea, maybe Vietnam, maybe Mongolia, various points time part greater empire, might consider worth civilising. But beyond that, Sinicising Indians, Russians? No, I don't think want that. So become stronger powerful, I believe old nature re-assert itself, also reacting us. If find world threatening place, develop responses threats. Quite early day, wanted neutralise Southeast Asia, Asean. It never area threatened them, historically. So didn't worry Southeast Asia threat. But resources, sea lanes, go Southeast Asia. And made dramatic move years ago. Zhu Rongji ASEAN-China summit. He said, "free trade agreement". At time announced it, leaders ASEAN almost fell chairs. We thought China economic threat us. Not partner. Took us almost year digest implications say yes, let's negotiate. Step step. And time China assuring us would benefit would benefit. When Framework Agreement signed Zhu Rongji 2002 Phonm Penh, made two remarkable statements. He said 10 years, agreement benefits China benefits Southeast Asia, let us renegotiate it. I never imagine American USTR, European Trade Commissioner, talking like that. I mean contract, deal deal, it's settled eternity. Then said: "China seek exclusive position Southeast Asia", acknowledged going date one girl, intended promiscuous beginning. Towards Northeast Asia, I think complicated, much history legacy. Towards Central Asia, towards Russia, deep fears. Towards America, become relationship bound together many points, rupture would become unthinkable. But going difficult relationship, important difficult relationship manage century. If it's badly managed war, it's properly managed another generation peace hundreds millions people world would raised depths poverty. In area, experts, whenever I see China watch moves, I go back deep nature it's easy country vast, sense itself, depart much deep nature. Thank you.

pvervee Secretary Clinton — I understand going Kenya next week I know trip primarily focused trade issues, I wanted flag issue I know near dear heart. Kenya one strictest anti-abortion laws Africa — illegal unless woman's life risk criminalizes woman provider. Two years ago, Kenyan authorities imprisoned doctor two nurses, falsely accusing providing illegal abortions. After year prison, providers found innocent released, galvanized legal provider community formed coalition make abortion less restrictive. It come surprise that, result abortion law, Kenya one highest maternal mortality rates Africa, estimated 800 women day seeking procedure, often dangerous means. Kenya restarting long-stalled constitutional review process hope produce final Constitution next year. Religious groups concerted crusade include new language Constitution would codify "life begins conception". The current Constitution largely silent issue. If fetal personhood amendment goes forward, would place Kenya small community nations provision. It would clearly mark Kenya stop countries attempting institutionalize African Union's Maputo Protocol, one progressive regional documents women, development reproductive rights, vast majority African countries general. For country trying regain momentum stability success enjoyed recently, policy imposition would regression women's rights country writ large. I went Kenya last month work coalition formed strategize Constitutional amendment work toward less restrictive abortion law. I also visited several clinics providers Nairobi nearby villages Planned Parenthood programs train providers post abortion care. You seen million times travels around world, I don't need tell poignant stories lives saved lost, bravery standing constant government harassment, fear potential Constitutional amendment mean provision safe medical services. I know asking lot, way could draw attention issue Kenya, would even personal hero already are. It hope Kenya knows world watching may careful proceed. Of course would happy help way decide want something there. There also Congressional delegation going Kenya week August 8th working side meeting issue well. As always, thank much do.

He says reach US mission UN office. FYI, Wash Post today: "The issue seriously take fraud charges, whether force runoff, also caused rare public rift within international community here. The senior American official U.N. mission, Peter W. Galbraith, left country abruptly Sunday dispute mission director, Norwegian Kai Eide. "Galbraith pushed exhaustive probe.

Galbraith convinced Karzai could win without fraud tried reduce number polling stations areas south, incumbent's ethnic stronghold, said one diplomatic source. Eide others, source said, convinced Karzai would win case irregularities could smoothed over, 2004 presidential election Karzai won safe margin." And, I've included Jane Smiley's rave review Max's book. Sid http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jane-smiley/republican-gomorrah_b290293.html Your request processed... Jane Smiley Pulitzer Prize-Winning Novelist Essayist Posted: September 17, 2009 02:56 PM HuffPost Book Review: Republican Gomorrah About twenty years ago, I read article death row inmate shot clerk convenience store. The way murder presented man death row mysterious--his hand rose gun went off. Shooting clerk face midst robbery wasn't fact fault. He never said, "I shot man." It happened. I thought man reading Max Blumenthal's terrific, also, course, appalling new book, Republican Gomorrah. Apparently isn't single person present incarnation Republican party anything. Things happen--God it. Satan it. No Republican agent success failure, sin redemption. It happens. The consequences lack responsibility see--screaming threats, guns rallies, unhinged behavior every time Republican doesn't feel way wants feel, absolute sense powerlessness leading directly absolute power. Because thing struck murderer 7-11--he power last moments, clerk knew it. But killer, matter well armed, never felt it. Republican Gomorrah frightening book clear us outside various Republican operatives surround James Dobson ilk consciences stop nothing. They invoke name God purposes shame God absolutely--hurting, destroying, maiming, damning others either don't accept beliefs don't acknowledge power righteousness. Of course frightening. But Blumenthal's cast characters, beginning Dobson prodigal son, Ryan, including John Hagee, Sarah Palin, Ralph Reed, Charles Colson, Judith Reisman, Christina Regnery, Donald Wildmon, et al. strike reader else small--egocentric, narrow minded, uneducated, selfish, resentful. Each qualities destructive The combination turning coercive. Even us immune emotions people play upon getting nervous power wish exert. Blumenthal two things one else I read manages do--the first organizes network. He shows Ted Bundy connected James Dobson connected Gary Bauer connected Erik Prince connected Ralph Reed connected Jack Abramoff connected Tom Delay connected Tony Perkins connected David Duke connected Mel Gibson, forth, course tracing connections, informs us, reminds us, crimes misdemeanors people committed. Two favorites James Dobson's son Ryan's messy divorce (Dad seems paid settlement--did dare discipline? Or discipline much?) David Vitter's habitual recourse brothel New Orleans Republicans "wanted spanked tortured wear stockings--Republicans impeccable taste silk stockings" (the madam talking men). Republican Gomorrah full crimes-- we've already heard of, Abramoffs Ted Haggard's, haven't (there good evidence Texas billionaire T. Cullen Davis, funder right wing Council For National Policy, ordered hits estranged wife, succeeded murdering step-daughter wife's boyfriend). This aspect book reminds Scottish novel called The Private Memoirs And Confessions Of A Justified Sinner James Hogg, which, man believes among saved, commit sin wants sure go heaven. Once Davis "saved," example, said, "My goal get heaven. I'll anything takes get there, I'm going let anything stand way." He must thought getting heaven another power play. And power plays key right wing psychology. Right wing psychology thing Blumenthal offer. At periphery world run-of-the-mill bully, man like Jack Abramoff, whose brutality well remembered high school classmates, sang like bird caught. At center James Dobson, much destructive figure Abramoff, advocates, strongest terms, child beating, child-beating, dog-beating. At one point brags going family canine (who weighed twelve pounds) engaging "the vicious fight ever staged man beast." As children, goal keep beating child "he wants(s) crumple breast parent." In words, Dobson proud sadist thinks sadism kind funny, who, years, successfully advocated sadism workable form child-rearing. It order understand deeply disturbing effect Dobson theories culture, Blumenthal cites Erich Fromm's Escape Freedom, psychology Nazism authoritarianism, Eric Hoffer's The True Believer. Insofar finds documentation, Blumenthal points many powerful Evangelical Christians beaten abused children (including Dobson). It's high number. The beatings, often arbitrary, cruel, frequent, then, many cases, backed constant lessons God--that arbitrary, cruel, demands obedience things, surpasseth understanding. The point exercises establish powerlessness child, shame guilt worthless sinner, absolute fear thinking He take place hierarchy thereby reinforce existence hierarchy. Blumenthal goes pretty far psychology, but, view, far enough. I'm sure reared liberal parents, gave sense responsibility, curiosity, autonomy, since thirties, I don't think really empathizes tortured damaged souls interviewing watching last years. I don't think understands fear--how deep is, constant is, arousing is. I don't think, fact, Max Blumenthal looks within sees evil. I think looks within, says, "I'm okay; you're okay." That's goal liberal parenting, tell statistics cites concerning unwed pregnancy, divorce, occurrence STDs, liberal parenting works-- atheists agnostics, example, much lower rate divorce Evangelicals, states sex education schools, rather abstinence-only education, lower rates teen pregnancy. But child beaten enough eventually comes understand two things all--that world makes sense (and try make sense it?) world dangerous oneself, even try figure oneself might be, death-defying exercise. There safety two things--conforming group and, part group, dominating even destroying groups. The rules group anything all, long members group abide them. And groups abide them, too, painful arbitrary rules group abides meaningless. The beaten child's sense terror assuaged evanescent feelings power, relation parents God, defined powerless. When "crumples" "loving" breast parent (and view person administers beating living 1/16th size doesn't know love is) accepts powerlessness also accepts power defines life. That's freedom mine come in. Many Evangelicals Blumenthal discusses Christian Dominionists--that is, differ Taliban choice doctrine. Their uses doctrine (to dehumanize women groups, never share power, control every aspect every life within power, create society steeply hierarchical structure top) Taliban. It's eye-opener read R.J. Rushdoony, son Armenian immigrants fled Armenian genocide 1915. You would think man whose family escaped mass murder would go espouse peace, love, understanding, Rushdoony went way, taking literally 613 laws Book Leviticus. In book, The Institutes Biblical Law, advocates capital punishment "disobedient children, unchaste women, apostates, blasphemers, practitioners witchcraft, adulterers," homosexuals. Gary North, Presbyterian Christian Reconstructionist, son-in-law, and, backing mass death penalty, advocates stoning rather burning stake, stoning cheaper (and course factor, would lot people exterminate). As would killing (of me, could catch us), well, Christians would, wanted to. Ever unable accept responsibility, assign agency God, wants us killed, beat us "crumple" "loving" breast, God given us sorts talents, skills, interests, is, like Christian Dominionists, interested power. I believe motto "Adore I hurt you." Can believe God small? When I parent young children, I, too, got frustrated, I, too, thought spanking might good thing. I soon realized motives administering physical punishment highly suspect--more anger frustration care child knowledge effective methods.

Works horses, dogs, animals, too. It I decided I, human weakness, could put two two together concerning free proper behavior, surely God could, also. I didn't want believe God smaller myself. And I don't. The ray hope Blumenthal's book right-wingers talks tend psychologically unstable don't much staying power--think Ted Haggard. But numbers. The bad thing could take control. The defeat Sarah Palin, Conrad Burns (R-MT), George Allen (R- VA), Rick Santorum (R-PA), James Talent (R-MO), Mike DeWine (R-OH) brought us "back brink" according website Theocracy Watch. But back brink. The good thing would able maintain call government long (see George W. Bush). The bad thing would destroy country know trying. If I take long view, well, I think, Stalinism lasted 25 years, Nazism 12. The Iranian Mullahs 30 years. Russia Germany survived, Iran might, well. But generations lost places. And Stalin Hitler didn't nuclear weapons. I think 22-year-old clerk convenience store, looking barrel pistol. He probably idea killer sense agency, hardly even knew doing, seeing hand separate himself. But I feel sorry killer, too, subject feelings could label terrifying overpowering. I bet beaten, shamed, neglected child. I bet, afterward, wished someone, somehow, stopped him.

It actually happened yesterday found fact. Todd said would send read out.

Hillary: FYI: I found one sensible informed brief articles Afghanistan. Patrick Cockburn, London Independent, one best informed on-the-ground journalists. He almost always correct Iraq. Sid Patrick Cockburn: To say war must won year nonsense http://www.independent co.uk/opinion/commentators/patrick-cockbum-to-say-this-war-must-be-won- in-a-year-is-nonsense-1799296.html Thursday, 8 October 2009 SPONSORED LINKS: Eight years ago I standing hill 50 miles north Kabul watching flashes night sky US air strikes started st Taliban front line. There ineffective puffs fire Taliban anti-aircraft guns could nothing bombs missiles raining them. It strange war cover, least little real fighting took place. The reputation Afghan fighting man partly based agilely joining winning side right moment. In meantime don't fight hard anybody try avoid getting killed. The US British press mostly reported war 2001 real military conflict rather missed point Taliban gone home. I remember visiting former headquarters Taliban armoured brigade city Ghazni south west Kabul. The tanks armoured vehicles smashed pieces American bombs, I asked local people many men Taliban lost, I told "none all. They could see going happen ran away." Just US military victory 2001 overstated, eight years later sense military crisis busily stoked Gen Stanley A McChrystal, top US NATO commander Afghanistan. In Washington military officials quoted saying war won lost next twelve months. This nonsense. The Taliban able advance rapidly last three years Pakistani backing spectacular political military weakness President Hamid Karzai's government. But Taliban draw strength Pashtun community, makes 42 per cent Afghan population. They great difficulty advancing areas occupied 58 per cent population Tajik, Hazara Uzbek majority. Squads six eight Taliban motorcycles might harassing roads around Kabul, need treat North Vietnamese divisions gates Saigon 1975. The strength Taliban take hold territory, inflict quite small military losses US politically unacceptable back home. They roadside bombs, something US army speaks f new device, though used British army Ireland 1921. If Americans British try hold territory supposedly cleared Taliban penny packets troops vulnerable suddenly targeted side. It prevent happening Gen McChrystal asked extra 40,000 soldiers. But Afghans tell foreign troops simply mean violence dead Afghans country becomes battlefield. It absurd imagine world's heavily equipped military force going use weapons comes attack. Polls also show Taliban support height areas Afghan civilians killed American shells bombs. So Obama do? First time. He going win lose war next year. Like stuck Mr Karzai get used idea. It reasonable suggest helping produce larger Afghan army police force cannot done overnight. Most military recruits money malnourished even wear American flack jackets. Speeding security training f Afghan police meant summer terrified men, often heroin, sent man dangerous isolated police posts three weeks training. Many come back. One way Obama could strengthen Afghan army police make sure men paid properly. In Kabul many facilities guarded policemen earning $70 month, enough live unless supplemented bribes. This contrasts $250,000 year paid foreign consultants lurk inside heavily defended compounds. Paying Iraqi army properly really make difference Baghdad might Afghanistan 40 per cent men unemployed. A difference Iraqi oil revenues last year $62 billion Afghan government dependent foreign aid. The US allies pay. It carefully thought measures like Obama considering panicky dispatch US Special Forces tens thousand troops.

S William Hague addresses US fears Tories' EU allies •Hillary Clinton 'told antisemitism allegations smear' •Shadow foreign secretary opposes Tony Blair EU leader • Ewen MacAskill Washington Nicholas Watt • quardian.co.uk, Thursday 22 October 2009 00.33 BST William Hague, shadow foreign secretary, yesterday defended Conservatives' alliance far-right parties Europe meeting Washington US secretary state, Hillary Clinton. Hague sought reassure Clinton Conservatives' partners, whose members taken part commemoration services Waffen-SS Latvia questioned need apologise anti-Jewish pogrom Poland. The shadow foreign secretary, said excellent meeting Clinton, told accusations part smear campaign Guardian others. The row overshadowed Hague's visit Washington intended part Conservative preparations taking power. Speaking media afterwards, Hague said behaviour Michal Kaminski, Poland's Law Justice party, consistent anyone antisemitic. As Latvian party Conservatives' European alliance, Hague said: "This respectable party Latvia ... To suggest antisemitic neo-Nazi ludicrous." Jewish groups US Europe expressed anger Tory links. The state department careful drawn issue, wanting accused interference UK politics issues relating European parliament. A spokesman said: "I say two good, wide-ranging discussion broad range issues, can't get details substance discussion." Hague tried persuade Clinton Conservatives' Euroscepticism would necessarily mean Britain would play lesser role European affairs. The US favours EU acting unison Iran issues. Hague said raised allegations antisemitism Clinton end 40-minute discussion Iran, Balkans, Middle East, Northern Ireland, Afghanistan climate change. "No one raised day issue, parties grouping, I raised secretary state Clinton press reports newspaper [the Guardian] others case seen those," Hague said. "I assured mainstream parties centre-right ... The Conservative party rejects regards smear campaign members." He noted Kaminski made first speech European Parliament highlighting problem anti-semitism Europe completed successful visit Israel. "These habits someone anti-semitic," Hague said. As Latvians, six governing parties, "five members involved type commemoration criticised." Some members Conservatives' previous alliance, European People's party. On Conservative Euroscepticism, Hague said: "I always put case American leaders important distinguish Europe's institutions capacity act ... I explained others find Conservative government active activist beginning European affairs. " Later said would mistake Tony Blair become EU president. He previously said private Blair would appointed "over dead body". http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-10-10/irm-contras-scary-sequel Iran-Contra's Scary Sequel Art Levine The Daily Beast October 10, 2009 I 6:55pm Republicans opened new front Obama, southern front, south border—Latin America. The clique conservatives operated since Iran-Contra scandal held key policy offices George W. Bush administration waging war Obama part Sen. Jim DeMint South Carolina. A freshman Foreign Relations Committee previously known expertise Latin America, DeMint best known boasting health care would "Waterloo" "break" Obama. He recently provoked nasty spat within committee requesting funding travel Honduras "assess" crisis. The Obama administration favors reinstalling democratically elected president, Manuel Zelaya, leftist expelled military June. Committee Chairman John Kerry criticized DeMint "intransigence" putting hold two Obama nominations State Department jobs Latin America, initially denied money DeMint's trip. But Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell somehow found funding Defense Department. "DeMint using issue cynically hold hostage entire U.S. policy Latin America order defend coup," says Adam Isacson, Latin American specialist Washington's Center International Policy. "Little Honduras brought ghosts Cold War closet, paralyzed policy provoking [DeMint] holds," Julia Sweig, director Latin American Studies Council Foreign Relations, told me. Some Hill staffers even blunter: "These losers Bush administration drove Latin American policy frickin' cliff trying rescue legacy," one aide told The Daily Beast. A number Democrats foreign-policy experts contend mounting right-wing attack Latin American policy filled void left Obama administration slow cut aid take firmer stance president installed Honduran military, Roberto Micheletti. Driven partly desire appease opposition Congress distaste left-wing populists Obama administration "slow-walked" response coup summer, Sweig says. More recently, though, administration toughened approach cutting vital aid worth least $35 million blocking Honduran officials' visas. The goal: pressure Micheletti regime enter serious negotiations Organization American States restore democratic government Zelaya. Informed observers say indications Micheletti's flexibility alarmed right-wingers Washington helped trigger DeMint's visit buck regime's resistance. An informal network right-leaning American advocacy groups ideologues entangled anti-Zelaya legal PR battles Honduras coup. Among them: Otto Reich, Cuban-American headed State Department's now-defunct Office Public Diplomacy Iran-Contra scandal, subsequently investigated special joint congressional panel—and U.S. Comptroller General, found engaged "prohibited covert activities" using public funds attack Reagan's critics. Reich, later appointed President George W. Bush assistant secretary Western Hemisphere Affairs private consultant, launched media campaign Zelaya coup alleging corruption. "Your Loony Left sources say I architect Iran-Contra like say I'm architect Zelaya coup," told phone Panama. He disputes claims illegal Iran-Contra activites "crap," asserting based fired House staffer's unpublished memo. But Greg Grandin, Latin American history professor NYU, darker view Reich's role: "It's kind origins Swift Boating," says. "It's related he's now." Conservative supporters current Honduran government argue arcane legal grounds worldwide condemnation coup. "It's first time all, countries world wrong," Reich told me. He criticized sees erroneous reporting Latin American controversies, taking The New York Times task article last Thursday says implied paid lobby behalf Micheletti regime. "I guess facts interfered [the] story," says. "Can believe sources say The New York Times malicious deserves slow death experiencing?" A DeMint spokesman says senator hasn't even met Reich talk Honduras, although Reich aide says they've spoken DeMint's staff. Adding mystery coup, left-wingers Latin America U.S. floated conservatives say unproven conspiracy theories Reich somehow played role destabilizing Zelaya's regime. He firmly denied The Daily Beast: "I cannot possibly answer Loony Left conspiracy charges me. But I try: I nothing removal Zelaya." But rumors may add aura power founder Otto Reich Associates. He's drawn attention new Honduras allegations penning column Miami Herald boldly headlined, "I Did Not Orchestrate Coup Honduras." Perhaps primary influence DeMint's thinking right-wing Honduran-American lawyer Miguel Estrada, whose 2001 nomination U.S. Court Appeals D.C. Circuit rejected Senate. In addition Reich, former Bush administration officials played key roles influencing DeMint spreading arguments Honduran regime include Roger Noriega, former aide late Sen. Jesse Helms (the far-right chairman Foreign Relations Committee) also served assistant secretary Western Hemisphere Affairs 2003 2005. On July 2, Noriega appeared The NewsHour Jim Lehrer argue legitimacy new Honduran regime. He identified former ambassador Organization American States visiting fellow American Enterprise Institute— paid agent pro-regime forces.

"It's weak," told me. "It doesn't enough It doesn't achieve real cost savings. There's real competition. It's pretty much wish list insurance companies." And merely Weiner's substantive criticisms bill. His political assessment even harsher: "It's effectively dead," said. Not droplet Weiner's dismissal Baucus plan came sort shock; he's trashing Senate Finance Committee's efforts weeks. What's surprising anyone gives fig Weiner say topic first place. Until six months ago, all, congressman known yearning acquire keys Gracie Mansion mastery arcana Medicare reimbursement rates. In fact, Weiner would first admit, interest in, knowledge of, record health-care reform perilously close nonexistent. And yet, since May, concluded taking Mike Bloomberg challenge went beyond Sisyphean realm plain silly, Weiner emerged one real stars marathon health-care debate: clearest savviest (and, always, loudest noodgiest) voice favor public option. And though it's plain whatever bill eventually lands Barack Obama's desk—and, yes, I think odds close overwhelming big pile health-care paper wind there—won't anything close Weiner's single-payer dream, role framing terms discussion salutary. In non-obvious ways, could argue it's essential. I confess outset I long-standing soft spot Weiner, I first met twenty years ago, budding Chuck Schumer protégé played Capitol Hill softball team. Weiner strikingly similar Weiner now: amped-up, ambitious, wicked smart, forever gauging angles, unafraid (actually, proud being) royal pain tuchis. All qualities, words, served well wrangle health care. Weiner describes efflorescence subject matter opportunism, best sense word. "This one unusual issues really didn't mother ship directing message, created entrepreneurial environment," says. "You didn't president speaking clearly wanted. And among colleagues, weren't people jumped either comfort material weren't intimidated blowback" Weiner laughs. "Frankly, I like blowback. After thirteenth town- hall meeting, someone staff said, 'I can't tell you're sadist masochist.— Weiner right nature vacuum smartly stepped fill, least two proximate causes added list: illness death Ted Kennedy migration Hillary Clinton Senate Foggy Bottom, deprived debate would two dominant liberal protagonists. For Weiner, Clinton's absence implications carry personal twist; engaged Huma Abedin, Hillary's longtime personal aide. "It's weird irony I'm kind part family become issue," Weiner says. "If Hillary stayed Senate, I would never opening." Weiner allows he's discussed health-care battle Clinton; she's told say. But one imagines approves cleverness chutzpa he's displayed—especially drawing explicit analogy public option Medicare, equation increases support proposal among voters flushes phoniness Republican howls "government takeover" health care. And one similarly imagines Madame Secretary's chagrin watching Obama White House pursue dance-of-the-seven-veils strategy explicitly designed antithesis one employed back 1993 1994. Weiner's view administration's approach hasn't exactly approving—a point he's made abundantly consistently clear past months. On eve Obama's September speech joint session Congress, Weiner cracked "up now, messaging White House done Sybil ... They seem different perspective every couple hours." And he's apparently change heart. "The president miserable messenger large," tells me. Such criticisms haven't gone unnoticed 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, small part Weiner—in testament consistency, lunacy, inability shut up, three—hasn't shied away making directly.

They insisted working closely issues future economic regulation, bankers' bonuses, nuclear non-proliferation climate change. Brown insisted: "I say special relationship strong, continues strengthen." But Obama held bilateral meetings New York Chinese president, Hu Jintao, Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, new Japanese prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama. News five spurned approaches compounded miserable day Brown home saw parliamentary aide resign prime minister's refusal sack Lady Scotland, attorney general, fined £5,000 employing illegal immigrant, well withering attack former home secretary Charles Clarke. Stephen Hesford, Labour MP Wirral West, told Brown resignation letter: "In view, facts case matter. It principle counts, particularly time public's trust Whitehall uncertain say least. We seen accountable." Brown also savaged Charles Clarke, told Evening Standard view Brown's leadership risked letting "the whole Labour ship crash rocks May 2010 [the expected date general election] sink long time". He said hoped rumours Brown would quit would come true. "I think dignity ought look kind solution." In two interviews , Brown forced first time field questions health. "My sight deteriorating," told NBC. Asked BBC Radio 5 Live whether might quit health reasons, prime minister replied: "I healthy I fit. I run lot keep fit I continue keep fit. "I keep going. I got job do. I got work do. We got meet challenge." In speech UN, Obama promised end unilateralism marked previous Bush administration, approach saw US Britain working tandem. In remarks suggest Obama focus broadening American alliances across globe, said: "The time come world move new direction ... new era engagement based mutual interest mutual respect." Last week, White House unusually briefed Obama told B rown phone conversation disapproved release Lockerbie bomber compassionate grounds, something No 10 highlighted. Megrahi released basis three months live, received hero's welcome returned Tripoli. Brown said respected release, insisted undertakings Libyans return would low- key broken. In attempt distance Libyans, Brown moved toughen position Colonel Gaddafi Libya's leader theatrically tore UN charter address. Gaddafi said security council renamed "the terror council". Brown countered speech New York later: "I reaffirm UN charter, tear up. I call everyone support universal principles." He urged world leaders recognise next six months presented tests climate change terrorism huge banking crisis. On climate change said: "If miss opportunity protect planet, cannot hope second chance time future. There retrospective global agreement undo damage caused. This moment limit reverse climate change inflicting future generations." He added: "If poorest vulnerable going able adapt, emerging economies going embark low-carbon development paths, forest nations going slow stop deforestation, richer countries must contribute financially." No 10 denied prime minister snubbed last night. A spokesman said stories "without foundation. As said throughout week, prime minister President Obama number meetings throughout week.

Barack Obama rebuffs Gordon Brown 'special relationship' sinks new low Gordon Brown snubbed repeatedly Barack Obama trip United States, fall-out release Lockerbie bomber appeared left "the special relationship" lowest ebb nearly 20 years. By Andrew Porter, Political Editor New York Published: 11:49PM BST 23 Sep 2009 British officials made five attempts secure official talks US President even agreed policy change attempt land joint appearance two leaders, said diplomatic sources. But White House rebuffed offers Mr Brown, hoped increase popularity appearing Mr Obama, settle instead snatched conversation President New York kitchen. The setbacks led fears relati ons Downing Street White House lowest point since John Major's frosty dealings Bill Clinton. It disclosed earlier week Mr Brown would hold bilateral talks Mr Obama, despite President hosting individual meetings leaders Japan, China Russia. Downing Street claimed unusual. However, British diplomat told The Daily Telegraph White House's refusal meet Mr Brown serious embarrassment Prime Minister. "It wrong people say relaxed way things gone," source said. "There five attempts set meeting none come off." The striking example Downing Street's desperation engineer meeting change policy supplying swine flu vaccines Africa. It aimed match America's commitment announced last week. As result, hoped Mr Obama would agree joint press conference, according senior source. However, meeting never happened. The White House said Mr Brown Mr Obama would chair meeting tonight Pakistan, would "spend day Friday together." However, Friday's meeting Pittsburgh involves full G20 group world leaders. The release=2 Oof Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, appears behind new chill relations Washington London. Mr Obama expressed dismay release telephone call Prime Minister earlier month. Downing Street's original account conversation failed refer President's anger. Mr Brown maintained freeing Libyan matter entirely Scottish executive. Nearly 200 Americans died Pan Am flight 103 blown Scotland 1988. Yesterday, families victims protested UN New York Mr Brown Libya's leader, Col Muammar Gaddafi, made speeches. Last night Downing Street played suggestions rift White House pointed informal discussion Mr Brown Mr Obama climate change dinner UN Tuesday night. The 15-minute "walk chat" took place kitchen UN headquarters men left building Manhattan. No 10 maintained nothing unusual Prime Minister holding separate "bilateral" meeting President. There little doubt Mr Brown would relished high profile meeting Mr Obama. In speech United Nations, Mr Obama said world must "move new direction" "embrace20a new era engagement". That seen sign President likely place emphasis relations wide range countries rather rely old alliances. Mr Brown's increasingly poor relationship White House contrasts sharply predecessor Tony Blair, enjoyed close friendships Mr Clinton George W Bush. John Major's Tory government difficulty Mr Clinton, however, claims Mr Major tried help George Bush Snr's re-election campaign 1992 allowing researchers dig Mr Clinton's student past Oxford — something Sir John always denied. Mr Brown, whose plans lunchtime speech United Nations derailed Col Gaddafi spoke 96 minutes, faced attacks several fronts yesterday. Kathy Tedeschi Sue Kosmowski, Americans lost husbands Lockerbie bombing, travelled New York protest outside UN headquarters. They claimed Mr Brown put trade interests ahead justice victims families. The Prime Minister also accused trying appease Iran ignoring supression opposition order safeguard talks nuclear programme.

Sounds good -- copies tomorrow morning schedules.
See below. Will send PIR comments shortly. To: CDM Fr: Caitlin Re: Branch Book Overview: There surprises book. The "surprises" might exist buried took close reading pick on—the two main ones terror clause WJC's crime bill hadn't disclosed information Lewinsky (because hadn't wanted become witness her). There lot things covered My Life publications. Quite honestly book pretty boring much focused Branch I anticipated. While "and day, next day" My Life, share many elements would engage true Clinton fanatic historian. The fact appears index also makes difficult anyone looking quick hit get one. Furthermore, WJC's words interlaced Branch's recollection dictations, number direct WJC quotes far fewer I expected. HRC much player one might imagine. Her role largely seen interactions Branch recording WJC. Her statements consistent past, exception Gephardt comment, didn't grab much attention all.Ell (Others included HRC's devotion CVC, thought special prosecutor images returning meetings. They pretty much aligned interactions Branch.) Surprisingly, surprisingly, many problems discussed book those, face current Administration—Middle East peace, North Korea, China, etc... Branch repeatedly injects feelings specific subjects seems use book voice opinion Administration events time. He clearly topics prefers others (for example connection events Haiti result lot discussion it), subjects strikingly sparsely discussed Rwanda. Its absence long discussions surprising, appear thought WJC ever-dodged questions topic, weren't addressed. Much like My Life, one theme repeated WJC's conflict disdain media, especially long passages NYT Washington Post. There instances gives credit reporting, would hard-pressed find them. Additionally, numerous mentions WJC's acute allergies chronic fatigue, imagery falling asleep sessions couple occasions. The book quite bit Whitewater, given dearth public documentation little Branch could write hadn't said. One thing I recalled D'Amato's subpoena CVC's friends, later quashed, slept HRC's Rose Law Firm records White House. Branch portray helpful distinction WJC looked Whitewater scandals. While WJC attacks Whitewater political hunt, Branch WJC saying Filegate needed separated Whitewater, legitimate inquiry. There quips could catch someone's eye, WJC referring Paula Jones "a 'new bimbo' [WJC] didn't even recognize." Branch dwell Lewinsky impeachment. With exception Bruce, Bennett Kendall, lawyers mentioned. There one passage I looking into, WJC says part reason didn't mention relationship Lewinsky first threatened jail time found lying oath told truth could become witness her. This small passage could easily missed, one important note I don't recall hearing before. (This addressed fully below.) There relationships track book others. They include WJC's relationship Gore, maps part focal point end, contentious relationship Janet Reno. The one Senator appears discussed negatively Moynihan. All three issues discussed turn below. WJC portrayed extremely loving attentive father HRC portrayed much human light books/articles covering time period, ample mention relationship CVC images affection WJC, pre- post-impeachment. On foreign relations lot time spent discussing Middle East, Northern Ireland, Balkans, China, Russia, Pakistan/India beginning book, Haiti. (Note: Much written Haiti Branch's experience subject.) There also fair amount discussion North Korea, nothing discussed past weeks. Bin Laden discussed seems track mention My Life, seems detail background book. In certain cases detail My Life, example trip Pakistan WJC wrote USSS cancelled one stop would "defenseless" flying in, whereas Brach writes streets would lined "assassins." There candid looks WJC's take certain people relationship some, Albright Berger's dislike Holbrooke, detailed depiction Yeltsin's drinking, yelling outside Blair House cab get pizza. One thing note, often times WJC seems speaking Branch intentionally without recorders going, Branch writes interactions exchanges nonetheless. Such case HRC's Gephardt comment. The following items addressed memo: Wen Ho Lee Terror Clause Crime Bill 4 WJC Lewinsky's Silence 4 HRC Kissinger 4 HRC gay/lesbian 5 Tension Moynihan 5 HRC World Player 5 Jesse Jackson 6 Tension Janet Reno 6 Portrayal Carter 7 Relationship Gore 8 Other (This includes: Maggie recommending Panetta, HRC Haiti Invasion, ITAV co-author flap, Subpoenas CVC's Friends, Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex, Gore/HRC ticket, WJC suggesting Rubin run Senate, Trip South Asia) 11 Wen Ho Lee Terror Clause Crime Bill In discussing Wen Ho Lee's release Branch characterizes WJC's lack knowledge strained interpretation anti-terrorist provisions crime bill arbitrary detentions "confession." My Life mentions Lee's accusation passing discuss Lee. Below two passages Branch's book first giving context second Terror Clause Crime Bill. ➢ The year closed spies terrorism. The Justice Department, fierce debate among security agencies, indicted nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee fifty-nine counts copying classified material personal computer. Lee handled like radioactive espionage defendant—no bail, lockdown, solitary confinement—even though long dragnet produced evidence offered secrets China anyone else. The president said experts telling worst spies sometimes stored treason rainy day. This sounded fishy me. Clinton shrugged. Nothing would please establish Lee's innocence. [Branch, 577] ➢ While Lee indicted, Branch writes WJC noted others "were held secret, uncharged untried...He [WJC] embarrassed sponsored measure law without foreseeing arbitrary detentions...Under terrorist act, prosecutor decide within legal limit...whether bring charges testimony secret informant otherwise. To dismay, Clinton learned defendants held incommunicado six months. One extreme detention last three years. 'I think it's wrong,' [WJC] said. 'It's American. We accept guilty people street enjoy protect freedom.' [Branch, 629] WJC Lewinsky's Silence Branch writes part WJC's motive discussing happened Lewinsky could send jail, denied it. ➢ "Also, pointed Starr threatening jail Lewinsky year sworn denial affair. If Clinton come forward anything relationship, said Starr could turned witness Lewinsky, betraying discreet silence. Such subtleties, original, struck tendentious. The president never claimed chivalry real motive steadfast denial, dispute essential truth Lewinsky's account." [Branch, 511] HRC Kissinger The following could fodder people want continue string along notion channeling Eleanor Roosevelt. ➢ There passage HRC describes exchange Kissinger dinner complained health care bill passed wouldn't able see doctor. She continued say "it interesting, fact, dreamed Kissinger nights before. His visage turned suddenly effervescent banquet, announcing gladly worries Clinton health care bill dying. 'Oh, no, Dr. Kissinger,' replied coolly. 'Don't sure it's dead. We'll keep fighting, there's always light end tunnel.' She said Kissing blanched, speechless deft reminder Vietnam War...Now last, Hillary's dream, registered strategic designs spewed carnage venom seven needless years...'That's I dreamed,' Hillary repeated, lost thought. 'You know, I always get revenge dreams, never real life.' [Branch, 179] HRC gay/lesbian Writing call HRC NYS, Branch recalls WJC's counsel got "exercised." WJC left room. "He subdued return. 'You know, I've lot contact gay people life Hillary.' He sighed. Her temperament conservative, religious core, formed homosexual issues even mentionable. New York politics tough crucible, unsure heat could take. On hand, personal experience could speed adaptation." [Branch, 551] Tension Moynihan There several occasions throughout book Branch recalls WJC's grievances frustration Moynihan. For example: > When Moynihan called international arms embargo unilaterally lifted Bosnia could fight themselves, Branch writes, "The president flinched I mentioned [it]...'That's freebie him,' snapped Clinton, 'and knows it.'" [p.140] > In regard health care: "Echoing comments Hillary dinner, [WJC] faulted Senator Moynihan aimless hearings conducted without strategy theme." [p.170] ➢ Discussing Independent Counsel: "She [HRC] especially scornful Democrats, quoted number them. Senator Moynihan, instance, publicly said Clintons nice people sure nothing hide. 'Why investigation?' often asked. She said Moynihan skated blithely surface, never produced results Congress, could withstand scrutiny five minutes, living apartment secured chairmanship Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation." [Brach, 182] ➢ "Donnybrook" argument Moynihan said fundraising speech WJC gave citing regretted hypothetical controversial decision. Moynihan told press, "He doesn't understand...that he's conceding principles." WJC confronted lack context given statement press said Moynihan knew "feeding beast hostile presumption Clinton's motives." [Branch, 299] HRC World Player There several images HRC player world stage, WJC own. Several examples follow: ➢ Middle East: Discussing peace King Hussein: "They retreated lunch two couples—the Clintons, king wife, Queen Noor—in family dining room... Their agenda delicate race Hussein's failing health desire make peace Israel. The president said Hillary pounded away symptoms national estrangement: closed boarders, water disputes, travel barriers, war grievances, contested airspace, sealed electrical grids, on. Hussein gave feast goodwill without commitment point." [Branch, 170] > South Asia: Regarding trip South Asia CVC 1995, "Her [HRC's] schedule far demanding ceremonial, pushing conflict resolution civic empowerment downtrodden women." [Branch, 236] Later Branch tells Benazir Bhutto praising CVC HRC. "By contrast superficial American press, portrayed Hillary demure tourist policy significance exotic Asia, Bhutto said touched essential political chords whirlwind encouragements citizenship groups small-scale economic development." (The note contrasting Bhutto corresponds NYT article Branch quotes footer saying, "she [HRC] played traditional role First Lady wife mother...") [Branch, 246] > China Speech: Branch outlines HRC felt speech needed bigger China depicted "harsh reality everywhere" China Africa. He cites WJC commenting rave reviews HRC's speech. [Branch, 289] ➢ Regarding Russian financial system meltdown, Branch writes "Yeltsin seemed removed urgent political tasks Clintons counseled directly." [Branch, 512-513] Jesse Jackson Branch writes Jesse Jackson calling CVC Lewinsky story broke continued contact throughout period. WJC thanks support CVC. This goes detail WJCs gratitude, fact Jackson "counseled" CVC public knowledge dating back least 1999. ➢ "But Jesse done something would forget. When Lewinsky news broke, called Chelsea Stanford. Jesse nonfamily adult cell phone number. How got another story. Jesse said knew terrible her. Nothing like ever happened American politics. He know everything involved, wanted remind Chelsea much parents loved her. Their family needed stick together all, needed counsel, rage, pray, always available." [Branch, 497] Tension Janet Reno Throughout book, nomination her, WJC portrayed opinion negative opinion Janet Reno. > "He complained Janet Reno—made clear, fact, felt alienated attorney general. If removed her, however, pending decision yet another special prosecutor [for 1996 campaign finance] would fall Reno's deputy, Jamie Gorelick, who, Clinton feared, may share Reno's wholesale devotion outside control case president may become target...If removed Reno Gorelick, start fresh, would touch firestorm protest like Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre Justice Department officials Watergate scandal. That option." [Branch, 388-389] > Branch writes WJC talking Reno Louis Freeh disregarding letter D'Amato continuing allow independent counsel go Ciseneros. The held true Mike Espy. Branch outlines meeting WJC Reno. Reno made public statements "desire stay job. 'I told I didn't like one damn bit,' president said tersely. 'I didn't hire work New York Times Washington Post. I hired work me.'" [Branch, 398] He continues outline Clinton give Reno credit good achievements including coordination U.S. attorneys didn't blame special prosecutor Whitewater, "he blame abdicating responsibility supervise investigations ever since, letting mandates multiply almost will. She accepted criteria ludicrous crassly partisan. Reno failed defend presidency itself—not Clinton personally, institution—and extension entire executive branch...He told clue meant. His advisers considered naïve upright, fuzziness distinction seemed save her." [Branch, 399] He cites Clinton warned prepare staying job entire second term. Portrayal Jimmy Carter There parallels could drawn WJC/BHO Carter/WJC terms Carter's trip North Korea mission went Haiti. WJC clearly frustrated Carter's seeming desire front lines. North Korea: ➢ "On North Korea, [WJC] said Jimmy Carter initiated recent trip call Al Gore, Clinton approved volunteer mission break North Korea's extreme isolation... Sure enough, Carter reach North Korean dictator Kim Il-sung, proposed allow inspection North Korea's nuclear facilities exchange relief harsh economic sanctions. The hitch Carter announced terms CNN became official, adding gratuitously never agreed sanctions first place. News stories White House seething, Clinton made light spat. He said deal since ratified exchange letters, believe Carter would criticize official policy 'if game still doubt.' [Branch, 162] Haiti: ➢ After pushing sent Haiti enlisting Colin Powell Sam Nunn get WJC break Gore (who said Carter shouldn't trusted second time) Christopher approve mission Haiti seek truce junta, Carter portrayed acting stubbornly 'clientitis' (arguing acceptance Haitian generals versus United States' best interest). He didn't want leave WJC told to. Like North Korea, Carter again, Carter went press first. "The three negotiators flew back Washington late Sunday, Carter, invited stay White House, called CNN's Judy Woodruff midnight arrange interview next morning reported Clinton mission. This conduct, president said tersely, right...The press full retrospective stories friction three prominent negotiators...He said current newsweeklies lapped criticism Carter embarrassment Clinton...Many advisers griped Jimmy Carter thought still president, Clinton found criticism jaundiced. Carter spoken restraint joint press conference, allowed, exhibiting keen political ear...To Clinton, Carter simply felt earned right speak mind international statesman, even mission accepted United States government complete Air Force jet. This sense entitlement could make Carter thorn, Clinton thought value far outweighed political annoyance. He considered Carter sterling ex- resident." [Branch, 200-201] Dispatch Bombers Near Iraq ➢ "He expected military strikes win bipartisan assent, including former presidents Ford, Reagan Bush. 'Dole support me,' said. 'Carter probably criticize me. Carter always criticizes, doesn't much positive say." [Branch, 518] Gore For majority book, little discussion WJC Gore's relationship. There places briefly mentioned couple scenes levity. The end, however, describes seemingly brutally candid conversation two 2000 election impeachment. ➢ On page 92 Branch writes, "No, [Clinton] ask Gore take failed foreign policy, alleged, improve public presentations troika 'bad talkers': shy National Security Adviser Tony Lake, boring Secretary State Warren Christopher, disorganized Defense Secretary Les Aspin." [Branch, 92] ➢ In one-passage WJC talks asking Gore lead independent review Hazel O'Leary also Gore substitute economic conference Japan. The latter fare well nations offended Gore, WJC attended. Gore insisted WJC needed go Japan redeem administration absence. Gore pointed days January, WJC "pronounced vital Chelsea's schoolwork. Gore blinked. So what?...Mutual exasperation spiked. `Al,' Clinton told him, 'I going Japan leave Chelsea take exams.' Gore erupted. He thought Clinton lost bearing. They big fight, said president, still wrangling dates Japan." Branch states fight wound around time WJC saw Lewinsky. [Branch, 316-317] ➢ On page 396-397 scene, shows Gore's sense humor Gore, WJC, et al working team secure Cabinet second term. ➢ Later passage exchange WJC HRC Gore trying hire second criminal lawyer. HRC already knew paying first one $30,000 per month. The conversation leak offer Jim Neal TN, former Watergate prosecutor defend Gore free. The exchange ethics offer leak press Gore. ➢ On Gore's announcing campaign. "The president called twice congratulate Gore kickoff events—once Geneva, hours later Paris. Clinton thought glitches technical... But Gore got big things right. His twofold message perfect: distinguish Clinton's personal flaws, tell voters exactly would White House. The president said fine Gore call Clinton's affair Monica Lewinsky 'inexcusable.' First, true. Second, showed necessary strength criticized boss. Third, Gore would badgered death did. 'Al,' Clinton told him, 'if thought would help campaign, I would let flog noon right doorstep Washington Post.'" [Branch, 553-554] Branch continues WJC told Gore ignore reporting offended critical campaign. "On tape, president said confided chief strategic worry Gore Gore's pollster, Mark Penn. The vice president must project platform—where stood, precisely would lead country—because Republicans would try knock substance." [Branch, 554] ➢ WJC offered critiques Gore's campaign throughout, always framed fear Gore succeeding him. For example, "Clinton still thought Gore could win. Most people considered smart, experience, motivated. He examined pitfalls Gore campaign showcasing presidential character detailed agendas country. Reporters called Gore "stiff," Clinton discounted liability. He thought Gore's droll sense humor would wear well time. Gore also perceived conventional Democrat, therefore lacking independence, called Gore emphasize passion initiatives. Then president said Gore could brooding quality him, worrisome off-putting itself, potentially damaging serious nature failed give voters lifted. Clinton isolated word "sunny." Gore needed it." [Branch, 599] ➢ He also complimented Gore's knowledge government workings. "Gore knew Washington. Believe me, said president, administration would made many errors first two years vice president." He goes say WJC suggested Gore find someone would bright spot run with, perhaps Durbin Bradley Kerrey, although also goes great detail virtues Mikulski, even though would never get chosen. How much WJC's emphasis versus Branch's focus home state senator unclear. [Branch, 599, 618-19] ➢ WJC criticized Gore running successes administration. "They running essentially third term, said president, afraid Clinton-Gore record would tarnish Clinton's character." [Branch, 623] Branch gives WJC's critique Gore debate heard before—that Gore lacked style light touch. ➢ Branch WJC recalling conversation WJC Gore "Gore bared one stressful consultations insisting he, Gore, good politician, elaborating meant good policy, also good politics, admitted instinctively blend two. Gore said think it, Clinton thought pretty close bone...He stuff great president, message Clinton must convey somehow without seeming brag record." [Branch, 623-624] ➢ The big passage Gore begins page 641 extends 645. Branch notes WJC unsure first recording details. At outset says, "For part, Gore angry, blame Clinton defeat, wanted acknowledge forthrightly people around did." [Branch, 642] It WJC acknowledging Gore's use proper—he best White House. Then says, "'I think made mistake use last ten days,'" Clinton told Gore, 'but otherwise big deal. I much upset message, we're honest.'" [Branch, 642] Branch recalls WJC saying Gore fought bag saying "Clinton's drag plagued every direction." Clinton said Gore better governance Clinton, Gore would better nation Bush, "unparalleled" vice president, "blind spots." Branch writes WJC kept saying confrontation "surreal." o Gore "fresh grievance...he wanted Clinton know Buddhist temple fund-raising scandal worst experience life. No one ever questioned personal integrity, corrosive publicity whispers tormented four years. Gore said disposed blame Clinton. However, remembered telling president found English-speaking person one Asian fund-raisers. And president charge party apparatus supposed screen donations trouble. So blame Clinton way. The president told could scarcely believe ensuing tales suspicion. Gore must still shock election, unhinged. 'I thought Neverland,' said." [Branch, 643-644] o Branch continues: "The vice president asked Clinton Monica Lewinsky. He supported Clinton impeachment, publicly privately, declaring disappointed. Yes, said president. He appreciated that. However, persisted Gore, Clinton confide personal feelings. He never explained exactly happened. There little say, Clinton replied, beyond failure regret. He humiliated angry, made mistake. He misled American people, sorry. Gore closed point emphasis. Well, said, first time apologized personally. Clinton double take...Gore treated confession watershed. Their colliding perspectives made angry. Clinton exploded Gore's reaction phony. What significant here?...Gore exploded back. He feeling stubborn repeat defensiveness delayed honesty somehow cost election. Clinton's character root it..." [Branch, 644-45] Other ➢ Maggie Person Recommending Panetta: Unlike My Life, Branch's book, WJC asking Maggie compile confidential suggestions McLarty's replacement. "Williams shrewd, discreet, efficient." [Branch, 161] > HRC Haiti Invasion: Branch asked WJC HRC thought foreign policy team's suggestion invade Haiti. "He said pell-mell rush invade crazy her. Reacting pressure, lack options, sense trapped, said badly served foreign policy staff. He said observed suspicion chief sponsors invasion—Lake, Berger, Talbott—were people pushed ill-fated appointment Bobby Ray Inman defense secretary." [Branch, 189] > ITAV: ITAV co-author flap Sally Quinn spread rumors HRC written book. Quinn said HRC denied credit book's collaborator, Barbara Feinman, friend Quinn.

The Senate Judiciary Committee last week reviewing amendment Sen. Richard Durbin (D-I11.) USA Patriot Act clarify legal standard needed investigation act. The amendment intended provide greater protections abuse investigators. His colleague, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), spoke opposition, agreeing committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) ranking Republican Jeff Sessions (Ala.) additional protections needed. "I would point actual language here," Klobuchar said, "which is, it's like pie-in- the-sky standard here. I mean, specifically says," noted approvingly, reading aloud bill, "reasonable grounds believe information sought relevant authorized national security investigation," can't investigate someone exercising free speech rights there's got suspected foreign agent involved. "So I just, anyone listening this, like standard," concluded. "There standard place here." "That's standard bill now?" Sessions asked. Klobuchar nodded was. No it's not, Durbin interrupted. "Senator Klobuchar, read amendment," bill, said -- "and I think it's critically important understand we're establishing here." Whatever. Klobuchar voted amendment, got handful votes anyway. Blame gatekeeper The usual pattern State Department new secretary arrives Foggy Bottom first day work enters rousing cheers career Foreign Service folks hoping new boss actually heed expert advice. (They are, nature, optimistic crowd.) Then, 7 months, 8 days 12 hours, average, grumbling begins secretary "not accessible" senior career folks, she's overly protected personal staff, promised "open door" slammed shut. The fingers start pointing, usually secretary's chief staff. These days, that's Cheryl Mills, holds post Secretary State Hillary Rodham Clinton. We're hearing complaints even members inner circle overworked Mills -- chief staff, counselor, overseer Haiti policy food security policy department motor pool (okay, really) -- made entry Clinton's suite something like penetrating Green Zone Baghdad. Not so, says Undersecretary State William Burns, department's top career official. "This secretary touch every day many people across department possible, Cheryl big part making happen."

sbwhoeop Monday, November 2, 2009 6:23 PM H FYI: When chance, re: Wm. Hague told you, relevant undercurrent EU debate. Sid FrsOrn The Times November 3, 2009 I suggest night theatre, Mr Cameron A sop party's Europhobes left Conservative leader defending indefensible. He ashamed David Aaronovitch On Friday morning David Cameron called upon David Miliband apologise. On Friday evening I went see play. The play Our Class, Polish playwright, Tadeusz Slobodzianek. In series short "chapters" Slobodzianek followed group classmates small Polish village 1925 2002. Like village, class half Catholic half Jewish. In 1941, Germans replaced Russians occupiers, almost Jews area murdered single day. Slobodzianek shows led massacre happened afterwards. It unbearable. Though village named play, based real events took place Jedwabne July 10, 1941. As Poland's Institute National Memory concluded 2002, day 40-50 Jewish men forced parade around town singing songs, led barn outskirts where, one one, killed knives, axes cleavers thrown pit. Then 300 women children led town square barn locked inside. Kerosene poured roof walls set alight. The screams could heard two kilometres away; one survived. In 2001 finally acknowledged many people known along. The murderers hadn't Germans, local Poles, depicted Our Class. Alexander Kwasniewski, Polish President, apologised dead Jews survivors ceremony Jedwabne "in name, name Poles whose conscience shattered crime". History matters. Few believe much Law Justice party Michel Kaminski, leads Tory-backed group European Parliament. The party's leaders demanded apologies Russians massacre 21,000 Polish officers Katyn 1940 references terrible Polish historical suffering constituted big part, political appeal. But despite historical sensitivity Mr Kaminski, MEP Jedwabne area, support 2001 apology. He opposed vigorously, associating "Committee Defend .Good Name Jedwabne". Among leading members local priest, Edward Orlowski, — asked journalists whether would attending ceremony President apologised — said: "These lies. business. Germans responsible, apologiSe?" Mr Kaminski developed slightly different rationale. As told interviewer far-right newspaper, Our Poland, murders — abhorred — work outcasts, would apologise someone "from Jewish side" apologised "the Jews" behaved Soviet occupation 1939 1941. Last month Mr Kaminski (who denied giving interview) confirmed position. "If asking Polish nation apologise crime made Jedwabne," said, "you would require whole Jewish nation apologise Jewish communists Eastern Poland." It argument incenses me,•as would anyone, I think, sat Our Class. The idea collective Jewish Bolshevism major anti-Semitic trope war; major element self-justification it. Mr Kaminski denied apology, denied need it, equated massacre "Jewish actions" allied denied massacre altogether, fulfilling historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet's observation patterns massacre denial: "it never happened, happened justified, themselves, us." Mr Kaminski's view described disgraceful Mr Miiiband. Having read enormous amount Jedwabne last weeks, I think Mr Miliband completely right — disgraceful. And might well demand Mr Cameron: "I apologise?" But that, I find amazed Mr Cameron ever came position demanding foreign secretary, descended Polish Jews, apologise possibly offending sensibilities foreign politician vehemently opposed apology massacre Polish Jews. I think things Mr Cameron got right leadership the. Conservatve Party mental jaw drops sheer wrongness it. Now Tory columnists, bioggers activists devoting time nitpicking sophistry nature collective guilt, attacking non-existent "smears" say attached unlovely person Mr Kaminski. Why? It true, embattled Conservatives argued, many grand European coalitions contain people whose history problematic. There odds sods big conservative grouping, EPP, socialist group. But personalities far outweighed parties IVIerkels Sarkozys. The Polish member EPP, example, ruling free-market, non-nationalist conservative party Donald Tusk — almost certainly party Mr Cameron would join Pole. The new Tory grouping, European Conservatives Reformists, contrast, odds sods continental Cameron would certainly shun, bar one organisation — British Conservatives. So get position explain Latvian SS wasn't bad really, Mr Kaminski understandable position collective guilt? And answer seems Mr Cameron promised Europhobes leadership campaign back 2005 would leave "federalist" EPP, logical outcome move weird alliance finds defending. Was necessary? No. Was Britain's interests? Absolutely not. interests progressive Conservatism? You must joking. So happened Mr Cameron doesn't really care enough Europe think consequences lightly given promises, he's much Euro-nutter sects, Hannanites, Cashists Redwoodians? This kind advice I loathe, I'll say anyway. Go see Our Class, Mr C. This one hole don't want keep digging.

Speaking Guardian, Pierre Lellouche, France's Europe minister, described "pathetic" Tories' EU plans announced today, warning would succeed "for minute". Giving vent frustration across EU, so'far expressed private, Lellouche — said reflecting Nicolas Sarkozy's "sadness regret" — accused William Hague, shadow foreign secretary, "bizarre autism" discussions. He said: "They one line repeat one line. It bizarre sense autism." Lellouche, one Anglophile members Sarkozy's government, made remarkable intervention David Caii.e.con outlined fresh Tory approach EU wake full ratification Lisbon treaty. A future Conservative government would seek strengthen British sovereignty repatriate series powers Over social employment legislation, Tory leader said. Cameron said seeking immediate "bust-up" EU, would allow repatriation powers negotiations last long five years. But position enough Tory MEP Daniel Hannan, quit role party's legal affairs spokesman Europe, saying intended fight referendums enable Britain become "self-governing". France's centre-right government condemned Cameron's plans, saying would marginalise Britain within EU. Abandoning diplomatic niceties, Lellouche said: "It's pathetic. It's sad see Britain, important Europe, cutting rest disappearing radar map .... This culture opposition ... It result long period opposition. I know come back, I hope trip short." He said Cameron's approach line Tories' decision abandon main centre-right EPP grouping European parliament, Sarkozy's UMP party member. "They done European parliament. They essentially castrated UK influence European parliament," said. Lellouche said told Hague personally position "waste time us". "I told William Hague: go away two three years, political economic situation you're going self you'll come back. Go ahead it. That message ... You want marginalised? Well, go it. But it's waste time us," French minister said. Lellouche made clear Tories hope securing support plans. "It's going happen minute. Nobody going indulge rewriting [treaties for] many, many years. Nobody going play institutions again. It's going take leave honest say that," said. "It time tumultuous waters around us. Wars, terrorism, proliferation, Afghanistan, energy Russia, massive immigration, economic crisis. It time destiny Europe defined — whether exist third world's GDP capable fighting climate, trade, every ... issue surface Earth. "We need united, otherwise wiped marginalised. None us alone. Whether you're big small, lessbn same. And [Britain's] risk one marginalisation. Irrelevance." He explained: "Finally institutional package, took 15 years looking navel getting everybody bored death sterile debate". In sign France's determination resist Tory plans opt key EU legislation, Lellouche warned French would attempt reduce Britain's EU budget rebate negotiation next parliament. He pointed France net EU contributor tune €5bn (E4.5bn), unlike Britain receives rebate. "If get government ferociously anti European vote kind legislation I think relationship going difficult. As enter next phase one issues discuss midterm course finances. France net contributor tune €5bn year, €1.5bn British rebate. That tell quite bit huh?" said. Cameron angered attack, implies Tory relations rest Europe although short term concerned ensure strategy abandoning referendum Lisbon treaty provoke cries, betrayal backbenches. Hague reacted French criticism insisting Lellouche's comments represent true reception Tories' plans Europe. "That seen across Europe," told BBC2's Newsnight, adding party established good relations Sarkozy's party. "1 don't think find that's representative reaction Paris European capitals," added.

The answer, course, no, riot geography. Two veteran intelligence operatives much Middle Eastern Afghan experience, speaking attribution, agreed stable, secure Afghanistan doesn't change equation, least significantly. The popular perception al-Qaida Afghanistan propaganda news clip, shown gazillion times last eight years, replete terrorist "trainees" shalwar-kameez (knee-length shirts baggy pantaloons) running obstacle courses emerging tunnels, presumably kill us beds. Al-Qaida doesn't need commando-steeled volunteers attack United States allies. For next Sept. 11, chances already selected highly motivated, brainwashed wackjobs among graduates Pakistan's madrassas, look forward one button push land plenty sky 72 impatient maidens await arrival. Al-Qaida's "martyrs" don't need Afghan training camps WMD terrorism. In fact, inconspicuous, physique avoid-at-all-cost likely arouse suspicion. Al-Qaida need Afghanistan next terrorist objective. In fact, follow events Afghanistan closely taken aback Obama said Afghanistan war necessity that's al-Qaida. is. They haven't since Afghanistan liberated October 2001. They moved Pakistan's tribal areas attracted volunteers Middle East Europe. When reconstituted Taliban insurgent force re-entered Afghanistan large numbers 2004, al-Qaida interested insecure old training camps. Even Pakistan's current offensive.against Taliban al-Qaida tribal areas successful, al-Qaida entity captured destroyed. Its clandestine operatives widely scattered Middle East, Africa, Europe, North South America. As alternatives Afghanistan Pakistan, Yemen, vernacular intelligence community, do/is it. Somalia do/is it. West African states whose writ doesn't extend much beyond capitals do/are it. Grimy North African suburbs major French cities do/are it. British provincial towns Pakistani enclaves do/are it. And Internet's thousands pro-al-Qaida Web sites do/are it. Osama bin Laden deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri believed comfortably installed tribal chiefs compound somewhere near Quetta, capital Pakistan's constantly rebellious Baluchistan province, 48 percent country's land with. 10 million 175 million people. There al-Qaida central issuing orders thousands adherents world over. If the:re connection Afghanistan core problem "no Sept. lls," United States 41 friendly nations there? Even event Taliban victory years come, Taliban would stupid enough invite al-Qaida back. Three months prior Sept. 11, 2001, palpable tension Taliban leader Mullah Omar bin Laden. Omar complained bin Laden issuing "too many fatwas (religious edicts) business didn't complete religious education." Omar also prevented journalists seeing bin Laden. The Taliban leader knows lost power country bin Laden terrorists United States. In today's Afghanistan almost everything turns corruption mismanagement. The average citizen seen little benefit expenditures $250 billion range -- top $1 trillion Iraq. The .U.S. effort plagued fraud, laced mismanagement bereft strategic focus. One example among many others came 2007 United States awarded massive contract worth $300 million A:EY, Florida-based company, supply Afghan army 52 types ammo, chiefly bullets AK-47s. All requirements safety inspections, mandatory ammo delivered U.S. forces, removed. Thus AEY able shop around Eastern Europe cheapest ammo available. Millions rounds old Chinese ammo made 1960s turned substandard. dangerous. The State Department aware going object speed criterion. AEY officers eventually indicted Florida. But U.S. officials involved got slap wrist. Wherever U.S. inspectors look, find fraud abuse. There even cases -- reported GlobalPost reporter Jean Mackenzie -- American contractors paying bribes Taliban ensure aid projects disrupted. This recipe war without end. She also reports disguised Taliban office Kabul reviews aid projects determines amount paid Taliban. If true, United States paying Afghan government fight Taliban also paying Taliban fight Afghan government. The key lies Pakistan. Almost terrorist trails Europe lead back Pakistan -- madrassas. These free Koranic schools stepped vacuum education system poor military takes 50 percent government revenue. A fraction United States spent Iraq Afghanistan would go long way turning Pakistan around. Instead, Congress, infinite wisdom, authorizing $1.2 trillion wars allocated $7.5 billion Pakistan five years -- umpteen caveats. In country 175 million, drop proverbial bucket.

When policy abandoned September, Jeremy Hunt, shadow Culture Secretary, said enacting might make commercial television companies "focus attracting viewers attracting subsidies". There gain BBC climbdown, David Cameron already said Tories freeze licence fee. What mean BBC's income capped, without regional television companies seeing government help, strengthen market position Britain's satellite television company, Sky. "This done News International," Tory insider said yesterday. "Murdoch wants Sky go head head BBC. He doesn't want independent companies strengthened." In April 2008, James Murdoch complained bitterly media regulator Ofcom first major speech taking chief executive News Corporation Europe Asia.

Lord Mandelson alleged yesterday Conservatives News International "effectively formed contract, head, incidentally, newspaper's editor readers, sort bound one another". Speaking BBC's Today programme, added: "What The Sun Conservatives election one part contract and, presumably, Conservatives News International elected side bargain. But wider question. When The Sun creates news way, followed Sky News, puts pressure BBC follow suit." This "absolutely, categorically" denied yesterday The Sun's political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, accused Lord Mandelson talking "preposterous nonsense".

But signs yesterday attack may rebounded The Sun. Mr Brown, blind one eye, admitted handwriting bad apologised Mrs Janes, whose 20-year-old son, Jamie, killed makeshift bomb Afghanistan last month. A poll yesterday website PoliticsHome, whose main shareholder Conservative Party deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft, found 65 per cent polled thought The Sun's attack "inappropriate" compared 23 per cent thought "legitimate". The closeness new Tory-Sun axis shown revelation, inside source, David Cameron personally consulted editor The Sun, Dominic Mohan, three separate conversations abandoned "cast-iron" promise hold referendum Lisbon Treaty, 27 members states EU ratified it.

Sid Return Article November 13, 2009 Can Clinton Coalition Survive Obama? By Sean Trende John Judis Ruy Teixeira's well-regarded 2002 work The Emerging Democratic Majority begins vignette set Virginia. They tell story telecom executive named Mark Warner, runs moderate campaign appeals upper-middle class suburbanites working class rural voters, manages put together winning coalition that, imitated states, might put Democrats power decades come. Democrats build coalitions similar Warner's, fact better part decade. Warner's coalition essentially Bill Clinton's 1996 coalition. The coalition brand Clinton built extraordinarily successful one Democrats, breaking momentum resurgent GOP 1996, ultimately enabling election liberal President American History last year. Given background, it's appropriate first tangible sign coalition coming unglued come Virginia. Republican Bob McDonnell won governorship almost 59% vote — highest percentage (though highest victory margin) governor since 1961. The entire Republican ticket won similar margins, GOP picked six seats General Assembly. It could even worse — five Democrats won Assembly races fewer 1,000 votes. There superficial lessons drawn here. After last week's election, it's silly argue GOP brand damaged take advantage Democratic weakness. And Democrats' latest spin — weakness among Independents simply function Republicans calling independents retaining Republican voting habits — puts lie argument Republicans' low self-identification salient factor elections. But important lesson this: there's little predictive value off-year elections, provide snapshots mood electorate, present state political coalitions. Given Virginia's primacy story Democratic coalition building, gives us good snapshot state coalition. And it's pretty one Democrats. The historical base Democratic Party two centuries long Jay Cost I call Jacksonians: Culturally conservative, hawkish, populist whites located throughout South Border states. They began breaking away Democrats 1950s 1960s — reaction Party's embrace unions, blacks liberals story well known there's need rehash here. But group remained least play Democrats. Clinton inherited coalition consisting minorities, liberals, urban voters, decent remnant Jacksonian voters Ohio River Valley South, still preferred moderate-to-conservative Democrat Republican. This coalition became majority coalition Clinton used combination fiscal conservatism social moderation bring suburban voters board. This huge innovation Democrats; suburbs like Nassau County, NY, Orange County, CA Fairfax County, VA fueled rise Republican parties states. Clinton moved substantially toward side. This coalition allowed win eight points 1996; absent Perot last-minute fundraising scandal, probably would won more. Clinton intuited suburban voters are, generally speaking, culturally cosmopolitan — don't like call someone "macaca," aren't crazy religious right. But they're generally particularly socially liberal either, fans "law order." They like taxes low appreciate economic growth, like good schools clean environment. Having balance bunch spending priorities somewhat limited income daily lives, balanced budgets ultimate "good government" indicator voters. Clinton delivered issues, keeping tax increases fairly small, balancing budget much term. In — important — re-branded Democrats party fiscal responsibility, economic growth, moderate taxes, smart government. In words, finally shed "Carter" label Democrats. This, turn, made plausible much liberal heirs benefit presumption competence Democrats - one probably would enjoyed without him. George W. Bush's presidency, turn, upper-middle class suburbanite's nightmare. An aggressive social agenda, fiscal trainwreck, two poorly-managed wars financial collapse later, suburban voters trended even heavily Democratic Clinton era. By 2008, Democrats held suburban districts around , major metropolitan areas, threatening exurbs. The right Democratic candidate probably could put together massive 2008 Presidential majority, combining minorities, liberals, Jacksonians, Catholics, suburbanites. The mood country certainly right 1920/1932/1952/1980 result. But Democrats nominated Barack Obama. The party's grip among Jacksonians weakened since Clinton left stage, abandoned Obama completely. Jay Cost I detailed here. This movement Obama received 53% vote, instead 60% might expect given voters' attitude toward Bush's Presidency. Obama able win even without branch Democratic party generated intensity among remaining portions base. In words, base wasn't broad Clinton's, deeper. Faced vanishing 401ks home values, disgust Bush's presidency, suburbanites flocked him. Liberals enthralled finally elect one own. And minorities turned heavily opportunity elect first black President. But presents problem. You get elect first black President once, governing coalition suburbanites, poor blacks, upper class liberals isn't easy. It hard keep enthusiasm up. And Jacksonian wing party gone, enthusiasm dissipates, one coalition groups becomes disgruntled starts shuffle door, party isn't left much. We see microcosm story last Tuesday's elections, especially Virginia. Let's backtrack 2001, look counties Mark Warner won. The coalition Warner built similar Clinton's. To oversimplify some, blended together rural Democrats mining counties west state, college voters around Charlottesville, black voters combined rural whites south central southeastern portion state suburban voters northeast. It diverse coalition, worked. Now let's compare Warner's map Obama's map 2008: The suburbs stayed Democrat's camp, reasons discussed above. But look happens west! That area becomes solidly Republican. Buchanan Dickenson counties Virginia panhandle voted Dukakis, Mondale, Adlai Stevenson (twice). Obama became second Democrat lose counties since UMW moved 1920s. As I said, isn't problem long (1) Jacksonians show willingness come back candidate Obama and/or (2) suburbs continue love affair Democrats. But see indications Virginia Jacksonian divorce may, fact, permanent. Creigh Deeds western section state, seemed — least paper — capable remaking Mark Warner map. It didn't happen, obviously. Let's look Virginia changed Bush's 2000 election Deeds' loss last week: The redder county is, moved toward Republicans 2000 2009; bluer counties moved toward Democrats. We see McDonnell well Bush suburbs — better. Those pockets white DC suburbs northeast, Hampton Roads area southeast, Richmond north west Hampton Roads. Its rural Virginia — still 1/3 electorate — made difference Bush's 54% 2004 McDonnell's 59% Tuesday. Even Obama ticket, much less cosmopolitan figure atop ticket, rural Virginia went solidly Republican. We take another angle here. Deeds McDonnell squared close Attorney General race 2005. Let's compare Deeds' 2005 showing 2009 performance. [NOTE: In map, look "relative movement." Because everything state moved toward McDonnell, map showing "movement" would solid dark red, much use. So instead, something moved 9 points toward McDonnell, colored shade red, moved less 9 points toward McDonnell, blue. Think showing change counties' PVI]. We see result. Just since 2005, rural Virginia moved sharply Democrats. The suburbs haven't moved much all, relative rest state, heavily African American counties southern portion state moved notches leftward (in absolute terms, voted 2009 2005). This suggests lasting damage Democratic brand simply personal Obama. Now let's look McDonnell compared McCain 2008. Again, movement dramatic statewide, need isolate biggest smallest changes looking "relative" shifts. The western counties state didn't shift much 2008, that's already giving Republicans around 70% vote — wasn't much room Republican growth (and remember, "blue" relative map still means slight movement toward Republican since 2008)! The real Republican gains past year come DC exurbs, 1-95 corridor, lesser extent Hampton Roads area. In words, Jacksonians aren't returning Democrats, least Virginia. Deeds might still able win without them, Democrats also showing weakness Virginia suburbs. In words, two pieces Clinton-Warner coalition starting break away. This real problem Democrats. If suburbanites Jacksonians move away party, very, little left them. And there's reason think suburban weakness real. Obama's fiscal policy, make understatement, hasn't Clintonian. It may entirely fault, $787 billion stimulus, trillion dollar healthcare bill, automobile bailout, budget showing trillion dollar deficits extending next decade make suburbanites shudder. They don't much like debt, intuit spending going paid point — probably them. Voters still give Obama benefit doubt, Presidents first year, becoming very, worried, probably don't put much stock Candidate Obama's promise enact net spending cut more. Democrats doubtless chalk Creigh Deeds' inept campaign. Deeds wasn't great candidate, mood country starting swing party, hard run good campaign. Jerry Kilgore found ran similar environment 2005, reduced attacking Tim Kaine religious views death penalty. And run Deeds-McDonnell race 2006 2008, I think hard argue McDonnell would win 18 points, even holding everything else equal. The problem explanation saw similar results replicated around country. Most seats House Delegates Democrats lost Virginia, came close losing, suburban. The Philly suburbs voted Republican state Supreme Court. Bergen County New Jersey didn't give Republican 60% vote like 1984, Chris Christie nearly carried it, even though significantly conservative Christie Todd Whitman Tom Kean, won largest margin first-term Republican Governor since 1969. Conservative Republicans won elections Westchester County, New York, Republicans picked two City Council seats outskirts Queens. Republicans won back Nassau County legislature -- Democrats' capture body figures prominently introduction Emerging Democratic Majority -- nearly defeated Democratic County Executive obscure, underfunded candidate. In words, places never heard Creigh Deeds seen attack ads McDonell's thesis, Democrats still lost suburban voters. States Democratic base liberals, urbanites, minority voters -- like California New York -- haven't moved much Democrats. Obama's polling numbers, well Democratic candidates Governor Senator, classic "Emerging Democratic Majority" states like Colorado Nevada looking good all. And course Jacksonian states like Kentucky, he's 40%. This doesn't mean Democrats doomed 2010. An improved economy, Republican missteps, host factors could keep band together them. Maybe marginal voters Obama brought polls enact hope change return 2010 keep hope alive. But personal nature Obama's victory starting show downside downticket Democrats. The Clinton coalition looking creaky. If Obama doesn't improve coalition comes apart, Democrats could find weaker even 1980s 1990s. Sean Trende reached strende@realclearpolitics.com.

Gelb November 22, 2009 I 10:50pm The Asia trip worth Obama's time. Leslie H. Gelb president shake foreign policy team—and make sure deals done leaves home. President Obama's nine-day trip Asia worth look back fix two potent problems, past future. First, trip's limited value per day presidential effort suggests disturbing amateurishness managing America's power. On top inexcusably clumsy review Afghan policy fumbling Mideast negotiations, message Mr. Obama clear: He stare hard skills foreign-policy team and, so, dominant role decision-making. Something awry somewhere, he's got fix it. Secondly, Asia trip presented important opportunity carve new American leadership role world's dynamic economic region, Mr. Obama missed it. He scratched surface calls multilateralism mutual understanding. He needs paint pictures Washington help solve regional security trade problems. Otherwise, Asian nations continue unwanted drift toward China away United States. A meditation journey start forgetting half last week's commentary. Unbelievably, criticized Obama getting China "throw weight around." What Asian leaders want that? None I know of. Others lamented Obama couldn't make "demands" China anymore. The presumption China king, Washington longer way Beijing. The facts Washington never boss Beijing around, China ruling roost (more accurately, it's sitting eggs). Others contended Obama continued pattern trashing America's friends coddling authoritarian enemies like China. It's hard stomach nonsense conservative crowd forever praised George W. Bush accommodating China alienating America's allies. Some analysts played fair acknowledged administration officials tried tell reporters expect "deliverables" trip, see journey recognition Asia's new importance America's desire new co- operative spirit. That's commendable thought, hardly justification almost two weeks president's time (when consider preparations)— especially he's got tanking economy, health-care reform woes, decisions make Afghanistan. Presidents take trips like one need breakthroughs accomplishments certain issues can't agreed without pressure impending presidential visit. In fact, presidents wouldn't even commit trips abroad without knowing key deals would finally agreed announced visit itself. The prospective visit power jackhammer nail deals. Just take gander trips planned Richard Nixon Henry Kissinger George H. W. Bush James Baker. Obama's travels chance settle make concrete progress thorny issues like greenhouse-gas emissions, fate U.S. bases Okinawa, new Japanese government insists moving. It time announce ways gain fixes U.S.-South Korean trade treaty, long stalled Congress. It moment show Beijing would actually make mutually beneficial compromises exchange rates economic sanctions Iranian North Korean nuclear programs. Absent guarantees progress issues these, Mr. Obama taken well- deserved vacation Hawaii. Matters made worse scene. It good optics Obama bow Japan's emperor. He seems stuff spontaneously inexplicably, bow Saudi King months ago. And truly unfortunate Obama aides didn't flatly insist allowed address Chinese people directly television meet non-stacked Chinese groups—as case previous presidential visits. Beijing's leaders obviously didn't feel confident enough standing home give popular Mr. Obama access. But team made precondition visit. Its absence left unhappy taste. The Asia trip presented important opportunity carve new American leadership role world's dynamic economic region, Mr. Obama missed it. The White House might try blame State Department (such easy delicious target) missteps.

Asia overflowing multilateral organizations. Washington member key ones, like Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Asian Development Bank. But little new key groupings Shanghai Cooperation Organization (Russia, China, Uzbekistan, etc.) ASEAN, association Southeast Asian nations. Asian nations increasingly organizing groups, Washington hasn't really figured role. Most Asian nations want role prominent one—in fact, leadership position. They're afraid China, afraid China won't attentive concerns future America past. At time, don't want Washington come groupings cause problems Beijing. They want Washington figure leadership position constructed proven American ability help solve common problems common interest. They want America remember, one get things done doesn't let problems fester. That U.S. policy main missing ingredient Obama's trip.

(Protectionism, name, dismissed targeted tool ongoing policy force China revalue currency. The US without means here.) The deficit high case Republicans always attempt exploit matter number. Whether another stimulus pass Congress another matter. Still, matters short-run--and long-run--are achievable results.

Wrong. Conditions U.S. labor markets awful worsening. While official unemployment rate already 10.2% another 200,000 jobs lost October, include discouraged workers partially employed workers figure whopping 17.5%. While losing 200,000 jobs per month better 700,000 jobs lost January, current job losses still average per month rate 150,000 last recession. Also, remember: The last recession ended November 2001, job losses continued year half June 2003; ditto 1990-91 recession. So expect job losses continue end 2010 earliest. In words, unemployed looking work waiting economy turn corner, better hunker down. All economic numbers suggest take while. The jobs coming back. There's really one hope leaders turn things around: bold prescription increases fiscal stimulus another round labor-intensive, shovel-ready infrastructure projects, helps fiscally strapped state local governments provides temporary tax credit private sector hire workers. Helping unemployed extending unemployment benefits necessary sufficient; leads persistent unemployment rather job creation. The long-term picture workers families even worse current job loss numbers alone would suggest. Now way sharing pain, many firms telling workers cut hours, take furloughs accept lower wages. Specifically, fall hours worked equivalent another 3 million full time jobs lost top 7.5 million jobs formally lost. This bad news must face facts. Many lost jobs gone forever, including construction jobs, finance jobs manufacturing jobs. Recent studies suggest quarter U.S. jobs fully out-sourceable time countries. Other measures tell ugly story: The average length unemployment time high; ratio job applicants vacancies 6 1; initial claims continued claims high millions unemployed resorting exceptional extended unemployment benefits programs staying longer. Based best judgment, likely unemployment rate peak close 11% remain high level two years more. The weakness labor markets sharp fall labor income ensure weak recovery private consumption anemic recovery economy, increases risk double dip recession. As result terribly weak labor markets, expect weak recovery consumption economic growth; larger budget deficits; greater delinquencies residential commercial real estate greater fall home commercial real estate prices; greater losses banks financial institutions residential commercial real estate mortgages, credit cards, auto loans student loans thus greater rate failures banks; greater protectionist,pressures. The damage extensive severe unless bold policy action undertaken now. Roubini professor Economics Stern School Business New York University Chairman Roubini Global Economics.

sbwhoeop Tuesday, November 17, 2009 8:57 AM H FYI: Lead FT editorial today, must haven't read. Sid Financial Times FT.com OMMENT editorial US fumbling new China tone Published: November 16 2009 20:39 I Last updated: November 16 2009 20:39 Gone days US president could visit Beijing unassailable top dog, able lecture Chinese everything human rights overvalued currency. As become fashionable note, events instead obliged Barack Obama play role washed-up debtor visiting stern bank manager yet another loan. That analogy useful. But overdone. Certainly, financial crisis brought sharp relief dependent US become foreign creditors, chief among China. It also sharpened perception happening anyway, relative decline US-centric west relative rise China-centric Asia. But word relative important. China, poor riddled internal contradictions, yet, long way. The changing relationship China demand new tone. But early indications Mr Obama still fumbling right one. Take global imbalances. In set-piece speech Asian tour — delivered Japan, perhaps assure hosts Washington abandoning Tokyo yet — Mr Obama correctly pointed global economy cannot go back business usual. "One important lessons recession taught us limits depending primarily American consumers Asian exports drive growth," said. That quite right. But entreaties global rebalancing fall flat China. That partly Beijing remains publicly sceptical US's long-term finances. From China's perspective, Mr Obama's emergency measures stimulate US economy persuade Americans spend way recession smack re-creating spendthrift ways triggered crisis first place. That explains Chinese officials quizzed US counterparts robustly intend pay healthcare reform. It also Beijing started questioning US monetary, well fiscal, policy. On eve US president's visit, Liu Mingkang, China's chief banking regulator, took swipe US Federal Reserve, saying combination weak dollar low interest rates risked generating global asset bubble. That bit rich coming someone oversees banking system pumped equivalent nearly 30 per cent gross domestic product economy far year. But reflects new tone China presumes address humbled superpower. Mr Obama's efforts occupy moral high ground also undermined flirtation protectionism, particularly decision slap tariffs Chinese tyres. His administration failed spell convincing trade policy — seen stark omission for-a business- oriented Asian audience. Such perceived deficiencies hobbled ability cajole China real conviction. When comes human rights, too, US seems drawn conclusion good policy badmouth chief creditor. Hillary Clinton, secretary state, set tone early said human rights "interfere" matters implicitly greater urgency. Mr Obama obligingly omitted references Tibet, Xinjiang even Taiwan Tokyo speech. There also single mention India, potential regional counterweight China, yet another indication Washington behaving though treading eggshells. It therefore refreshing hear Mr Obama criticise Chinese censorship town hall meeting Shanghai Monday — though even could undo self-censorship refusing meet Dalai Lama week's trip. It right proper US acknowledge rising significance China. Mr Obama's assurances China's rise need threat spot on. But token, US accommodation taken far. Contrary common perception, China's huge holdings US treasuries sign great strength. They evidence dependent Chinese growth US consumer. Equally, idea China, economy less third size US GDP per capita roughly Angola's, somehow save world ludicrous. Mr Obama right show respect China. He need — must — kowtow.

Council Foreign Relations Expert Brief The U.S.-China Economic Relationship: Separating Facts Myths Steven Dunaway, Adjunct Senior Fellow International Economics Author: Former deputy director Asia Pacific department International Monetary Fund. Author Council Special Report, Global Imbalances Financial Crisis. November 16, 2009 http://www.cfr.org/publication/20757/uschina_economic_relationship.html?breadcrumb=°/02Fregion%2F271%2Fchina Many myths surround economic relationship United States China. Four, particular, stand out, important identify myths avoid misunderstandings could adversely influence policy decisions. The fact China become largest foreign holder U.S. government securities taken indicating United States heavily dependent China finance budget deficits. Similarly, since China major source U.S. imports, U.S. consumers seen dependent cheap Chinese goods. In addition, Chinese authorities emphasized strongly resist external pressures try influence policy decisions economic instability China bad, adverse implications rest world. Taken together, four myths could lead conclusion China pushed hard United States (or major countries) quickly change policies, especially exchange rate policy, facilitate rebalancing economy. But conclusion would major mistake, trip Asia, President Barack Obama needs dispel myths bring pressure bear faster economic policy changes China. This would keeping objectives dealing global imbalances laid G-20 summit Pittsburgh September 2009. Myth No. 1: Washington limited leverage China main "banker" United States China holds large amount U.S. government securities. Of China's $2.3 trillion official reserves, estimated 70 percent held U.S. dollar assets. China big customer U.S. debt, America's banker. Nor United States dependent China finance budget deficits. If China elects buy U.S. Treasuries, willing public private sector buyers, indicated strong demand securities worldwide. Although U.S. government might pay higher interest rates incentive get investors buy Treasuries event Chinese reduce demand, increase interest rates would likely small. Major consequences decision China reduce purchases U.S. Treasury securities would depend reason behind decision. It would China's best interest (and beneficial rest world well) China reduced purchases U.S. Treasuries decided stop heavily managing exchange rate allow greater flexibility currency's movements. This important policy change required China going rebalance economy able sustain rapid growth. China big customer U.S. debt, America's banker. Nor United States dependent China finance budget deficits. If instead China continues heavily manage exchange rate, build large additional amounts official reserves. If decides hold less additional reserves U.S. Treasury securities, China increase purchases assets denominated currencies, euro-denominated securities likely alternative. In circumstances, China would continue intervene exchange market, central bank buying U.S. dollars Chinese renminbi selling dollars euro acquire European assets. The result would appreciation euro. Consequently, countries Europe, United States, would probably affected China's move negative impact euro appreciation European economic activity would likely far outweigh effects United States smaller Chinese purchases Treasuries. Alternatively, China could choose start dumping stock U.S. securities. The result would appreciation major currencies (depending China would decide park reserve assets); upward pressure U.S. interest rates; possibility financial market disruptions China dumped U.S. dollar assets rapidly. However, U.S. Federal Reserve could limit rise U.S. interest rates would able ensure adequate liquidity prevent market disruptions. But decision dump Treasuries would large effect China itself. The country would incur substantial capital loss reserve assets. The Chinese authorities deeply concerned loss, unlikely decide dump U.S. assets. In fact, discussion initiated China regarding need alternative official reserve asset motivated concerns potential losses U.S. dollar holdings. Myth No. 2: The United States heavily dependent cheap Chinese goods This really true. Only roughly 15 percent U.S. imports come China. Moreover, basic types manufactured consumer goods China exports United States (clothing, textiles, footwear, toys, small appliances, etc.) imported countries could produced domestically. The prices goods could substitute products China would higher, difference costs would relatively small. Competition among producers become fiercer, result cost differentials goods China suppliers narrowing. Dependence actually runs way. China highly dependent U.S. demand products. Economic growth China heavily dependent exports. Although China able achieve 8 percent GDP growth target 2009 owing stimulus domestic demand provided government policy actions, country struggle meet objective 2010 succeeding years demand exports United States pick up. Myth No. 3: External pressure China policy changes counterproductive. The Chinese authorities stress face external pressure, tend strongly resist economic policy changes. The Chinese particular used argument try fend pressures appreciation exchange rate. While country wants appear weak susceptible external pressure, truth that, pressure, less incentive change policy. This especially true China, authorities wedded status quo past success inclined make gradual changes economic policies. Recent developments China's exchange rate illustrate point. In absence external pressure since August 2008, China reverted fixing exchange rate relative U.S. dollar. Without hard push United States bilateral multilateral basis, changes China's policies likely delayed, best interest United States rest world. Myth No. 4: Instability bad China Chinese authorities also suggested instability China bad rest world adverse effects China's growth rate. But instability (or fear instability) played big role initiating economic policy changes China. For example, concern instability arising growing gap urban rural incomes major factor behind new initiatives develop China's interior (such Develop West program) improve conditions opportunities rural population (including breaking restrictions discriminatory treatment migrant workers). Hence, China, instability necessarily bad, problem authorities. Instability China also necessarily bad rest world effect China's growth. Although China accounts significant portion world GDP growth, country generate much demand products countries given China's large trade current account surpluses. Some countries Asia commodity producers may benefiting China's strong growth, overall, providing much stimulus world economy whole, slower growth China little effect economic activity rest world. It important President Obama separate fact myth economic policy discussions Chinese authorities trip Asia build sounder relationship. The president shy away pushing Chinese hard economic reform rebalancing China's economy, done private discussions China's senior leaders. Multilateral discussions, context G-20 process, much effective forum United States take public stance China's economic policies jointly major economies. Without hard push United States bilateral multilateral basis, changes China's policies likely delayed, best interest United States rest world. It also best interest China, without shift away heavy dependence investment exports drive growth toward greater reliance consumption, China able sustain rapid economic growth development. Getting China fully realize act quickly authorities inclined considerable task United States major economies.

When racist junta seized much SCV's leadership positions, Southern Poverty Law Center released <a href=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=90 >extensive list</a> SCV officials belonged "hate groups." Lyons, key leader white supremacists took SCV, <a href=hftp://www.thenation.com/doc/20050829/blumenthal/single >harbored dreams</a> creating seemingly benign front group sophisticated version Ku Klux Klan. "I great respect Klan historically, but, sadly Klan today ineffective sometimes even destructive," Lyons told German neo-Nazi magazine 1992. "It would good Klan followed advice former Klansman Robert Miles: 'Become invisible. Hang robes hoods cupboard become underground org anization.'" With SCV, Lyons discovered didn't go underground all. Once Lyons helped install close friend, Ron Wilson, president SCV, organization's political newsletter, <a href=http://fpacscv.org/southernmercury/ >The Southern Mercury</a> (where Wilson served senior editor), transformed propaganda mill crude white supremacist cant. Mailed dues-paying members SCV — presumably including Rep. Joe Wilson — went defunct 2008, Mercury published articles describing blacks genetically inferior whites, calling African-Americans "a childlike people," warned Obama runs re-election, race riots "exceedingly violent nature" would immediately ensure, leaving "entire sections cities ruins." Here highlights Southern Mercury: "After turn 20th century, white Southerners disfranchised segregated blacks, perhaps mildest reaction possible at=2 Othat time blacks' transgressions. The blacks — childlike people — selling votes Democrats en masse $.25 apiece national elections." --"Where We Stand Now, And How We Got Here," Frank Conner, Southern Mercury, September/October 2003 "Previously, anthropologists routinely recorded notable differences IQ among races; Columbia, liberal cultural anthropologist named Franz Boas...decreed differences IQ among races, biological differences blacks whites superficial nature... Meanwhile, liberals media heaped special praise upon black athletes, musicians, singers, writers — treated typical black race.

Do need kill save it? BY MATTHEW ARMSTRONG I SEPTEMBER 11, 2009 Discussion fate Foggy Bottom usually focuses tenure Secretary State Hillary Clinton, troubles public diplomacy, rise special envoys everything European pipelines Afghanistan Pakistan. But Americans would benefit reassessment core functionality U.S. State Department. Years neglect marginalization, well dearth long-term vision strategic planning, left 19th- century institution hamstrung fiefdoms bureaucratic bottlenecks. The Pentagon funds controls wide range foreign-policy diplomatic priorities -- development public diplomacy beyond. The world changed, everyone politicians talking heads terrorists directly influencing global audiences. The pressing issues stateless: pandemics, recession, terrorism, poverty, proliferation, conflict. But report report, investigation investigation, highlighted, State Department broken paralyzed, unable respond new 21st-century paradigm. But get bad? Is possible fix? Or push wall like great Humpty Dumpty reassign pieces? There growing evidence internal machinations State Department corrupted "core missions" traditional diplomacy public diplomacy. This year, example, Government Accountability Office (gao) found department completely failed four-year-old attempt reorganize nonproliferation bureau (a bureau remains leaderless). Besides failing address mission overlap, low morale, lack career opportunities, failed reorganization caused significant drop expertise offices focused proliferation issues -- including "today's threats posted Iran, North Korea, Syria," gao's report said -- coordination bodies like International Atomic Energy Agency. Another report State Department's inspector general year described severe broad dysfunction within Africa bureau, ignoring -- perhaps considering given -- lack departmentwide integration leadership operations. Examples dysfunction range providing public diplomacy personnel computers capable reading interoffice memos failure effectively work new Africa Command. By necessity, Defense Department stepped State Department tuned out: Foggy Bottom relies Pentagon funding even personnel basic operations central mission. For example, Defense Department performs much strategic communications work traditionally purview State Department. In Somalia, example, State Department's budget public diplomacy $30,000. The Pentagon's $600,000. And, State Department's bureaucratic wisdom, $30,000 even belong undersecretary public diplomacy public affairs. Further, rivalries different "cones" -- career tracks, referred one insider "conal caste system" -- State Department severely impact morale, career growth, even operations. The report Africa bureau noted 2002, public affairs public diplomacy "failed office" -- situation worse 2009. Public outreach workers said bureau's leadership "does understand public diplomacy." The sentiment widespread. A 2008 report congressional ombudsman, U.S. Advisory Commission Public Diplomacy, described systemic failure support train public diplomacy officers field, well professional discrimination career track. Attempts fix State Department focused short-term issues, ameliorating shortages human financial resources. The last eight secretaries state attempted bolster department bolstering bottom line. No less Defense Secretary Robert Gates chairman Joint Chiefs Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, long suggested transferring funds Defense Department State Department. But situation dire State Department, point, could even absorb spend much-needed infusion cash. If wholesale transfer funds tomorrow, lack capacity skills State department would mean would give back Defenk Department dole contractors. The creeping militarization U.S. foreign policy deeply worrying, Gates Mullen, also luminaries Secretary Clinton Vice President Joe Biden. In 2008, then-Senator Biden questioned "expanding role military U.S. foreign policy." He said concerned "migration functions authorities U.S. civilian agencies Department Defense." Some commentators even wondered aloud whether best way fix State Department might destroy it. Foggy Bottom could retain small core staff embassies ambassadors. All functions -- public diplomacy, countering misinformation propaganda, development, including provincial reconstruction staffing -- could migrate Pentagon become wholly independent agencies. But atomizing State Department would ultimately prove dangerous militarization foreign policy. The Pentagon needs counterbalance, vertically integrated State Department president, Congress, U.S. public count on. Change, rather creative destruction, Foggy Bottom needs. Envision State Department capable leading whole-of-government initiatives strategic focus instead one hidebound department geared structure tradition execute state-to-state diplomacy.

To transform Foggy Bottom way require breaking rigid hierarchy, stovepipes, bottlenecks make Pentagon look lean dynamic comparison. Modern global affairs compartmentalized political borders. Besides expanding overly shallow narrow authorities public diplomacy bureau, Clinton must restructure State Department focus less countries regions. Currently, Foggy Bottom's regional bureaus, Near East Affairs, configured oversee patch embassies. Country desk officers, ambassadors, report assistant secretary, regional head. The assistant secretary turn reports undersecretary, reports Clinton. Clinton name regional bureau heads, currently assistant secretaries, undersecretary status. This would help eliminate unnecessary bureaucratic layer would also align State Department Defense Department (which powerful regional commands, Centcom Africom). The State Department's regional leaders would hold equivalent civilian rank four-star combatant commanders like Gen. David Petraeus. These changes would promise improve communications, synchronize missions, put department right path today's requirements. But Clinton beware reforming State Department quickly within -- efforts could paralyzed bureaucracy mutiny would simply wait out. U.S. national security would suffer Pentagon's growing power would become entrenched. Clinton need clear unequivocal support president importantly Congress, authorizes State Department spending bills, chance success.

Cheryl Mills < Sunday, December 6, 2009 9:39 PM Fwd: Charles Blow NYT today EF1 December 5, 2009 Op-Ed Columnist Black Age Obama By CHARLES M. BLOW A hundred fifty years ago, Charles Dickens opened "A Tale Two Cities" now-famous phrase: "It best times, worst times. ..." Those words resonated recently contemplating impact Obama presidency blacks America. So far, it's mixed. Blacks living tale two Americas — one ascension first black president cultural capital accrues; collapsing quality life amplified racial tensions, supporting president loath even acknowledge pain, let alone commiserate it. Last year, blacks dared dream anew, envisioning future Obama's election would catalyst era prosperity racial harmony. Now election's afterglow nearly faded, hysteria hope ground hard stone reality. Things gotten better. In many ways, they've gotten worse. The recession, one, dealt particularly punishing uneven hand blacks. A May report Pew Research Center found blacks likely get higher-priced subprime loans, leading higher foreclosure rates. In fact, blacks displaced Hispanics group lowest homeownership rates. According recent jobs data, unemployment rate blacks nearly twice whites, gap important demographics widened rapidly since Obama took office. The unemployment rate time white college graduates 24 years old grew 20 percent. For black cohorts, rate grew twice much. And report published last month Department Agriculture found 2008, "food insecurity" American households risen record levels, black children likely experience food insecurity. Things racial front bad. We inundated examples overt racism scale unaccustomed. Any protester racist poster hijack news cycle, racist image live forever Internet. In fact, racially offensive images first couple prolific online Google runs apologetic ad results image searches them. And it's words images; it's actions well. According Federal Bureau Investigation's 2008 hate crimes data released last week, anti-black hate crimes rose 4 percent 2007, combined hate crimes racial categories declined 11 percent. If look two-year trend, would include Obarna's ascension candidate, anti-black hate crimes risen 8 percent, racial groups fallen 19 percent. This sobering effect blacks. According Nov. 9 report Gallup, last summer 23 percent blacks thought race relations would get lot better election Obama. Now less half percentage says things actually gotten lot better. The racial animosity Obama's election stirred may contributed rallying effect among blacks. According Gallup report published Nov. 24, Obama's approval rating among whites dropped 39 percent, among blacks remains 90 percent. Also, hasn't exactly good year black men news. Plaxico Burress locked accidentally shooting gun club. Henry Louis Gates Jr. locked intentionally shooting mouth home. And Michael Jackson died shot full propofol. Chris Brown brutally beat Rihanna. Former Representative William Jefferson convicted. And recently, "personal failings" Tiger Woods portray alley cat. Meanwhile, critically acclaimed black movie year, "Precious," features black man rapes twice impregnates daughter. Rooting president feels like nice counterbalance. However, rallying creates conundrum blacks: air anxiety without arming Obama's enemies. This dilemma rendered blacks virtually voiceless pressing issues time voices would presumably held greater sway. This means Obama get away almost nothing specifically address issues important African-Americans instead focus white voters he's losing droves. This gone unnoticed. In Nov. 9 Gallup poll, number blacks felt Obama would go far enough promoting efforts aid black community jumped 60 percent last summer now. The hard truth Obama needs white voters needs black ones. According analysis, even every black person America stayed home Election Day, Obama would still president. To large degree, Obama elected white people, able accept consciously portrayed racially ambiguous. In fact, commiserating blacks could prove politically problematic. In study published journal Proceedings National Academy Sciences month, researchers asked subjects rate images president determine ones best represented "true essence." In photos, skin lightened. In others, darkened. The result? The people identified "whiter" images, likely voted him, vice versa. The Age Obama, far least, seems less Obama black community game-changer White House gamesman. It's unclear positive Obama Effect, Obama Backlash increasingly apparent. Meanwhile, black people also living tale two actions: grin bear it. Forwarded message

Krugman, case haven't seen: January 1, 2010 Op-Ed Columnist Chinese New Year By PAUL KRUGMAN It's season pundits traditionally make predictions year ahead. Mine concerns international economics: I predict 2010 year China. And good way. Actually, biggest problems China involve climate change. But today I want focus currency policy. China become major financial trade power. But doesn't act like big economies. Instead, follows mercantilist policy, keeping trade surplus artificially high. And today's depressed world, policy is, put bluntly, predatory. Here's works: Unlike dollar, euro yen, whose values fluctuate freely, China's currency pegged official policy 6.8 yuan dollar. At exchange rate, Chinese manufacturing large cost advantage rivals, leading huge trade surpluses. Under normal circumstances, inflow dollars surpluses would push value China's currency, unless offset private investors heading way. And private investors trying get China, it. But China's government restricts capital inflows, even buys dollars parks abroad, adding $2 trillion-plus hoard foreign exchange reserves. This policy good China's export-oriented state-industrial complex, good Chinese consumers. But rest us? In past, China's accumulation foreign reserves, many invested American bonds, arguably us favor keeping interest rates low — although low interest rates mainly inflate housing bubble. But right world awash cheap money, looking someplace go. Short-term interest rates close zero; long-term interest rates higher, investors expect zero-rate policy end day. China's bond purchases make little difference. Meanwhile, trade surplus drains much-needed demand away depressed world economy. My back-of-the- envelope calculations suggest next couple years Chinese mercantilism may end reducing U.S. employment around 1.4 million jobs. The Chinese refuse acknowledge problem. Recently Wen Jiabao, prime minister, dismissed foreign complaints: "On one hand, asking yuan appreciate, hand, taking kinds protectionist measures." Indeed: countries taking (modest) protectionist measures precisely China refuses let currency rise. And measures entirely appropriate. Or they? I usually hear two reasons confronting China policies. Neither holds water. First, there's claim can't confront Chinese would wreak havoc U.S. economy dumping hoard dollars. This wrong, Chinese would inflict large losses themselves. The larger point forces make Chinese mercantilism damaging right also mean China little financial leverage. Again, right world awash cheap money. So China start selling dollars, there's reason think would significantly raise U.S. interest rates. It would probably weaken dollar currencies — would good, bad, U.S. competitiveness employment. So Chinese dump dollars, send thank-you note.

Dec 30th 2009 From The Economist print edition The rich world's quiet revolution: women gradually taking workplace Getty Images AT A time world short causes celebration, candidate: within next months women cross 50% threshold become majority American workforce. Women already make majority university graduates OECD countries majority professional workers several rich countries, including United States. Women run many world's great companies, PepsiCo America Areva France. Women's economic empowerment arguably biggest social change times. Just generation ago, women largely confined repetitive, menial jobs. They routinely subjected casual sexism expected abandon careers married children. Today running organisations treated second-class citizens. Millions women given control lives. And millions brains put productive use. Societies try resist trend—most notably Arab countries, also Japan southern European countries—will pay heavy price form wasted talent frustrated citizens. This revolution achieved modicum friction (see article). Men have, large, welcomed women's invasion workplace. Yet even positive changes incomplete unsatisfactory. This particular advance comes two stings. The first women still under- represented top companies. Only 2% bosses America's largest companies 5% peers Britain women. They also paid significantly less men average. The second juggling work child-rearing difficult. Middle-class couples routinely complain little time children. But biggest losers poor children— particularly places like America Britain combined high levels female participation labour force reluctance spend public money child care. Dealing juggle These two problems closely related. Many women feel choose children careers. Women prosper high-pressure companies 20s drop dramatic numbers 30s find almost impossible regain earlier momentum. Less-skilled women trapped poorly paid jobs hand-to-mouth child-care arrangements. Motherhood, sexism, issue: America, childless women earn almost much men, mothers earn significantly less. And mothers' relative poverty also disadvantages children. Demand female brains helping alleviate problems. Even new theories warm-hearted women making inherently superior workers bunk (see article), several trends favour educated sex, including "war talent" growing flexibility workplace. Law firms, consultancies banks rethinking "up out" promotion systems losing many able women. More 90% companies Germany Sweden allow flexible working. And new technology making easier redesign work sorts family-friendly ways. Women certainly performed better past decade men. In European Union women filled 6m 8m new jobs created since 2000. In America three four people thrown work since "mancession" began male. And shift towards women likely continue: 2011 2.6m female male university students America. The light hand state All argues, mostly, letting market work. That stopped calls hefty state intervention Scandinavian sort. Norway used threats quotas dramatic effect. Some 40% legislators women. All Scandinavian countries provide plenty state-financed nurseries. They highest levels female employment world far fewer social problems plague Britain America. Surely, comes argument, way speed revolution—and improve tough lives many working women children? If means massive intervention, shape affirmative-action programmes across-the-board benefits parents sorts, answer no. To begin with, promoting people basis sex illiberal unfair, stigmatises beneficiaries. And practical problems. Lengthy periods paid maternity leave put firms hiring women, helps explain Swedish women work public sector Sweden lower proportion women management America does. But plenty cheaper, subtler ways governments make life easier women. Welfare states designed women stayed home. They need change way operate. German schools, instance, close midday. American schools shut two months summer. These things changed without huge cost. Some popular American charter schools offer longer school days shorter summer holidays. And, without going Scandinavian lengths, America could invest children: spends lower share GDP public child-care almost rich country, rich country refuses provide mothers paid maternity leave. Barack Obama needs measure campaign rhetoric "real family values". Still, nagging problems overshadow dramatic progress women made recent decades. During second world war, America's menfolk front, government summon image Rosie Riveter, flexed muscle "We Can Do It" slogan, encourage women workforce. Today women marching workplace ever larger numbers taking sledgehammer remaining glass ceilings.

Politico Poll: Clinton approval soars By: Eamon Javers December 16, 2009 03:00 PM EST A new poll avid news watchers shows Secretary State Hillary Clinton much higher approval rating man campaigned works for, President Barack Obama. In poll 800 registered voters self-identified "news watchers," Clinton 75 percent approval rating 21 percent disapproval rating overall. Obama, contrast, 51 percent approval 45 percent disapproval rating. The Secretary State conducted several well-received foreign trips recent months closely identified contentious elements Administration's agenda, including health care fight, federal deficit Wall Street bailouts. And subjected nearly media partisan scrutiny president. Obama, meanwhile, national television daily basis tackling wide range difficult issues. The poll conducted nonpartisan Clarus Research Group December 7th 12th, asked opinions top Cabinet secretaries White House officials. Its finding Obama Clinton mirrors earlier polls — October, example, Gallup poll found Clinton become popular president. Clarus president Ron Faucheux said one reason Clinton's high poll numbers high approval among Republicans — numbers said position well run president future, chooses. Clinton 96 percent approval among Democrats, healthy 57 percent approval among Republicans, 65 percent approval among Independents. Obama nearly popular among Democrats — 93 percent — numbers among Republicans Independents fell dramatically, 19 percent 33 percent respectively. Clinton's Republican numbers striking, given intensely disliked past among GOP voters. In fact, part Obama's appeal Democratic primary voters 2008 likely able bridge partisan divide Clinton, well-known figure dating time first lady 1990s. "Republicans may see hawkish Democrats foreign policy issues," said Faucheux. "It may way bolster position within administration." Asked future Clinton presidential bid, said, "She's good shape now." The next highest-rated cabinet secretary survey Defense Secretary Robert Gates, notched 69 percent overall approval rate 78 percent approval among Democrats 63 percent among Republicans independents. "Both Clinton Gates well across partisan board," said Faucheux. "Everybody else well among Democrats fell among Republicans." Another trend spotted pollsters: Approval ratings inside Beltway higher rest country. "These results show 'Beltway echo chamber' reflect rest country, even among news watchers," said Faucheux. Among White House staffers advisors, Press Secretary Robert Gibbs — often seen television — highest overall rating 50 percent. Economic advisor Larry Summers lowest approval, 25 percent. Summers Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner — closely associated economy — posted higher disapproval numbers approval. Summers' disapproval rating 41 percent. Geithner's disapproval rating 45 percent, one point higher approval rating. The poll also found White House Chief Staff Rahm Emanuel, often viewed sharp partisan elbows, scored much higher among Democrats, 72 percent, Republicans, 13 percent. Among major administration officials, Vice President Joe Biden 50 percent approval 41 percent disapproval rating; Attorney General Eric Holder HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius posted 41 percent approval 35 percent disapproval; Presidential Adviser David Axelrod scored 38 percent approval 36 percent disapproval; National Security Adviser James Jones 30 percent approval 23 percent disapproval rating.

In poll 800 registered voters self-identified "news watchers," Clinton 75 percent approval rating 21 percent disapproval rating overall. Obama, contrast, 51 percent approval 45 percent disapproval rating. The Secretary State conducted several well-received foreign trips recent months closely identified contentious elements Administration's agenda, including health care fight, federal deficit Wall Street bailouts. And subjected nearly media partisan scrutiny president. Obama, meanwhile, national television _ daily basis tackling wide range difficult issues. The poll conducted nonpartisan Clarus Research Group December 7th 12th, asked opinions top Cabinet secretaries White House officials. Its finding Obama Clinton mirrors earlier polls — October, example, Gallup poll found Clinton become popular president. Clarus president Ron Faucheux said one reason Clinton's high poll numbers high approval among Republicans — numbers said position well run president future, chooses. Clinton 96 percent approval among Democrats, healthy 57 percent approval among Republicans, 65 percent approval among Independents. Obama nearly popular among Democrats — 93 percent — numbers among Republicans Independents fell dramatically, 19 percent 33 percent respectively. Clinton's Republican numbers striking, given intensely disliked past among GOP voters. In fact, part Obama's appeal Democratic primary voters 2008 likely able bridge partisan divide Clinton, well-known figure dating time first lady 1990s. "Republicans may see hawkish Democrats foreign policy issues," said Faucheux. "It may way bolster position within administration." Asked future Clinton presidential bid, said, "She's good shape now." The next highest-rated cabinet secretary survey Defense Secretary Robert Gates, notched 69 percent overall approval rate 78 percent approval among Democrats 63 percent among Republicans independents. "Both Clinton Gates well across partisan board," said Faucheux. "Everybody else well among Democrats fell among Republicans." Another trend spotted pollsters: Approval ratings inside Beltway higher rest country. "These results show 'Beltway echo chamber' reflect rest country, even among news watchers," said Faucheux. Among White House staffers advisors, Press Secretary Robert Gibbs — often seen television — highest overall rating 50 percent. Economic advisor Larry Summers lowest approval, 25 percent. Summers Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner — closely associated economy — posted higher disapproval numbers approval. Summers' disapproval rating 41 percent. Geithner's disapproval rating 45 percent, one point higher approval rating. The poll also found White House Chief Staff Rahm Emanuel, often viewed sharp partisan elbows, scored much higher among Democrats, 72 percent, Republicans, 13 percent. Among major administration officials, Vice President Joe Biden 50 percent approval 41 percent disapproval rating; Attorney General Eric Holder HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius posted 41 percent approval 35 percent disapproval; Presidential Adviser David Axelrod scored 38 percent approval 36 percent disapproval; National Security Adviser James Jones 30 percent approval 23 percent disapproval rating.

H: Of interest, Hague latest briefing, hostile Tony. Tories desperately want Blair there, want run European policy, mostly anti-EU, indeed break past continuity Europe. Tory Party split, anti-EU faction dominant, base virulent, Cameron straddling best can. Hague leans anti-Europe. S London Times October 22, 2009 `Appointing Blair EU president consequences', warns Hague William Hague's strident attack fellow Briton reportedly left EU ambassadors baffled Francis Elliott, David Charter Tom Baldwin William Hague conducting behind-the-scenes campaign convince European ambassadors Tony Blair would bad choice European Union president, The Times learnt. The Shadow Foreign Secretary used lunch organised Swedish presidency London last week lobby senior diplomats 26 EU nations appointment. EU leaders hoped choose new president next week's summit, Czech Republic's last-minute objections Lisbon treaty scuppered that. President Sarkozy France wants quick decision, however, understood pushing special one-day summit Brussels next month fill new post. In making Conservatives' case Mr Blair, Mr Hague said Downing Street former Prime Minister consistently placed higher priority US interests Europe. Mr Hague also reminded diplomats Mr Blair's actions run-up Iraq war, according one attending lunch last Thursday. A claim Mr Hague told ambassadors Tories would regard Mr Blair's appointment "declaration war" EU denied, however. A spokesman Mr Hague said phrase "a bit strong". Nevertheless, disputed Mr Hague made clear move would consequences relations Britain Brussels. Diplomats said "clear mark hostility". "Mr Hague wanted leave ambassadors doubt Conservative Party opposed appointment Tony Blair president European Council [that] would underline lack accountability legitimacy involved creation position first place," Mr Hague's spokesman said.

Below Economist blogger re efforts wil EU discredit Ashton, particularly French. Wouldn't hurt mention positively French interlocutors. See particularly line: "There is, frankly, whiff old boy's network Lady Ashton: lifetime member honourable guild former foreign ministers, surrounded men suits think know lot foreign policy does. There much sympathy complicated family life, involving young children, much commuting Brussels Britain." A blog author column European Union Charlemagne's notebook . Why Lady Ashton take EU's foreign policy job? • Jan 26th 2010, 22:04 NOT yet February, briefing Catherine Ashton, newly appointed EU foreign policy chief, getting nasty. Jean Quatremer, Brussels blogger well-connected EU correspondent Liberation, dropped another depth charge baroness tonight. His list complaints long, I feeling smidgeon exaggerated. I find hard believe literally impossible reach Lady Ashton eight o'clock evening Mr Quatremer charges, allegedly mobile telephones diverted EU situation centre (a small intelligence analysis cell staffed officers national servicies) hour. I also doubts stress laid fact yet got round top secret security clearance yet, cannot see confidential papers. As former British cabinet minister, serving UK commissioner, something tells British least may share odd secret her. A senior official I saw today also made point holder Lady Ashton's post would currently struggling teething problems squabbling new foreign policy apparatus created Lisbon Treaty takes shape. There is, frankly, whiff old boy's network Lady Ashton: lifetime member honourable guild former foreign ministers, surrounded men suits think know lot foreign policy does.

sbwhoeop Tuesday, December 22, 2009 7:28 PM truth account? Sid H: Is account true? If so, significant, account kind. And, true, USG told story, least. Sid X r --r How I know China wrecked Copenhagen deal? I room As recriminations fly post-Copenhagen, one writer offers fly-on-the-wall account talks faded 0 0 Mark cvnas o c. ..q,uk, Tuesday 22 December 2009 19.54 GMT Copenhagen disaster. That much agreed. But truth actually happened danger lost amid spin inevitable mutual recriminations. The truth this: Chrs.a wrecked talks, intentionally humiliated Barack Obama, insisted awful "dear western leaders would walk away carrying blame. How I know this? Because I room saw happen. China's strategy simple: block open negotiations two weeks, ensure closed-door deal made It look west failed world's poor again. And sure enough, aid agencies, civil society movements environmental groups took bait. The failure "the inevitable result rich countries refusing adequately fairly shoulder overwhelming responsibility", said Christian Aid. "Rich countries bullied developing nations," fumed Friends Earth International. All predictable, complete opposite truth. Even George IVIonbiot, writing yesterday's Guardian, made mistake singly blaming Obama. But I saw Obama fighting desperately salvage deal, Chinese delegate saying "no", again. Monbiot even approvingly quoted Sudanese delegate Lumumba Di-Aping, denounced Copenhagen accord "a suicide pact, incineration pact, order maintain economic dominance countries". Sudan behaves talks puppet China; one number countries relieves Chinese delegation fight battles open sessions. It perfect stitch-up. China gutted deal behind scenes, left proxies savage public. Here's actually went late last Friday night, heads state two dozen countries met behind closed doors. Obama table several hours, sitting Gordon Brown Ethiopian prime minister, Males Zenawi. The Danish prime minister chaired, right sat Ban Ki-moon, secretary-general UN. Probably 50 60 people, including heads state, room. I attached one delegations, whose head state also present time. What I saw profoundly shocking. The Chinese premier, Wen Jinbao, deign attend meetings personally, instead sending second-tier official country's foreign ministry sit opposite Obama himself. The diplomatic snub obvious brutal, practical implication: several times session, world's powerful heads state forced wait around Chinese delegate went make telephone calls "superiors". Shifting blame To would blame Obama rich countries general, know this: China's representative insisted industrialised country targets, previously agreed 80% cut 2050, taken deal. "Why can't even mention targets?" demanded furious Angela Merkel. Australia's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, annoyed enough bang microphone. Brazil's representative pointed illogicality China's position. Why rich countries announce even unilateral cut? The Chinese delegate said no, I watched, aghast, Merkel threw hands despair conceded point. Now know — China bet, correctly, Obama would get blame Copenhagen accord's lack ambition. China, backed times India, proceeded take numbers mattered. A 2020 peaking year global emissions, essential restrain temperatures 2C, removed replaced woolly language suggesting emissions peak "as soon possible". The long-term target, global 50% cuts 2050, also excised. No one else, perhaps exceptions India Saudi Arabia, wanted happen. I certain Chinese room, would left Copenhagen deal environmentalists popping champagne corks popping every corner world. Strong position So China manage pull coup? First, extremely strong negotiating position. China didn't need deal. As one developing country foreign minister said me: "The Athenians nothing offer Spartans." On hand, western leaders particular — also presidents Lula Brazil, Zuma South Africa, Calderon Mexico many others — desperate positive outcome. Obama needed strong deal perhaps anyone. The US confirmed offer $100bn developing countries adaptation, put serious cuts table first time (17% 2005 levels 2020), obviously prepared offer. Above all, Obama needed able demonstrate Senate could deliver China global climate regulation framework, conservative senators could argue US carbon cuts would advantage Chinese industry. With midterm elections looming, Obama staff also knew Copenhagen would probably opportunity go cjinT3t?j..chanQE-3. talks strong mandate. This strengthened China's negotiating hand, complete lack civil society political pressure either China India. Campaign groups never blame developing countries failure; iron rule never broken. The Indians, particular. become past masters ca- opting language equity ("equal rights atmosphere") service planetary suicide — leftish campaigners commentators hoist petard. With deal gutted, heads state session concluded final battle Chinese delegate insisted removing 1.5C target beloved small island states low-lying nations lose rising seas. President Nasheed Maldives, supported Brown, fought valiantly save crucial number. "How ask country go extinct?" demanded Nasheed. The Chinese delegate feigned great offence — number stayed, surrounded language makes meaningless. The deed done. China's game All raises question: China's game? Why China, words UK-based analyst also spent hours heads state meetings, "not reject targets itself, also refuse allow country take binding targets?" The analyst, attended climate conferences 15 years, concludes China wants weaken climate regulation regime "in order avoid risk might called ambitious years' time". This mean China serious global warming. It strong wind solar industries. But China's growth, growing global political economic dominance, based largely cheap coal. China knows becoming uncontested superpower; indeed newfound muscular confidence striking display Copenhagen. Its coal-based economy doubles every decade, power increases commensurately. Its leadership alter magic formula unless absolutely to. Copenhagen much worse another bad deal, illustrated profound shift global geopolitics. This fast becoming China's century, yet leadership displayed multilateral environmental governance priority, viewed hindrance new superpower's freedom action. I left Copenhagen despondent I felt long time. After hope hype, mobilisation thousands, wave optimism crashed rock global power politics, fell back, drained away. [Go]

To rebuild Haiti, start young people A 700,000-strong national civic service corps would harness untapped labor rapidly instill national pride confidence. By Robert Muggah Robert Maguire January 31, 2010 Haiti need big ideas recover rebuild aftermath devastating magnitude 7.0 earthquake month. The reported death toll topped 150,000, reconstruction needs incalculable. How starting 700,000-strong national civic service corps made Haitian youth? There many reasons entity makes lot sense. Haiti young country. An estimated 70% population 30; 15-to-29 segment alone makes 50% population. Demographers long cautioned excessively youthful populations potentially exacerbate underdevelopment accentuate political instability. Although Haiti registers among lowest levels education Western Hemisphere, Haitian youth wellspring creativity, talent potential. You don't need community-development specialist know stifled lack meaningful opportunities. Fortunately, Haiti enabling environment set civic service corps. Article 52 Haitian Constitution commits citizens national service, though never activated. What more, many Haitian international organizations mobilized ready help government get going. A civic service corps would get young able tent cities around Port-au-Prince work. They could start once-iconic center capital, also could begin planting trees, working fields providing services Haiti's countryside. At minimum, would reverse generations unfair stigmatizing youth there. This plan would also harness untapped labor rapidly. Before Jan. 12 earthquake, 50% youth 20s work. Putting service toward rebuilding capital outlying areas would first step restoring country's pride dignity. A civic service corps would also multiply international efforts promote recovery world moves next crisis. Hundreds humanitarian agencies, donor governments nongovernmental organizations facing monumental challenges coordinating relief assistance. Although everyone involved committed rapid disbursement, transaction costs monumental. A civic service corps would allow rapid form transferring capital. Direct support corps would inject serious liquidity Haitian economy stimulate recovery bottom up. Rather food-for-work schemes, international best practice recommends proposals promote direct monetary transfers beneficiaries. Haitian youth families urgent needs don't need paternalistic programs curb choices. With proper oversight financial safeguards, civic service corps would circumvent unnecessary administrative costs. Further, civic service corps would restore national pride confidence Haitian public institutions. During past decades, state provided relatively services Haitians, particularly outside capital. In cases, state entities downright predatory. As result, nonstate providers, including gangs shady middlemen, filled gap. A civic service corps -- wearing Haitian colors acting first responders organizations demonstrating government's presence ground -- would show government serious supporting citizens. It would symbolic first step toward renewing social contract people. A civic service corps also makes sense long-term risk emergency planning. Haiti situated path hurricanes fault line, expect disasters. Training 700,000 young people -- especially young women -- basics first aid, emergency response, community policing skills would greatly mitigate consequences future calamities. With disciplined training management, corps could provide intensive training specialized areas -- engineering, telecommunications public health. An initial step getting Haiti's youth work could include preparation road map future meetings Haiti, including U.N. donor conference scheduled March.

Before earthquake, Viva Rio Brazilian peacekeepers recruited trained hundreds Haitian youth, including former gang members, provide relief services Haiti's slums. This program could reactivated scaled quickly. A civic service corps could draw lessons groups target recruit youths for, say, two years. The Haitian government would, course, need one manage undertaking, direct oversight president's office Interior Ministry. And many countries could provide advice support. Nongovernmental groups private donors could also play key role mobilizing support transferring essential skills. Haiti's youth future nation, central Haiti's recovery.

The policy review scheduled July 2010 may well precipitate it. pl 26 December 2009 Afahanistan, gpvernment, Policy, Pali .s perm.aiin4c Civilian, military planners different views new approach Afghanistan By Rajiv Chandrasekaran Washington Post Staff Writer Saturday, December 26, 2009; A01 Two days announcing deployment additional U.S. troops 8fg,rianistan, President Obama informed Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal granting McChrystal's request double size Afghan army police. Cost factor, questions whether capacity exists train 400,000 personnel. The president told McChrystal, top commander U.S. NATO forces Afghanistan, focus fielding little half number next October. Ten days Obama's speech, U.S. command responsible training Afghans circulated chart detailing combined personnel targets army police. McChrystal's goal 400,000 remained unchanged. "It's open issue," senior Pentagon official said last week. Nearly month Obama unveiled revised Afghanistan strategy, military civilian leaders come away differing views several fundamental aspects president's new approach, according dozen senior administration military officials involved Afghanistan policy, spoke condition anonymity discuss internal deliberations. Members Obama's war cabinet disagree meaning pledge begin drawing forces July 2011 whether mission narrowed proposal advanced McChrystal August assessment war. The disagreements opened fault line desire early exit among several senior officials White House conviction among military commanders victory still achievable terms. The differences complicating implementation new strategy. Some officers responded July 2011 date seeking accelerate pace operations, instead narrowing them. At White House, senior administration official said, National Security Council discussing ways increase monitoring military State Department activities Afghanistan prevent "overreaching." The NSC's strategic guidance, classified document outlines president's new approach, described senior administration official limiting military operations "in scale scope minimum required achieve two goals -- prevent ai-Qaeda safe havens prevent Taliban toppling government." The use resource- intensive counterinsurgency tactics -- employing U.S. forces protect Afghan civilians Taliban -- supposed restricted key cities towns southern eastern parts country, official said. "The strategy fundamentally changed. This COIN strategy," Vice President Biden said MSNBC last week, using military's shorthand counterinsurgency. "This 'go occupy whole country.' " Setting limits During videoconference two days speech, Obama made clear McChristal U.S. Ambassador Karl W. Eikenberry want additional troops fuel broader mission. Speaking men White House Situation Room, president told deploy forces areas would able transfer Afghan security forces July 2011, according two senior officials knowledge conversation. Obama's essential instruction was, according one officials, "Don't bite chew." White House officials said president opposes using forces authorized duplicate expansive, iraq-style counterinsurgency operation -- part questions whether possible achieve similar outcome Afghanistan, less developed, wants start reducing troops 18 months. The White House's desired end state Afghanistan, officials said, envisions informal local security arrangements Iraq, less- capable national government greater tolerance insurgent violence. Senior military officials still think achieve better outcome envisaged civilian skeptics administration using new forces mount comprehensive counterinsurgency operations. Although Pentagon strategists McChrystal's advisers Kabul looking fulfill White House desire less extensive mission, military officials said reluctant strip much away weaken approach come revered within ranks way suppress guerrilla movements. Military officials contend McChrystal harbor expansionist aims. They note begun removing troops remote mountain valleys concentrating resources modest number key population centers. But approach areas involve counterinsurgency tactics: Troops focus restoring normal patterns life trying keep Taliban bay, helping Afghan government provide basic services population training local security forces. McChrystal's plan, senior Pentagon official said, "is still counterinsurgency, regardless various agendas people trying spin." Dissent drawdown During strategy discussions White House, differences White House military came sharp relief °baffle's decision announce intention begin drawing troops July 2011. McChrystal argued it, according three officials familiar process. The head U.S. Central Command, Gen. David H. Petraeus, also expressed concerns. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates urged Obama make drawdoWn "conditions-based." "There lot push back" Defense Department, one officials said. The president received cover one uniformed general table, James E. Cartwright, vice chairman Joint Chiefs Staff. Cartwright adopted skeptical view mission many military colleagues, one resonated Obama Biden. Cartwright effectively endorsed July 2011 date, arguing increasing forces engaging limited counterinsurgency made sense, senior administration official said, "but given risk factors -- Pakistan, Karzai government, whole notion sub-national governance track record [Afghan security forces], prestigious -- made sense demonstrate could actually this." It. also helped Obama principal troop-increase proposal discussed time -- recommendation McChrystal receive 30,000 forces 18 24 months -- developed Gates. The Defense Department paperwork detailing proposal identified increase starting summer 2009, first troops deployed president year began conducting operations Afghanistan, specify end date. "Rather leaving indefinite hypothetical, president's intervention say, 'Okay, we're starting July '09, we're really talking July '11," said senior administration official described NSC guidance. Obama eventually told war cabinet would announce July 2011 deadline pace withdrawals would determined, Gates sought, conditions ground. Obama said would conduct thorough review progress year's time. Although endorse McChrystal's request increase Afghan security forces 400,000, said would reevaluate issue 2010 goal training 230,000 forces achieved. The president avoided details Dec. 1 address, leaving members Cabinet advisers explain specifics. The result wide divergence expectations. Gates, appearing NBC's "Meet Press" Sunday speech, said perhaps "some handful small number" would withdrawn. Biden, MSNBC appearance last week, said chart showing increase U.S. deployments year would "coming rapidly next two years." The ambiguity meaning July 2011 deadline generated uncertainty presidents intent. "Is surge way helping us leave quickly, timeline way help win support surge?" asked senior Democratic staff member Congress. "Which strategy head-fake? Nobody knows." One senior military officer Afghanistan said fellow soldiers "don't know 18 months, whether progress report leads minor changes." "Until tell us otherwise," officer said, "we're operating latter policy." A 'dramatic change'? Although senior-level civilians administration emerged review process thinking mission circumscribed, senior military officials continue different view. The result, see it, White House embraced McChrystal's original plan. "We already pretty focused wouldn't try clear hold things needed to," said senior commander involved war. "It wasn't dramatic change means." White House officials cited meeting among NSC staff members McChrystal general displayed slide stating mission "Defeat Taliban," civilians deemed overly ambitious suggested every last member Taliban would killed captured. The officials said mission redefined avoid term. But military officers, defeat "doesn't mean wipe everyone out," commander said. "It means Waterloo, Napoleon still army wasn't going threaten Europe. We used view worked defeat." Even White House review finished, commander charge day-to-day operations, Lt. Gen. David M. Rodriguez, developed plan concentrate U.S. NATO efforts 80 country's nearly 400 districts. "They're taking credit things McChrystal already calling narrowed focus," senior military official said. White House advisers maintain review process refine mission beyond McChrystal proposed summer. "There real narrowing here," senior administration official said. "Stan big leadership task adapt original concept new strategic guidance." The official said NSC officials recognize take time new orders filter ranks. "This doesn't turn around speech," official said. "But I hope don't see slides month continue state goal 400,000" Afghan security forces. The challenge, said official another senior administration official, recalibrate military operations next 18 months accordance new goal. "The guidance we're everything, we're forever," second official said. "The hardest intellectual exercise settling much enough." For now, however, top military officers speak expansively White House advisers. "Winning means hand security force secure country," senior Pentagon official said. "We've separated enemy, we've connected people government, we're helping rebuild economy. It's point begin transition them." Terms "winning" "victory" eschewed White House. Obama use either Dec. 1 address, said interview earlier year uncomfortable using term "victory" fighting "a non-state actor, shadowy operation like al-Qaeda." But Gates visited Kabul week Obama's speech, made point telling military personnel "we thing win." "From moral perspective, ask soldiers families sacrifice, win," Pentagon official said. "We need able articulate winning."

The New Public Diplomacy Joseph S. Nye 2010-02-10 CAMBRIDGE — The world traditional power politics typically whose military economy would win. In today's information age, politics also whose "story" wins. National narratives are, indeed, type currency. Governments compete organizations enhance credibility weaken opponents. Witness contest government protesters Iranian elections June 2009, Internet Twitter played crucial roles, recent controversy Google China. Reputation always mattered world politics, credibility become crucial "paradox plenty." When information plentiful, scarce resource attention. Under new conditions, soft sell may, ever, prove effective hard sell. For example, relative independence BBC, sometimes source consternation British governments, paid rich dividends credibility, illustrated account Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete's day: "he rises dawn, listens BBC World Service, scans Tanzanian press." Skeptics treat term "public diplomacy" mere euphemism propaganda miss point. Simple propaganda counterproductive public diplomacy. Nor public diplomacy merely public-relations campaign. Public diplomacy also involves building long-term relationships create enabling environment government policies. The contribution direct government information long-term cultural relationships varies three dimensions stages public diplomacy, three important. The first immediate dimension daily communications, involves explaining context domestic foreign-policy decisions. This dimension also involves preparation dealing crises. If vacuum information event, others rush fill it. The second dimension strategic communication, develops set simple themes, much political advertising campaign does. While first dimension measured hours days, second occurs weeks, months, even years. The third dimension public diplomacy development lasting relationships key individuals many years even decades, scholarships, exchanges, training, seminars, conferences, access media channels. These programs develop American journalist Edward R. Murrow called crucial "last three feet" — face-to-face communications, enhanced credibility reciprocity creates. But even best advertising cannot sell unpopular product. A communications strategy cannot work cuts grain policy. Actions speak louder words. All often, policymakers treat public diplomacy bandage applied damage done instruments. For example, China tried enhance soft power successfully staging 2008 Olympics, domestic simultaneous crackdown Tibet — subsequent repression Xinxiang arrests human rights lawyers — undercut gains. Great powers try use culture narrative create soft power promotes advantage, always understand it. Critics United States complain over-militarization foreign policy undercuts credibility. Instead, advocate diplomacy "on steroids," staffed diplomats trained new media, cross-cultural communications, granular local knowledge, networks contacts under- represented groups. The centralized mass-media approach public diplomacy still plays important role. Governments need correct daily misrepresentations policies, well try convey longer-term strategic message. The main strength mass-media approach audience reach ability generate public awareness set agenda. But weakness inability influence message perceived different cultural settings. The sender knows says, always targets hear. Cultural barriers apt distort heard. Networked communications, hand, take advantage two-way communications peer-to- peer relations overcome cultural differences. This type decentralization flexibility difficult governments accomplish, given central accountability structures. The greater flexibility non-governmental organizations using networks given rise call "the new public diplomacy," longer confined messaging, promotion campaigns, even direct governmental contacts foreign publics serving foreign-policy purposes. It also building relationships civil-society actors countries facilitating networks non-governmental parties home abroad. In approach public diplomacy, government policy aimed promoting participating in, rather controlling, cross-border networks. Indeed, much government control, even appearance it, undercut credibility networks designed engender. The evolution public diplomacy one-way communications two-way dialogue treats publics co-creators meaning communication. Power global information age, ever, include soft dimension attraction well hard dimensions coercion payment. Combining dimensions effectively called "smart power." For - example, current struggle transnational terrorism struggle winning hearts minds, over-reliance hard power alone path success. Public diplomacy important tool arsenal smart power, smart public diplomacy requires understanding credibility, self-criticism, role civil society generating soft power. If degenerates propaganda, public diplomacy fails convince, undercut soft power. Instead, must remain two-way process, soft power depends, first foremost, upon understanding minds others.

Over following months, pharmaceutical industry lobbyists executives met top White House aides dozens times hammer deal would secure industry support administration's health care reform agenda exchange White House abandoning key elements president's promises reform pharmaceutical industry.

In 2008 campaign, Obama declared intention include stakeholders sought reform nation's health care system, also supported key qemocr.atic health reform uok, sies. Among several targeted pharmaceutical industry: Allowing re-importation drugs first world countries lower drug prices providing Medicare negotiating authority prescription drug prices recently enacted Part D program. These weren't promises, Obama already voted senator 2007. (Rdl Call Vote 132 Roll call Vo.t.c.-) 150.) Set carry agenda two Capitol Hill veterans, schooled monied Washington culture, chief staff Rahm Emanuel deputy chief staff Jim Messina. Emanuel former fundraiser, Clinton administration official, investment banker member Democratic leadership Congress. Messina former campaign manager B6 chief staff powerful Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus. Both known unparalleled legislative abilities. Because Obama's decision develop plan operating legislative process, members Congress also played key roles. Early on, pharmaceutical companies told deal directly Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Bpuf. -4:s. Baucus would vehicle deal worked behind scenes White House PhRMA. Central effort PhRMA president, CEO top lobbyist Billy Tauzin, longtime Democratic member Congress switched party affiliations Republicans gained control Congress 1994. By switching parties Tauzin able maintain influence even rose Chairman House Committee Energy & Commerce. Tauzin became poster child Washington's mercenary culture. He crafted bill provide prescription drug access Medicare recipients, one provided major concessions pharmaceutical industry. Medicare would able negotiate lower prescription drug costs reimportation drugs first world countries would allowed. A months bill passed, Tauzin announced retiring Congress would taking job helming PhRMA salary $2 million. Tauzin's job change became fodder campaign ad presidential candidate Barack Obama ran spring 2008 simply titled ".Biliy." It featured candidate, sleeves rolled up, talking salon gasping Americans ways Washington. "The pharmaceutical industry wrote prescription drug plan Medicare could negotiate drug companies. And know what, chairman committee, pushed law through, went work pharmaceutical industry making $2 million year." The screen fades black inform viewer that, "Barack Obama candidate refuses Washington lobbyist money," candidate continues lecture, "Imagine that. That's example old game playing Washington. You know, I don't want learn play game better, I want put end game playing." Aiding PhRMA outreach Congress would squadron lobbyists push health care reform priorities. Over course 2009, drug industry trade group sdeft:tow::!i: _ 520 tniliion house hired lobbyists. Aside PhRMA's massive in-house lobbying operation, trade group hired 48 outside lobbying firms. The total number lobbyists working PhRMA 2009 reached 165. Some 137 165 lobbyists representing PhRMA former employees either legislative executive branches.

In interview touted "optimistic plan", acknowledging industry problems glad chance discuss these. Spme duri?0,7rognnd,, ,td apparent change heart behalf industry long adverse health care reforms. On April 15, Jim Messina Jon Selib, chief staff Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus, convened meeting headquarters Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) leaders organized labor health care groups, including PhRMA. At meeting, groups decided form two nonprofit entities promote reform efforts, Healthy Economy Now Americans Stable Quality Care, would almost entftelv funoed pj . PhRMA. The two groups spent $24 million advertising campaigns; contract produce place ads went White House Senior Advisor David AKPD, owed Axelrod $2 million. In next month, CEO's pharmaceutical companies would meet Baucus administration officials least four times. These talks preceded major public event White House, one critical strategy promote health care reform. On May 11, PhRMA trade industry groups piedaed cost , ..-v_itting_measures White House would save, claimed, upwards $2 trillion next decade. President Obama announced deal State Dining Room, flanked leaders various trade groups; administration followed media blitz press White House Web site. The next day, Healthy Economy Now's PhRMA funded ad campaign ran first advertisement support health care reform process calling government finally "fix" nation's health care cost problems. While many elements $2 trillion cost cutting pledge fell apart, drug industry remained committed process hopes could ultimately win defeat provisions feared closed-door meetings White House: The first occurred June 2. White House visitor logs show PhRMA's top executives, including Tauzin, industry CEOs met Sarah Fenn White House Office Health Care Reform. On day, publicly available schedule Senator Max Baucus shows Tauzin industry CEOs met Senate Finance Committee chairman. What ultimately resulted coordinated meetings would revealed Baucus June 20. In press release featuring statement Tauzin, Baucus revealed pharmaceutical industry accepted $80 billion cost cutting measures included Senate Finance Committee version bill. According news re_gorts, Baucus initially proposed $100 billion cost cutting measures, executives lobbyists meeting June 2 able win lower figure. The terms initial cost-cutting deal included $30 billion go directly towards closing "donut hole" Medicare prescription drug coverage. The "donut hole" term gap coverage occurs within Medicare prescription drug coverage. For purchasing prescription drugs Medicare program coverage cuts $2,700 spent pick back $6,154 spent participant. The amount proposed deal; 50 percent coverage drugs within coverage gap, however, would completely close "donut hole." In Baucus' press release, Tauzin quoted saying, "This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and, working together, make hope better tomorrow reality today." This "once-in-a-lifetime" opportunity also extended pharmaceutical industry's ability blunt long-term Democratic agenda lowering prescription drug prices Medicare negotiations, re-importation quicker release generics onto market. After making grand statement support cost cutting proposals time pharmaceutical industry finally force White House Democrats take certain chips table. Baucus proceeded a_pia,n c.c)r .ivene.a bicartisap rimuo effort craft bill desired White House. These participants included Democrats Kent Conrad Jeff Bingaman Republicans Chuck Grassley, Mike Enzi Olympia Snowe. Baucus' decision need solidify deals groups like pharmaceutical industry - reliant Baucus producing bill - slowed legislative process making impossible Congress meet White House's announced iltuouet reces§ dee&rie passing health care reform. Soon after, PhRMA's big guns industry lobbyists paid White House another visit July 7 time met Rehm Emanuel Jim Messina (Baucus' chief staff Jon Selib also listed White House visitor logs meeting). In August, The Huffirytorj. !Dosi',. --; Ryan Grim reported internal memo drafted meeting outlined policies would allowed final version health care reform. These included Medicare prescription drug negotiations, drug re-importation, lowering prices drugs available Medicare Part D Part B. The deal would $80 billion cost cutting absolutely more. *** While $80 billion deal cut Baucus' committee, congressional committees continued mark-up versions health care reform without knowledge White House relying Baucus produce final product. In House Representatives, House Energy & Commerce Committee leveled direct threat $80 billion deal. Energy & Commerce Chair Henry Waxman sought include provisions PhRMA gotten White House Baucus cut reform bill. These included drug reimportation. Medicare negotiating power speedier release generics market. According previous analysis measures proposed committee, measures would totaled hundreds billions cost cuts, far exceeding $80 billion cap agreed White House, Baucus PhRMA. The cost cutting measures passed Energy & Commerce bill spooked board PhRMA, included CEOs involved deal-cutting meetings White House Baucus. The board pressured Tauzin go public deal ensure White House would recognize renege. On August 4, Los Ancg•3les•Firrief- , - :, exclusive report, featured quotes Tauzin claiming deal White House PhRMA existed that, Tauzin put it, "The White House blessed it." Tom Hamburger wrote article, "For part, Tauzin said received White House pledge forswear Medicare drug price bargaining, also separate promise pursue another proposal Obama supported campaign: importing cheaper drugs Canada Europe." The White House's Jim Messina later confirmed Tauzin's claim, stating, "The president encouraged approach ... He wanted bring parties table discuss health insurance reform." Democratic lawmakers furious. Rep. Raul Grijaiva, chairman Progressive Caucus, asked, "Are industry groups going ones table get first big piece pie fight crust?" *** On September 7, Baucus' bill made private circulation Hill; pharmaceutical industry cost-cutting exceed $80 billion. Five days later, New York :limes reported PhRMA planned spend $150 million advertising blitz support Baucus' bill. The Times noted ad spending "...would follow-up deal drug makers struck June Mr. Baucus White House." On September 16, Baucus released full text les.j .islation public. The White House, PhRMA Baucus still fight battles keep deal intact. The key amendment targeting PhRMA deal committee mark-up came Sen. Bill Nelson Florida, one largest Medicare participant populations nation. The pull constituent needs clearly put Bill Nelson position push cost cutting Medicare prescription drug pricing. His target: closing "donut hole" completely. Nelson claimed amendment would onerate $106 billion revenue, PhRMA's perspective increase cost-cutting $186 billion. That would unacceptable PhRMA, Baucus, White House pharmaceutical industry made deal. Other Senate Democrats, Tom Carper Robert Menendez voted Republicans Baucus committee defeat amendment. It little surprise Carper's Delaware home AstraZeneca Menendez' New Jersey home Merck Bristol-Myers-Squibb, lobbied $80 billion cap. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid introduced final bill, cap place, November 19. Debate began Dec. 3, come one attempt members change terms deal. Senator Byron Dorgan introduced amendment would allow drug re-importation, date voting drew near, Federal Drug Administration (FDA) released letter objecting proposal echoed pharmaceutical industry talking points: "...as currently written, resulting structure would logistically challenging implement resource intensive. In addition, significant safety concerns." Dorgan's amendment defeated numerous Democrats previously support reimportation switching "no" votes. On Christmas Eve, bill passed Senate PhRMA deal fully intact. *** New Year's Eve passed action health care reform. Public opinion regarding health care reform bill slipping throughout 2009. It reached fulcrum special election replace deceased senator Ted Kennedy Massachusetts January 19, 2010. Newly minted senator Scott Brown campaigned would senator provide Republicans votes filibuster final health care reform bill. Democrats ran cover. Despite largest majorities party since 1970s, Democrats put brakes agenda, particularly health care reform. end, pharmaceutical industry's support health care reform would left air. After spending $100 million advertising support legislation Tauzin key executives hoped would windfall pharmaceutical industry, legislative process flat-lined. In February, board PhRMA, split deal cut Tauzin, pushedjauzin to_res ..i .s., .post. In interview Diane Sawvqf., President Obama owed failures process passing health care reform, "[The health care debate unfolded legitimately raised concerns among opponents, also amongst supporters don't know what's going ...

Who knows Petraeus would actually interest going politics, would introducing many voters first time. President Obama himself, according aides reported me, quite taken David Petraeus respects approach thinking. Petraeus also respectful President -- although pushed recent forum might react Presidential decision Afghanistan General might liked, Petraeus offered cryptic rather clear response.

Remember Eisenhower clinched Republican nomination promising President though knew war would end Korean War. Petraeus knows Afghanistan Iraq -- though seems hard envision today could kind leader promising end wars Obama proves unable so.

But General David Petraeus, business suit, lurks there. Obama seems concerned looking like weak national security. The Republicans -- Cheney's constant goading (and Sarah Palin's) -- seem want continue play politics fear-mongering. Obama could neutralize possibility faces Republican party challenge David Petraeus inviting General 2012 ticket Democrat. Crazy? Perhaps. But inviting potential rivals tent becoming standard Obama trademark -- much appointing Republican Governor Utah former G.W.

And get this, learned David Petraeus voted since 2002 -- doesn't care vote -- reportedly wants keep eventual political options political loyalties open. This soldier options table keeping powder dry.

sbwhoeop Tuesday, February 16, 2010 8:40 AM H: FYI: Les Gelb. S Replace Rahm Leslie H. Gelb February 15, 2010 I 10:48pm I ....7IKristoffer Tripplaar / SPA President Obama desperately needs sweeping staff shakeup save presidency. Leslie H. Gelb must reassign Rahm, dump Larry Summers, get rid National Security adviser Jim Jones. The negative, even dismissive, talk Obama White House reached critical point. The president must change key personnel now. Unless speedily sets new team, reduced speechmaker. It's mostly matter relocating Chicago campaign crowd surround Oval Office inserting people proven records getting things done Washington world. To fair, it's clear whether bad judgments priorities, practicalities, steadiness come Mr. Obama White House team. Maybe overpowers discussions, maybe gives role policymaking far beyond experience realm. Unless you're there, don't know. But Mr. Obama president, except right-wing crazies, Americans still recognize great talents promise. It who's got helped. So who've got go. It who's got helped. So who've got go. One may quarrel sense urgency here. But it's hard conversation opinion leaders anywhere—and especially Washington—that doesn't descend ripping Obama's White House team. The refrain complaints always same: • Obama forever taking strong stances backfill trim. Most recently, said "begrudge" Wall Streeters big earnings part market system. This, face saying couple weeks ago big bonuses "shameful." • Obama doesn't know what's really going on. Regarding Middle East, recently said "I think absolutely true year didn't produce kind breakthrough wanted, anticipated political problems sides earlier, might raised expectations high." He totally realize Palestinians Israelis nowhere close sitting dealing. • Obama wants get along everyone badly doesn't recognize real opposition sees it—let alone know deal it. He emerges meeting congressional Republican leaders health-care reform says "an eternal optimist—when Republican leaders told press don't see common ground believe administration "scrap bill start over." • It's even hard follow latest Afghan policy. He calls Afghanistan "war necessity" orders 30,000 new troops there, coupled announcement he'll begin withdrawing year plus, see advisers say start withdrawals say won't. I've scribbled similar points recent months The Daily Beast. And last week The Financial Times, Edward Luce provided thunderclap Washington's negative consensus incompetence Obarna's Chicago-laden team. Luce named names White House, number journalists bloggers strikingly failed link Luce story. They said fear wrath Chicagoans. Steve Clemons, author The Washington Note, essentially eridorse.d Luce finding slapped fellow bloggers' wrists hiding issue. The situation serious Carter administration. There, two capable political campaigners--Hamilton Jordan Jody Powell—moved critical White House positions without knowing much business Washington. And were, quite naturally, busy learn. They also added "them" versus "us" (Washington insiders bureaucrats versus regular guys Georgia) mentality plagues administrations. The Chicagoans others "guarding" president create "us versus them" world. It's hard imagine policy conversation president Chicago crowd, since none them, except Rahm Emanuel, Washington policy experience. And isn't much evidence bring strong-minded outsiders challenge president regular basis either. The result inexperienced president advised inexperienced team. Here personnel changes bruited political policy circles: First, remove Rahm Emanuel chief staff move senior political adviser slot. No one I've talked believes management skills discipline run White House. But terrific political mind fighter given new job time thing. Proven pros could step right include following: Erskine Bowles, president University North Carolina former Clinton chief staff; Leon Panetta, CIA director formerly White House chief well Clinton; Sylvia Mathews, former deputy chief staff also Clinton; John Podesta, another former Clinton chief heads Center American Progress. All four tough know manage. Replace Lawrence Summers, director White House's National Economic Council, Paul Volcker, former chairman Federal Reserve. Summers brilliant highly controversial; he's beaten said want anyway. Volcker unmatched stature, practical experience, courage lion. He one position get step-by-step brass tacks economy stop Mr. Obama's weekly gyrations. Others proven track records help inside outside advisers are: Stephen Robert, formerly head Oppenheimer, Vincent Mai, former leader AEA Investors, Tom Hill Blackstone. There also two economic stars Washington who'd improve policymaking public combat: Sheila Bair, chairwoman Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Elizabeth Warren, chair Congressional Oversight Panel. One outside adviser would help president see economic hard choices ahead: Peter G. Peterson, accomplished businessman policy head. David Axelrod, senior political adviser president, needs concentrate next presidential campaign, wherein expertise lies, domestic foreign policy, another smart unknowledgeable voice. Good replacements know politics Washington would aforementioned Podesta; Tom Deschle, former Democratic Senate Majority Leader. As David Plouffe, another senior campaign aide, unofficial residence White House, lodged nearby Executive Office Building. Senior adviser Chicago buddy Valerie Jarrett much part inner circle move, given limited role making policy. Mr. Obama's crowd appears think getting things done means giving another speech. It's nice, nearly enough. Robert Gibbs needs rest press secretary. Let's put way: He wasn't born daily jousts pithy Republicans. His job calls memorable pointed phrases attacks, circle-the-wagon circumlocutions. Possible successors? Try Doyle McManus L.A. Times, Jake Tapper ABC News, Helene Cooper The New York Times. Last least, James Jones, National Security Adviser, move on. The career Marine greatly admired respected Commandant Corps NATO's military chief. He handled duties great skill. But wide acclamation inside outside White House, emerged strategist—perhaps key requirement key position. The person job pull everything together—laying achievable objectives precise plans dispense carefully packaged carrots sticks. One Democrat could step now, despite age, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's national-security adviser. He first-rate strategic mind—a rare quality—and knows deliver results. Obama need iron Zbig's lack sympathy toward Israel Russia. Also available boatload first-class retired diplomats judgment background needed perform National Security Council job effectively. They would greeted applause home abroad. Try former ambassadors Thomas Pickering, Morton Abramowitz, Frank Wisner, Reginald Bartholomew, Winston Lord. They all. At minimum, others like form core group meets regularly Obama strategy. Yes, many pros suggested reached golden years. But 70 even 80 new 60. They possess necessary energy, experience rare skill delivering results. They also shovel-ready. As critical bonus, could would mentor next generation down, talented one indeed, succeed two three years. To lead America world, Obama grow far beyond present propensity treat problems intellectual puzzles—to collect facts hear arguments. The great tasks governing demand proven intuition sensing what's achievable, buttons push when, buy time power take hold, make adjustments without flagrantly foolish rhetoric, avoid failures diminish power, succeed small well large ways. With team versed arts skills, President Obama America would succeed. Leslie H. Gelb, former New York Times columnist senior government official, author powerRule,5-.

Gelb's call White House Chief Staff Rahm Emanuel reassigned spurred circle-the-wagons reaction pro- (or perhaps even anti-) Rahm forces. Gelb sifts fallout clues. When write president United States replace chief staff, someone fire back. So Rahm Emanuel apparently struck back piece last week Daily Beast column Sunday's Washington Post. Only time, return fire rare twist, one could produce Washington convulsions. It seemingly aimed (and others published suggestions Emanuel's limitations chief). But whether intentional not, volley actually struck president himself. Here story, Washington tale stretching permissible criticism power holders, pungent media leaks, labyrinthine speculation whom. Maybe leaker thought way get rid Rahm completely brand "traitor" boss. With headline "Replace Rahm," I wrote last Tuesday Emanuel lacked managerial skills, discipline, strategic ability get things done chief staff. I argued moved political adviser slot, considerable, can-do talents would better serve boss. I targeted others well, mostly Mr. Obama's Chicago crowd. Several writers also blasted crowd, mostly unsigned bullets, never crossed red line calling removal. I wrote piece essentially reflected waves anti-White House staff critiques breaking Washington, rarely heard outside drawing rooms. I I believed president running chances succeed needed better tougher staffers. I failed, nation failed. Then came inevitable blast back, devastating leak, piece Dana Milbank, respected Washington journalist. Interesting leaker selected Milbank. He's sort half-reporter, half-columnist roams entire capital city, White House. The leaker must felt safe Milbank many sources town, making leakers harder trace. The Milbank headline read: "Why Obama needs Rahm top." It began: "Let us praise Rahm Emanuel. No, seriously." Then, lists couple others also criticized Rahm. "But," continued, "sacking Emanuel last thing president do." Then, Milbank (and presumably leaker) delivered surprise wounding blow – president himself. "Obama's first year fell apart large part didn't follow chief staffs advice crucial matters. Arguably, Emanuel person keeping Obama becoming Jimmy Carter." Then, Milbank (and leaker) took first shot, me, congressional liberals everyone Chicago crowd except Rahm. "Obama's problem," Milbank continued, "is confidants—particularly Valerie Jarrett Robert Gibbs, and, lesser extent, David Axelrod—are part Cult Obama. In love president, believe transformational figure needn't dirty hands politics." So, "their" fault—until see real blow landed beyond President himself. "The president would better heeding Emanuel's counsel," instead "overruled" several key Rahm recommendations: rushing close Guantanamo bringing terrorists U.S. prisons, trying Khalid Sheikh Mohammed New York, going smaller health care bill focused popular items Republican support. "The result was," Milbank wrote, "as world knows, disastrous." In words, Mr. Obama could thrived saved key issues listened Rahm. It sure looks like Rahm (or someone near dear him) trying save president's expense. This incredibly unusual leak, seemingly chief staff undermining boss, president. Worse, details specific advice Rahm personally gave Mr. Obama absolute privacy Oval Office. Presidents go crazy breaches confidence. Which another possibility considered: Rahm leaker. The leak egregious, anti- Chicago crowd minus Rahm, devastating president, Emanuel couldn't stupid enough leak story sole, surviving hero. Remember, too, piece recommend kicking Rahm White House, sliding political adviser job could practice small-bite pragmatism. Maybe someone didn't want Rahm around White House all, position. Maybe leaker thought way get rid Rahm completely brand "traitor" boss. Maybe leaker belonged contingent self- mutilating liberal Democrats always viewed Rahm centrist pragmatic. Of course, I don't know what's afoot. And course, Milbank put views article. But someone gave specifics, precious ammunition Rahm's private advice Mr. Obama. The story over. Leslie H.

Soaring cost healthcare sets record By Noam N. Levey February 4, 2010 Los Angeles Times Spending 17.3% economy last year. The share paid U.S. soon exceed 50%, study says. In stark reminder growing costs, government released new estimate healthcare spending grew record 17.3% U.S. economy last year, marking largest one-year jump share economy since government started keeping records half century ago. The almost $2.5 trillion spent 2009 $134 billion previous year, healthcare consumed 16.2% gross domestic product, according annual report independent actuaries federal Centers Medicare Medicaid Services, CMS, scheduled release Thursday. The nonpartisan accounting agency also projected early next year, country could mark another milestone government picks half nation's total healthcare tab first time. The rise current costs, driven part surging spending Medicare Medicaid, bleak projections future take account changes may come Democrats revive healthcare overhaul legislation. The report appears likely fuel debate health bills stalled Congress. In absence change, report raises grim prospect country -- healthcare system consuming ever greater potentially unsustainable share economy even private health coverage lags. Last year, CMS estimated government spending healthcare would overtake private spending 2016, compared 2011 2012 current report. "The health system hurting, seeing numbers," said Karen Davis, president Commonwealth Fund, leading authority healthcare policy. The report also points financial cost so-called Great Recession growing pressure putting state local governments. Federal state spending Medicaid, nation's primary health insurance program low-income Americans, jumped nearly 10% 2009, according report. Medicare spending, meanwhile, shot 8%.

Fueled new technology, aging population, rising incomes changes, spending medical care consuming larger larger share nation's economy years, jumping 5% gross domestic product 1960 nearly 14% 2000. But recession began 2007 accelerated trend, economy contracted healthcare spending continued increase, according CMS. Even now, economy slowly recovering, government expects growth healthcare spending outpace expansion economy. By 2020, 1 every 5 dollars spent U.S. expected go healthcare. Some economists believe necessarily problem, healthcare industry provide good jobs improve health productivity. But growing concern much third medical care delivered country help patients. "Are getting value dollar? That question," said Len Nichols, health policy director centrist New America Foundation. "If believe much medical care unnecessary, I do, criminal spending much." Stuart Butler, vice president domestic economic policy conservative Heritage Foundation, said numbers underscore need aggressive action curb spending. "The way simply spend less," Butler said, warning health bills pushed Capitol Hill opposite. CMS officials noted healthcare spending increasing even number Americans without health insurance growing, another sign problems system. "With higher unemployment, people lose jobs [and] many lose healthcare coverage process. And current law, don't much fall back on," said Richard S. Foster, chief actuary. Foster said report office indicated two main trends driving calls health overhaul -- rising costs shrinking numbers people health coverage -- essentially healthcare debate began last year. "Nothing much changed regard," said. Inefficiency becoming particularly acute problem state federal governments, report shows increasingly supporting nation's healthcare system. Half century ago, government accounted quarter healthcare spending. Now, cost caring elderly poor Americans swells, government's share total bill fast becoming greater private sector.

EU leaders debate Blair presidency summit sidelines Climate talks overshadowed divisive subject Tony Blair's candidacy Europe's first president European government chiefs gather Brussels evening summit likely first occasion broach divisive subject Tony Blair's candidacy Europe's first president. The topic formally agenda meeting dominated wrangling climate change funding get Czech president, Vaclav Klaus, add final signature reformist Lisbon treaty. But senior diplomats predicted would intense private discussion fringes summit question: get plum job first sitting president European council, pre-eminent EU forum brings leaders together summits least four times year. David Miliband, foreign secretary, said today Blair would give Europe "strong voice" global stage, comments seized Conservative shadow, William Hague, said debate presidency proved UK held referendum Lisbon treaty. Officially, job exist Klaus finalises Czech ratification treaty, expected within weeks. While Blair personally kept quiet ambitions, British government campaigning increasingly assertively former prime minister's behalf. "We making case strong, internationally known figure open doors [foreign] capitals," said official. "There one candidate." That reference Jean-Claude Juncker, veteran Luxembourg prime minister European fixer, contender far openly declared candidacy. He emerged week anti-Blair. Juncker looks certain fail bid top job. But may well succeed destroying Blair's chances, viewed stalking horse vanish make way third unknown contender. While Blair debate rages sidelines summit, big priority Swedish government chairing meeting try break deadlock EU funding climate change programmes developing world ahead Copenhagen conference December. Berlin Warsaw keys deal, prospects breakthrough look dim. Fredrik Reinfeldt, Swedish prime minister, warned Europe's credibility global warming stake. In recent weeks European governments locked horns financing package unable reach agreement. The aim come pledges EU fund €15bn (£13.4bn) year 2020 transfers developing countries combat global warming. The overall package central Copenhagen deal. But big players, especially US, reluctant commit figure, Germany believes Europe show hand Copenhagen negotiations. The European commission others UK Scandinavians believe agreeing figure advance would strengthen Europe's global leadership role climate change send strong signal potential signatories. The Poles eastern Europeans unhappy asked stump developing countries Brazil, wealthier poorer EU members. The Poles refusing agree package figures Copenhagen unless first decided bill split among EU's 27 governments. In midst financial crisis, eastern Europeans say cannot afford climate change fund. Angela Merkel, sworn yesterday second term German chancellor, pivotal climate change financing deal answer Blair question may also decisive. So far, hedging bets. While Nicolas Sarkozy, French president, known support Blair reservations, German candidates two big new jobs created Lisbon — European president European foreign minister high representative foreign security policy. In Paris last night French German leaders discussed posts, although little information whether reached pact. Sarkozy said two leaders agreed "almost everything". Austria, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg — said nurse ambitions secure presidential post — come publicly Blair grounds would neglect interests smaller EU member states — 19 total 27. Adding voice argument, Demitris Christofias, president Cyprus, said council president "from small country would objective consensual. The European Union family compromises." The Dutch centre-right prime minister possible contender, Jan-Peter Balkenende, come pressure week renounce European presidential ambitions since move Brussels could trigger early elections fall government. Christofias emphasised tonight priority would get Klaus blocking Lisbon treaty lifted rather focusing gets Lisbon. Senior diplomats agreed early discuss names. If Klaus signs thetreaty soon, special summit would convened next month decide president foreign minister, also leaving European commission chief, Jose Manuel Barroso, put together new team.

sbwhoeor Sunday, November 29, 2009 1:0S PM H Re: Another memo backdrop week. Sid November 28, 2009 Editorial Diplomacy 101 We thrilled President Obama decided plunge fully Middle East peace effort. He appointed skilled special envoy, George Mitchell, demanded Israel freeze settlements, Palestinians crack anti-Israel violence Arab leaders demonstrate readiness reach Israel. Nine months later, president's promising peace initiative unraveled. The Israelis refused stop ail building. The Palestinians say won't talk Israelis do, President Mahmoud Abbas despondent threatened quit. Arab states refusing anything. Mr. Obama's credibility diminished (his approval rating Israel 4 percent) serious negotiations may farther ever. Peacemaking takes strategic skill. But see sign President Obama Mr. Mitchell thinking one move board. The president went public demand full freeze settlements securing Israel's commitment. And aides apparently plan would Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said no. Most important, allowed controversy obscure real goal: nudging Israel Palestinians peace talks. (We don't know exactly happened told Mr. Obama relied judgment political advisers — specifically chief staff, Rehm Emanuel -- Mideast specialists.) The idea made sense: side something tangible prove serious peace start negotiations. But Mr. Netanyahu refused total freeze, President Obama backed down. Mr. Netanyahu since offered compromise 10-month freeze exempts Jerusalem, schools synagogues permits Israel complete 3,000 housing units already construction. The irony offer goes beyond past Israeli governments accepted, Mr. Obama called more. And Palestinians promptly rejected compromise. Washington isn't one blow it. After pushing President Obama lead peace effort, Arab states, especially Saudi Arabia, refused make concessions settlements halted. Mr. Mitchell asking allow Israel fly commercial planes Arab airspace open trade office. They also done far little strengthen Mr. Abbas, weak leader still best hope negotiating peace deal. Ditto Washington Israel. All raises two questions: What President Obama learned experience improve diplomatic performance generally? And plan revive peace talks? The president choice keep trying. At point extremists try provoke another war. absence dialogue make things worse. Advancing final-status plan two-state solution one high-risk way forward think worth gamble. Stalemate unsustainable.

Rescue teams pulled survivors five-star hotels, university buildings, supermarket UN headquarters, Port-au-Prince's better neighbourhoods. In poor areas, damage appears much greater, apparently forgotten victims report Twitter yet encounter first foreign rescuer. Many aid workers reported orders venture without armed guards — all, long debates UN military command. The UN lost number staff quake, keen risk lives. But Haitian people seem scare aid workers Somali warlords, Darfuri Janjawid Afghan Taleban. Frightened Dutch aid workers abandoned mission without•reaching collapsed building people trapped, frightened doctors left patients unattended.

UN "rules engagement" apparently stopped providing security doctors. The Belgians took medical supplies them, keep claws robbers. Dr Gupta camera team stayed night, monitored abandoned patients' vital signs continued intravenous drips — robbed. Some rescuers leaning much toward security allow people die. The media helping. CNN rules rubble. "Outside military conflict, biggest international deployment since tsunami 2004," according Tony Maddox, managing director CNN International. So image aid operation beamed back primarily Ameridan — one big problems American view Haiti. CNN won't stop telling aid workers outside world pillaging (the incidence — first four frustrating days least — compare happened Hurricane Katrina) dangerous distribute food, likelihood "stampedes". Nor US Government, biggest player aid operation, anything help relax atmosphere. On contrary. When President Obama said US aid effort would "aggressive" meant it. The humanitarian operation led civilian agencies, Pentagon. Mr Obama ordered 9,000 troops fleet nuclear-powered ships move in. Victims war Congo (which cost five million lives past years) genocide Darfur would love much American attention — Haiti's fate lay America's backyard sore American eyes decades already.

Furthermore, 28% think Conservative leader wants best "all groups Britain", 39% prime minister. Peter Kellner, president YouGov, Sunday Times pollster, said individual polls could throw unexpected shifts, recent trend significant narrowing Tory lead. "Our daily polls regarded bit like FTSE index: 100-point rise fall day might blip trend — often can't tell days," said. "I confident Tory lead weekend I can't promise whether latest movement sustained, increased reversed days ahead. One reasons daily polls monitor fluctuations." The Tory lead 6%, first reported The Sunday Times, maintained YouGov's polls The Sun last week. The increase support Labour Thursday Friday, latest Sunday Times poll conducted, came figures showed strengthening economic recovery. Under British parliamentary system, prime minister remains office general election either tenders resignation defeated Commons confidence vote. If election result leaves Labour short overall majority, Brown likely battle on, Labour running country minority government. The party would seek deals minor parties Ulster's Democratic Unionist party or, necessary, Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats, get legislation parliament. If repeated general election basis uniform swing constituencies, today's poll would leave Labour nine seats short 326 needed overall majority new 650-seat House Commons. The Tories would well behind 263 seats, Liberal Democrats 41. Kellner calculated that, even allowing larger swing Tories marginal seats, party spent millions pounds campaigning, poll consistent Labour far largest party. He suggested scenario Labour might win 300 seats, Tories 270 Lib Dems 50. Labour believe benefiting upturn economy. For first time YouGov poll since July 2007, financial crisis, people trust Labour Tories run economy. YouGov, began polling 2001 election, developed reputation accuracy. Its final Sunday Times poll 2005 precisely right, accurately predicted Boris Johnson's victory 2008 London mayoral election results last year's Euro elections.

FYI: Jan 12, 2010 » Mobile Home » Top Stories Inside Reid eruption By Mike Allen & Glenn Thrush I 1/12/10 @ 12:19 AM EST Harry Reid isn't talkative. But Senate majority leader chatted freely two disarmingly charming book authors came office Capitol shortly 2008 election. They — tape recorder — soaking reminiscences wild campaign turned backbencher caucus president United States. Reid wasn't guard — perhaps he'd told staff meeting would "off record," according person knowledge exchange. Although Reid master Senate's mysterious inside game, he's often botched outside game one colleague calls "penchant saying things without filter." But Jim Manley, Reid's senior communications adviser, wasn't worried boss sat John Heilemann New York Magazine Mark Halperin Time magazine — two veteran reporters working publisher billed "a sweeping, novelistic, ultimately definitive portrait" 2008 race. Like virtually every Washington political insider, Manley long warm relationship Halperin, longtime political director ABC News set conventional wisdom Washington "The Note." Maybe Reid Manley — thinking back many candid exchanges years — simply assumed Halperin wouldn't burn boss. Or maybe expected Halperin would check back quotes planned use? Whatever thinking, wrong. Reid talking reasons why, even though publicly professed neutrality vicious Democratic primaries 2008, secretly encouraged then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama challenge another member caucus, then-New York Sen. Hillary Clinton. And amid talk Obama's oratorical gifts, let slip something else: Obama could win White House "light-skinned" African-American "with Negro dialect, unless wanted one." The authors write "Game Change," published weekend, Reid made remark "privately." They say said them. As chagrined Reid telephoned political allies Senate civil rights community shore support weekend, made clear felt burned authors. In book's"Authors' Note," wrote: "All interviews — junior staffers candidates — conducted 'deep background' basis, means agreed identify subjects sources way. We believed essential eliciting level candor book sort depends." Heilemann said MSNBC's "Morning Joe": "We clear agreement sources interviews would deep background.... Our ground rules ... won't identify sources sources material. But said clearly put scenes book, uttering dialogue people book part scene, would identify utterer words." Halperin added: "There's one talked book burned way, violated agreement with." Manley, Capitol Hill veteran also worked late Sen. Ted Kennedy, responsible monitoring interview dealing issues arising it. But didn't tell anyone else Reid's inner circle inflammatory remarks boss made; good relationship authors, assumed quotes would never made public — least without knowing first. Manley declined comment story-- wouldn't confirm interview took place. On Friday 10 p.m. — half year interview — The Atlantic's Marc Ambinder e-mailed Reid's staff questions "light-skinned" candidate without "Negro dialect." In second-guessing followed, Capitol Hill veterans said way inflammatory words Senate majority leader would remain record, even arrangement. But Manley sounded internal alarm, rest damage-control squad caught flat- footed Ambinder's e-mail, several people close situation told POLITICO. "They could weeks prepare try convince Halperin run it," said Democrat participated damage control. Now staff blindsided revelation that, mishandled, could politically fatal. Manley aides worked 2 a.m. Saturday draft Reid's carefully written apology, emphasized record African- American issues. "I deeply regret using poor choice words," 90-word statement began. Later Saturday, Manley helped lead counteroffensive, calling White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, friend days communications director Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, set apology call Reid, home Searchlight, Nev., Obama back Washington. In stunning "Statement President" e-mailed reporters 3:55 p.m. Saturday, Obama said: "Harry Reid called today apologized unfortunate comment reported today.... As far I'm concerned, book closed." Relieved president's solid backing, Reid's aides decided toughest challenge would prevent prominent African-American Democrats attacking Reid harshly — calling resignation. Reid's team correctly anticipated Republicans would demand head. Keeping criticism becoming bipartisan drumbeat key. The team calculated long attacks looked like partisan shouting, Reid would benefit. Aides say boss quickly understood danger spent much Saturday working call list 30 prominent African-Americans across country. On calls, apologized words argued book's main takeaway quietly supported Obama Clinton, long made feelings public. Among called Rev. Al Sharpton; longtime civil rights leader Julian Bond; Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), chairwoman Congressional Black Caucus; political consultant talk-show fixture Donna Brazile; House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.); Wade Henderson, CEO Leadership Conference Civil Rights; Hilary Shelton, director NAACP's Washington office. The extent damage already shaky reelection chances Nevada won't known November. But Monday, Reid believed Washington storm passing. From home New York, Sen. Chuck Schumer telephoned Reid Nevada offered organize letter support Democratic senators. Reid decided unnecessary. He confidently concluded now, least, won inside game.

Possibility Senate Run, Nurtured Abandoned By MICHAEL BARBARO March 03, 2010 New York Times A weeks ago, Harold E. Ford Jr. telephone conversation friend Doug Band, powerful counselor former President Bill Clinton. Mr. Ford, former Tennessee congressman works Wall Street, wanted discuss potential challenge Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand New York's Democratic primary, possibility flirted weeks. But Mr. Band encouraging. He told Mr. Ford Democrats reeling political setbacks across country, would bad party career entered race. "It's right thing do," said, according person direct knowledge conversation. A Ford spokesman confirmed call denied Mr. Ford discouraged running told would hurt party. The spokesman said Mr. Band told White House pressured Mr. Clinton supporting Ms. Gillibrand. Mr. Ford's decision run Senate, disclosed Tuesday, came reached dozens donors, advocates political leaders. In private conversations, worries emerged: race Ms. Gillibrand would brutal fight, dominated endless debates began paying taxes New York resident sincerity support gay marriage abortion rights. A campaign hoped would focus tax cuts job growth would instead, feared, become mired discussions "who got first, meant most," social issues, told associate. That might allow Republican opponent swoop take seat bloodied Democratic nominee. What seemed weigh him, interviews dozens people met spoken advisers revealed, status carpetbagger moved New York Tennessee, rather reality easy constituencies grab to, outside Wall Street, worked since moving 2006. Many spoke condition anonymity want seen disclosing private conversations. As hopscotched city city, charming crowds bits Southern biography, signs trouble Mr. Ford emerged. His voting record Congress put right fringes state Democrats, $2 million-a-year job Merrill Lynch made hard run Scott Brown-style populist. What seemed like improbable, even impossible campaign roots conversations, many dating back year, among Mr. Ford, 39, coterie powerful friends New York City, Washington Los Angeles. Over dinner last July Post House, clubby steakhouse Upper East Side, Richard Plepler, co-president HBO, urged Mr. Ford restart political career New York. "I think give serious thought," said, Senate race. Mr. Ford replied would. After dinner, Mr. Plepler sent e-mail message Douglas E. Schoen, top Democratic pollster, bounce idea him. Mr. Schoen intrigued, studied public polls, became convinced Mr. Ford's best shot reaching Senate wage campaign Ms. Gillibrand. Over next months, Mr. Ford sounded many New York's wealthiest politically connected executives, frequently breakfast Regency Hotel Park Avenue: Robert Wolf, head United States investment banking division UBS; Ronald Perelman, billionaire chairman Revlon; Steven Rattner, founder Quadrangle, private equity firm, big Democratic donors. Mr. Rattner told Mr. Ford, also political analyst NBC, money would problem. "You raise money," told December. Yet several big-name donors warned Ms. Gillibrand, relentless campaigner, beaten punch. "She already locked lot Wall Street up" message Marc Lasry, billionaire hedge fund manager, conveyed Mr. Ford telephone conversation. As Mr. Ford traveled outside New York City, especially upstate, found political support Ms. Gillibrand shallow, hunger change palpable. The mayor Syracuse, Stephanie Miner, told residents "scared desperate" economy, told Mr. Ford Ms. Gillibrand rare presence city. But Ms. Gillibrand's strategy portraying Mr. Ford showboating out-of-towner starting stick. In late January, head Brooklyn Democratic Party, Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, held luncheon Mr. Ford, invited local lawmakers. During two-hour question-and-answer session, Marty Markowitz, borough president, pointed several up-and-coming state senators around room observed greater experience New York politics Mr. Ford. "With due respect," asked Mr. Ford, "why think takes New York's senator?" Even lawmakers seemed open Ford candidacy warned peeling away support Ms. Gillibrand would harder seemed. Ruben Diaz Jr., Bronx borough president, told Mr. Ford bites omelet diner near office, "It's difficult make strong case here." Ms. Gillibrand, explained, secured $4 million worth federal stimulus money train constituents green jobs. Mr. Ford knew liberals would attack relatively conservative voting record but, spoke said, taken aback depth anger encountered advocates abortion rights gay marriage. After reporters found examples Mr. Ford calling pro-life time Congress, Mr. Ford vehemently pushed back, saying always supported woman's right choose. He assumed would put matter rest. It not. "He dumbfounded kept tripping up," friend said. One Mr. Ford's top advisers, Bradley Tusk, campaign manager Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's 2009 re-election, arranged meeting Mr. Ford close Bloomberg ally, Kelli Conlin, head Naral-Pro Choice New York. Mr. Ford expected polite conversation would help neutralize foe. Ms. Conlin, however, started meeting quizzing Mr. Ford voting record public statements. Did realize, asked, backed legislation would outlaw late-term abortions even woman's health danger? Far conciliatory, Mr. Ford wanted know Naral allowed Ms. Gillibrand vote health care bill cut financing abortions. "You gave pass," said. Before leaving, Mr. Ford told Ms. Conlin chose run hoped return ask group's support. Ms. Conlin responded: "We never support take positions." Mr. Ford "looked shocked," person room said. His meeting gay rights advocates Feb. 24 rockier still. When walked headquarters Stonewall Democrats Chelsea neighborhood Manhattan, greeted signs read "Liar!" "Go home snake oil Harry," reference recent support gay marriage twice voted outlaw Congress. A days later, results poll Mr. Ford paid pocket began trickle in, giving advisers pause. His negative ratings increased slightly. A liberal primary electorate seemed wary portions record. Ms. Gillibrand remained vulnerable, data showed, Mr. Ford's chance seemed 50-50. "It slam dunk, all," said person spoke briefed data. Mr. Tusk told associates win, Mr. Ford needed 80 percent state's black vote, tall order, inconceivable African-American Democratic primary. But end week, Gov. David A. Paterson Representative Charles B. Rangel become embroiled ethics scandals. New York's black political elite seeming disarray, needed organized unified. By Sunday, made mind run. He told wife, Emily, father, former Representative Harold Ford Sr. He began call friends next evening, leaving many brief messages. "I'm going run time," said one message. "Thank support."

March 15, 2010 Op-Ed Columnist Taking On China By PAUL KRUGMAN Tensions rising Chinese economic policy, rightly so: China's policy keeping currency, renminbi, undervalued become significant drag global economic recovery. Something must done. To give sense problem: Widespread complaints China manipulating currency — selling renminbi buying foreign currencies, keep renminbi weak China's exports artificially competitive — began around 2003. At point China adding $10 billion month reserves, 2003 ran overall surplus current account — broad measure trade balance — $46 billion. Today, China adding $30 billion month $2.4 trillion hoard reserves. The International Monetary Fund expects China 2010 current surplus $450 billion — 10 times 2003 figure. This distortionary exchange rate policy major nation ever followed. And it's policy seriously damages rest world. Most world's large economies stuck liquidity trap — deeply depressed, unable generate recovery cutting interest rates relevant rates already near zero. China, engineering unwarranted trade surplus, effect imposing anti-stimulus economies, can't offset. So respond? First all, U.S. Treasury Department must stop fudging obfuscating. Twice year, law, Treasury must issue report identifying nations "manipulate rate exchange currency United States dollar purposes preventing effective balance payments adjustments gaining unfair competitive advantage international trade." The law's intent clear: report factual determination, policy statement. In practice, however, Treasury unwilling take action renminbi unwilling law requires, namely explain Congress isn't taking action. Instead, spent past six seven years pretending see obvious. Will next report, due April 15, continue tradition? Stay tuned. If Treasury find Chinese currency manipulation, what? Here, get past common misunderstanding: view Chinese us barrel, don't dare provoke China dumping dollar assets. What ask is, What would happen China tried sell large share U.S. assets? Would interest rates soar? Short-term U.S. interest rates wouldn't change: they're kept near zero Fed, won't raise rates unemployment rate comes down. Long-term rates might rise slightly, they're mainly determined market expectations future short-term rates. Also, Fed could offset interest-rate impact Chinese pullback expanding purchases long-term bonds. It's true China dumped U.S. assets value dollar would fall major currencies, euro. But would good thing United States, since would make goods competitive reduce trade deficit. On hand, would bad thing China, would suffer large losses dollar holdings. In short, right America China barrel, way around. So reason fear China. But do? Some still argue must reason gently China, confront it. But we've reasoning China years, surplus ballooned, gotten nowhere: Sunday Wen Jiabao, Chinese prime minister, declared — absurdly — nation's currency undervalued. (The Peterson Institute International Economics estimates renminbi undervalued 20 40 percent.) And Mr. Wen accused nations China actually does, seeking weaken currencies "just purposes increasing exports." But sweet reason won't work, what's alternative? In 1971 United States dealt similar much less severe problem foreign undervaluation imposing temporary 10 percent surcharge imports, removed months later Germany, Japan nations raised dollar value currencies. At point, it's hard see China changing policies unless faced threat similar action — except time surcharge would much larger, say 25 percent. I don't propose turn policy hardball lightly. But Chinese currency policy adding materially world's economic problems time problems already severe. It's time take stand.

Sid http://www.tnr.corniarticie/world/the-crisis?page=0,0 Ea Published The New Republic Was Obama's confrontation Israel premeditated'? Yossi Klein Halevi 4. March 16, 2010 17:13 pm JERUSALEM—Suddenly, city feels like war zone..Since suicide bombings ended 2005, life Jerusalem part relatively calm. The worst disruptions traffic jams resulting construction light rail. jUst like normal city. But navy, again, clusters helmeted border nOtiCe near gates Old City. black smoke burning tires Arab village across porch, young men marching green Islamist flags toward neighborhood, ambulances parked strategic places ready city's ultimate nightmare. The return menace Jerusalem mid-level bureaucrat announced stage four seven-stage process eventual construction oft,600 apartments Ramat Shiomo. Jewish neighborhood northeast Jerusalem. Such announcements building projects become routine years Paestinians scarcely responded, let alone violently. In negotiations Palestinians Israelis, permanence Ramat Shiomo, Jewish neighborhoods East Jerusalem, given. Ramat Shlomo, located Jewish neighborhoods French Hill Rarrot, remain within boundaries Israeli Jerusalem accord ng every peace plan. Unlike Snail Jewish enclaves inserted Arab neighbochoocis, Israelis strongly buliding established Jewish neighborhoods East Jerusalem defines national consensus. Why, then, outbreak violence now? Why Harness "day rage" Jerusalem Palestinian Authority's call gather Temple Mount "save" Dome Rock non-existent plans build Third Temple? Why sudden outrage rebuilding synagogue, destroyed Jordanians 1948, Old City's Jewish Quarter, dozens synagogues yeshivas built quarter without incident? The answer lies Jerusalem Washington. By placing issue building Jewish neighborhoods East Jerusalem center peace process, President Obama inadvertently challenged Palestinians less. Astonishingly. Obama repeating key tactical mistake failed efforts restart Middle East peace talks last year. Though Oben-la's insistence settlement freeze help restart negotiations legitimate, went step far including building East Jerusalem. Every Israeli government last four decades built Jewish neighborhoods East Jerusalem; government, let alone one headed Likud, could possibly agree freeze there. Obama made resumption negotiations hostage demand could met. The result Palestinian leaders forced adjust demands accordingly. Obama directly responsible one absurd turns history Middle East negotiations. Though Palestinian leaders negotiated Israeli governments built extensively West Bank, refused sit first Israeli government actually agree suspension building. Obama's demand building freeze Jerusalem led freeze negotiations. Finally, intensive efforts, administration produced pathetic achievement "proximity talks"—setting Palestinian-Israeli negotiations back generation, time Palestinian leaders refused sit table Israelis. That Obama could guilty amateurishness perhaps forgivable was, ail, amateur. But taken failed policy intensified it. By demanding Israel stop building Ramat Shlomo elsewhere East Jerusalem—and placing demand center American-Israeli relations—he's ensured Palestinians won't show even proximity talks. This longer amateurishness; pique disguised policy. Initially, announcement building Ramat Shlomo made, Israelis shared Vice President Biden's humiliation outraged government's incompetence. The widespread sense Netanyahu deserved administration's condemnation, didn't do: He failed convey parts government need caution Biden's visit, symptomatic chaotic style governing generally. But even opposition accused Netanyahu deliberate provocation. These days Yitzhak Shamir, former Israeli prime minister used greet visit Secretary State James Baker announcement creation another West Bank settlement. Netanyahu placed need strategic cooperation U.S. Iranian threat ahead right-wing political agenda. That's included Labor Party coalition, accepted two-state solution—an historic achievement set Likud, however reluctantly, within mainstream consensus supporting Palestinian statehood. The last thing Netanyahu wanted embarrass Biden goodwill visit trigger clash Obama ultra-Orthodox neighborhood. Nor likely deliberate provocation ultra-Orthodox Shas party, runs interior ministry oversees building procedures. Shas, supports peace talks territorial compromise, nationalist party. Its interest providing housing constituents, like future residents Ramat Shlomo; provoking international incidents style. Finally, ordinariness building procedure—the fact construction Jewish East Jerusalem considered Israelis routine—is perhaps best proof intentional ambush Biden. Apparently one interior ministry could imagine long-term plan Ramat Shiomo would sabotage state visit. In turning incident crisis, Obama convinced many Israelis merely seeking, pretext pick fight Israel. Netanyahu inadvertently shabby; Obama, deliberately so. Ac.t,cording banner headline newspaper Ma'ariv, senior Likud officials believe Obama's goal topple Netanyahu government, encouraging Labor Party want quit coalition. The popular assumption Obama seeking prove resolve leader getting tough Israel. Given ineffectiveness Iran tendency violate self-imposed deadlines sanctions, Israeli public likely impressed. Indeed, Israelis' initial anger Netanyahu turned anger Obama. According Israel Radio poll March 16, 62 percent Israelis blame Obama administration crisis, 20 percent blame Netanyahu. (Another 17 percent blame Shas leader Eli Yishai.) • In last year, administration publicly condemned Palestinians lack good faith—even though Palestinian Authority media has, example, waging months-long campaign denying Jews' historic roots Jerusalem. Just Biden left Ramailah, Palestinian officials held ceremony naming square city terrorist responsible massacre 38 Israeli civilians. That didn't merit administration rebuke. Obama's one-sided public pressure Israel could intensify atmosphere "open season" Israel internationally. Indeed, European Union reaffirmed linking improved economic relations Israel resumption peace process—as it's Israel rather Palestinians refused come table. If administration's main tactical error Middle East negotiating emphasizing building Jerusalem, main strategic error assuming two-state solution within easy reach. Shortly Obama took office, Rehm Emanuel vvas quoted Israeli press insisting Palestinian state would created within Obama's first tent. instead, year later, era suspended proximity talks. Now administration demanding Israel negotiate final status issues proximity talks way convincing Palestinians agree talks--as Israelis would agree discuss future Jerusalem Palestinian leaders refuse even sit them. To insist imminent possibility two-state solution requires amnesia. Biden's plea Israelis consider withdrawal approximation 1967 borders exchange peace ignored fact Israel made offer twice last decade: first, Prime Minister Ehud Barak accepted Clinton Proposals December 2000, recently Prime Minister Ehud Olmert renewed offer Mahrnoud Abbas. Abbas, says Olmert, never replied. The reason Palestinian rejection two-state solution deal would require Palestinians confine return descendants 1948 refugees Palestine rather Israel. That would prevent two-state solution devolving bi-national, one-state solution. Israel's insistence survival remains obstacle peace. To achieve eventual peace, international community needs pressure Palestinian leaders forgo claim Haifa Jaffa confine people's right return future Palestinian state--just Jews need forgo claim Hebron Bethlehem confine people's right return state Israel. That possible deal: conceding right return Greater Israel exchange right return Greater Palestine. A majority Israelis—along political system—has accepted principle. On Palestinian side, political system rejected it. In absence Palestinian willingness compromise right return, negotiations focus two- state solution limited goals. There positive signs change Palestinian side last years. The rise Hamas created panic within Fatah, result is, first time, genuine security cooperation Israel. Also, emergence Salem Fayyad Palestinian prime minister marks shift ideological pragmatic leadership (though Fayyad still lacks power base). Finally, West Bank economy growing, thanks part Israel's removal dozens roadblocks. The goal negotiations point conflict encourage trends. But focusing building Jerusalem, Obama undermined possibility too. To fictitious notion peace process, Obama added fiction intransigent Israel blocking peace process. The administration, according report Israeli ne\Aispaper Yedito Aharonot, making even insidious accusation Israel. During visit, wrote Yediot Aharanot, Bicien told Israeli leaders policies endangering American lives Afghanistan Iraq. The report denied White House. Whether remark made, clear today Jerusalem Obama's recklessness endangering Israeli--and Palestinian-- lives.

Sid Labour c.uIi win seats eneral election, poll shows Guardian/ICM poll reveals gap two main parties four points — closest ICM poll almost two years • Julian Glover • aardian.co.uk, Monday 5 April 2010 19.02 BST • Article history Lbr still fighting chance winning seats general election, according Guardian/1CM poll published today. The findings suggest Tory hopes defining breakthrough overplayed, gap two main parties four points — closest 1CM poll almost two years. Labour support climbed four points 33% since ICM poll carried Guardian last week. Conservative backing dropped one since 37% — Labour's best ICM rating since December 2008 Tories' worst since February. On uniform national swing, figures could leave Labour 30 seats short overall majority. Even Tories perform better average marginal seats — people expect — David Cameron would struggle establish secure parliamentary basis power. Either party could left dependent fiber:a) Democrats, 21% poll — two last week. Despite decline, Lib Dems pleased strength position going election. The party 20% seven year's 11 ICM polls. Meanwhile support parties, peaked last spring European elections, fallen 9%. At start election campaign likely see polling ever British politics, today's figures treated caution unless confirmed surveys. Some polls late last week suggested Conservative lead grown rather shrunk, research may affected Easter holidays, voters would away home. Yet results suggest Labour's chances written off, events leaders' debates could prove decisive coming weeks. Today's poll suggests 60% people planning watch least one debate, 29% saying plan watch three. Only 39% voters said would watch them. The ICM survey also asked voters whether might switch away first choice party and, so;who might back instead. Labour Tory support equally solid. Overall, 71% Labour supporters say definitely back Labour 71% Tories also say stick first choice party. Lib Dems, however, less loyal — 52% sure end giving Nick Clegg vote. That leaves quarter main party's supporters considering backing another party. The proportion Lib Dems ConservatIves. saying might vote Labour instead doubled since ICM last asked question earlier year. The ICM figures suggest maximum potential vote Labour Conservatives — definite supporters, plus potential switchers — running neck neck 42%. The Lib Dem maximum 28%. Realistically, Labour unlikely beat 2005 share 36% even today's poll suggesting shed three points since surprise many. Nonetheless, play contest begins now. •ICM Research interviewed random sample 1,001 adults aged 18 telephone 1-3 April 2010.

sbwhoeop Saturday, March 20, 2010 5:54 PM H: fyi. sid H: Uri Avnery, Israeli analyst activist, privately circulating analysis today. One consequence: Petraeus cannot run Republican. At least Putin didn't bring big dogs like Merkel. Cheers, Sid Uri Avnery 20.3.10 The Doomsday Weapon IT IS already commonplace say people don't learn history condemned repeat mistakes. Some 1942 years ago, Jews province called Palaestina launched revolt Roman Empire. In retrospect, looks like act madness. Palestine small insignificant part world-wide empire won crushing victory rival power — Parthian Empire (Persia) — put major rebellion Britain. What chances could Jewish revolt have? God knows going mind "Zealots". They eliminated moderate leaders, warned provoking empire, gained sway Jewish population country. They relied God. Perhaps also relied Jews Rome believed influence Senate would restrain Emperor, Nero. Perhaps heard Nero weak fall. We know ended: three years, rebels crushed, Jerusalem fell temple burned down. The last Zealots committed suicide Masada. The Zionists indeed try learn history. They acted rational way, provoke great powers, endeavored every situation attain possible. They accepted compromises, every compromise served basis next surge forward. They cleverly utilized radical stance adversaries gained sympathy whole world. But since beginning occupation, mind become clouded. The cult Masada become dominant. Divine promises start play role public discourse. Large parts public following new zealots. The next phase also repeating itself: leaders Israel starting rebellion new Rome. WHAT BEGAN insult Vice President United States developing something far bigger. The mouse given birth elephant. Lately, ultra-right government Jerusalem started treat President Barack Obama thinly veiled contempt. The fears arose Jerusalem beginning term dissipated. Obama looks like paper black panther. He gave demand real settlement freeze. Every time spat on, remarked raining. Yet now, ostensibly quite suddenly, measure full. Obama, Vice President senior assistants condemn Netanyahu government growing severity. Secretary State Hillary Clinton submitted ultimatum: Netanyahu must stop settlement activity, East Jerusalem included; must agree negotiate core problems conflict, including East Jerusalem, more. The surprise complete. Obama, seems, crossed Rubicon, much Egyptian army crossed Suez Canal 1973. Netanyahu gave order mobilize reserves America move forward diplomatic tanks. All Jewish organizations US commanded join campaign. AIPAC blew shofar ordered soldiers, Senators Congressmen, storm White House. It seems decisive battle joined. The Israeli leaders certain Obama would defeated. And unusual noise heard: sound doomsday weapon. THE MAN decided activate foe new kind. David Petraeus popular officer United States army. The four-star general, son Dutch sea captain went America country overrun Nazis, stood early childhood. In West Point "distinguished cadet", Army Command General Staff College No. 1. As combat commander, reaped plaudits. He wrote doctoral thesis (on lessons Vietnam) Princeton served assistant professor international relations US Military Academy. He made mark Iraq, commanded forces Mosul, problematical city country. He concluded order vanquish enemies US must win hearts civilian population, acquire local allies spend money ammunition. The locals called King David. His success considered outstanding methods adopted official doctrine American army. His star rose rapidly. He appointed commander coalition forces Iraq soon became chief Central Command US army, covers whole Middle East , except Israel Palestine (which "belong" American command Europe). When person raises voice, American people listen. As respected military thinker, rivals. THIS WEEK, Petraeus conveyed unequivocal message: reviewing problems AOR (Area Of Responsibility) — includes, among others, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq Yemen — turned called "root causes instability" region. The list topped Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In report Armed Services Committee stated: "The enduring hostilities Israel neighbors present distinct challenges ability advance interests AOR...The conflict foments anti-American sentiment, due perception U.S. favoritism Israel. Arab anger Palestinian question limits strength depth U.S. partnerships governments peoples AOR weakens legitimacy moderate regimes Arab world. Meanwhile, al-Qaeda militant groups exploit anger mobilize support. The conflict also gives Iran influence Arab world clients, Lebanese Hizballah Hamas." Not content that, Petraeus sent officers present conclusions Joint Chiefs Staff, In words: Israeli-Palestinian peace private matter two parties, supreme national interest USA. That means US must give one-sided support Israeli government impose two-state solution. The argument new. Several experts said less past. (Immediately 9/11 attacks, I wrote similar vein prophesied US would change policy. It happen then.) But stated official document written responsible American commander. The Netanyahu government immediately went damage-limitation mode. Its spokespersons declared Petraeus represents narrow military approach, doesn't understand political matters, reasoning faulty. But made people Jerusalem break cold sweat. AS IS well known, pro-Israel lobby dominates American political system without limits — almost. Every American politician senior official mortally afraid it. The slightest deviation strict AIPAC line tantamount political suicide. But armor political Goliath chink. Like Achilles' heel, immense might pro-Israel lobby vulnerable point that, touched, neutralize power. It illustrated Jonathan Pollard affair. This American-Jewish employee sensitive intelligence agency spied Israel. Israelis consider national hero, Jew duty people. But US intelligence community, traitor endangered lives many American agents. Not satisfied routine penalty, induced court impose life sentence. Since then, American presidents refused requests successive Israeli governments commute sentence. No president dared confront intelligence chiefs matter. But significant side affair reminiscent famous words Sherlock Holmes dogs bark. AIPAC bark. The entire American Jewish community fell silent. Almost nobody raised voice poor Pollard. Why? Because American Jews ready anything — anything — government Israel. With one exception: anything appears hurt security United States. When flag security hoisted, Jews, like Americans, snap attention salute. The Damocles sword suspicion disloyalty hangs heads. For them, ultimate nightmare: accused putting security Israel ahead security US. Therefore important repeat endlessly mantra interests Israel US identical. And comes important general US Army says so. The policy present Israeli government endangering lives American soldiers Iraq Afghanistan. FOR NOW, said side remark, military document widely aired. But sword drawn scabbard - American Jews started tremble distant rumble approaching earthquake. This week, Netanyahu's brother-in-law used doomsday weapon. He declared Obama "anti-Semite". The official newspaper Shas party asserted Obama really Muslim. They represent radical right allies, argue speech writing "Hussein" Obama Jew-hating black must beaten coming congressional elections next presidential ones. (Yet important poll Israel published yesterday shows Israeli public far convinced insinuations: vast majority believes Obama's treatment Israel fair. Indeed, Obama got higher marks Netanyahu.) If Obama decides fight back activate doomsday weapon - accusation Israel puts lives American servicemen risk - would catastrophic consequences Israel. For time being, shot across bow - warning shot fired warship order induce another vessel follow instructions. The warning clear. Even •present crisis somehow damped down, inevitably flare long present coalition Israel stays power. When movie "Hurt Locker" won awards, entire American public united concern lives soldiers Middle East. If public becomes convinced Israel sticking knife back, disaster Netanyahu. And him.

sbwhoeop Tuesday, April 13, 2010 6:35 PM H: If poll holds, Labour majority. 1st debate thu. Sid • Print page From Times Online April 14, 2010 Tory lead narrows amid huge voter disenchantment, Times poll finds olmage :1 20, Peter Riddell The general election race tightening, according Populus poll The Times reveals deep public disenchantment campaign far. The poll, undertaken yesterday morning, says voters hoping hung parliament either Tory Labour outright victory. Conservative support slipped three points past week 36 per cent, Labour point 33 per cent. The Liberal Democrats unchanged 21 per cent. The polls tend fluctuate couple points either way. shifts within margin error average. With new polls pointing firming Labour support, party may enjoyed small boost manifesto launch. Tory strategists hope achieved boost manifesto launch today. If Populus figures repeated general election three weeks' time, uniform switch votes, Labour would largest single party, 300 MPs, ahead Tories 264 Lib Dems 54. This would point Lab/Lib Dem coalition. But many analysts expect uniform national swing. The latest poll shows 32 per cent public hope hung parliament (as opposed expecting one), 28 per cent wanting Tory majority 22 per cent Labour one. Lib Dem voters prefer deal Labour Tories hung parliament, 44 31 per cent. The public evenly split 40 42 per cent whether want Labour Tories either majority minority government. The poll shows number expecting Tory overall majority risen three points 34 per cent past week. This exceeds number expecting hung parliament, 33 per cent, six points compared week ago. Overall, 57 per cent expect Tories largest party, 29 per cent expecting Labour be. The public deeply sceptical honesty parties. Only 4 per cent think completely honest tax plans, 61 per cent partly honest. Only 6 per cent say completely honest cutting deficit 61 per cent partly honest. Some 7 per cent say completely honest extent fund policies cutting waste 58 per cent partly honest. Voters asked say party proposed eight key manifesto pledges. They wrongly identified four: reducing increase national insurance contributions (naming Labour Tories); allowing unsuccessful schools, hospitals police (the Tories, Labour); tightening takeover rules (the Tories Labour); requiring foreign workers employed public services speak fluent English (the Tories Labour). In one case, £150-a-year tax break, half voters (60 per cent) correctly identify party making proposal. In cases, pledge make little difference people's votes, apart three made Labour: foreign workers language pledge, doubling paid paternity leave allowing takover unsuccessful schools, hospitals etc. More two fifths (43 per cent), including 50 per cent women, say "none parties", "don't know", asked party putting across convincing cases voters. This compares 25 per cent naming Tories 18 per cent Labour. Just half public (54 per cent) plan watch first televised leaders' debate Thursday evening. Men middle class professionals likely say view. More two fifths (42 per cent) expect David Cameron win debate, 22 per cent Gordon Brown. More Tories (70 per cent) Labour voters ( 57 per cent) expect leader win. Two fifths public (42 per cent, one point week ago) say seems like change Labour, sure time change Conservatives. Some 33 per cent, one point, think time change Tories.

He ridiculously accused us anti-agreement party. Our delegation robustly reminded deputy first minister party brought power-sharing government Stormont.

This devotion "constructive ambiguity" hallmark U.S. peacemaking Palestinian-Israeli issue 40 years. Rather state unpalatable concessions analysts recognize required viable settlement -- Israelis must share sovereignty Jerusalem Palestinians must give "right return" Israel -- successive U.S. administrations tried defer unmentionables later. But fog machine blew apart month, isr3e1Interipr i‘,1!inista_rndLinced du ..ripq. visit ily__Vde President Biden Israel would build 1,600 housipg priits ,lerusal. erp. The Obama administration upset, put mildly: Secretary State Hillary Clinton called housing announcement "deeply negative signal" U.S.-Israeli relations "an insult." In ensuing hubbub "crisis" U.S.-Israeli relations, frantic attempts pretend misunderstanding pull cloak ambiguity back peace process. But that's mistake. The East Jerusalem move wasn't accident emphatic public statement Israeli right's rejection concessions Jerusalem. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu trying play along U.S. requests fuzz issue avoiding provocative actions Jerusalem. But right-wing Shas party, controls Interior Ministry, basically called bluff. "Freezing building East Jerusalem one things cannot do," said Dore Gold, right-wing former Israeli ambassador United Nations. And Avigdor Lieberman, Israeli foreign minister settler himself, responded: "Can imagine told Jews New York could build buy Queens?" So administration do, Israeli right put Jerusalem squarely table despite best efforts ambiguity-addicted diplomats? The administration's best strategy considered year ago, state clearly basic principles must frame negotiations. Those guidelines articulated well Zbigniew Brzezinski, former national security adviser: real sharing Jerusalem; right return Palestinians; return 1967 borders, mutual adjustments allow big Israeli settlement blocks; demilitarized Palestinian state. Every negotiation past four decades converged toward parameters. The Obama administration debated whether issue statement principles year ago, began peacemaking effort. Launching negotiations "big bang" made sense officials, including Gen. Jim Jones, national security adviser, But George Mitchell, Middle East envoy, argued based experience Northern Ireland peace talks, better let parties haggle United States stepped bridging proposals. Rather stating U.S. negotiating principles outset, Obama team decided instead push Netanyahu settlements. The administration picked fight flush President Obama's first months office, confident strong Netanyahu weak came showdown, Netanyahu would cave. The Israeli leader coolly bided time, dickering procedural issues Obama got weaker politically month. Netanyahu finally agreed November temporary moratorium new settlements -- excluded Jerusalem. The administration seen coming. In retrospect, seems clear step-by-step approach mistake: Constructive ambiguity, case, proved destructive. It allowed Israeli right wing perpetuate idea could -- obtain peace deal without making concessions Jerusalem. And allowed Netanyahu continue straddle. Jerusalem hardest issue Israeli-Palestinian negotiation, reason, would-be peacemakers wanted save last. But month's crisis makes strategic waffling impossible. Thanks Israeli right, Jerusalem issue joined. What's needed Obama announce negotiations begin, United States state views Jerusalem key issues -- sketching outlines deal Israelis Palestinians want. If Netanyahu refuses play, real crisis U.S.-Israeli relations. davidignatius_@washpost.corn Post Comment View comments posted article.

Nationalists unionists Stormont parliament voted together create new justice ministry, completing last act Good Friday agreement. But discord inside Stormont parliament Conservatives' allies Northern Ireland, Ulster Unionists, 18-strong assembly team, voted move.

The deputy first minister, Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness, earlier denounced UUP stance, claiming intended embarrass DUP. "The UUP declared last night support resolution," McGuinness told assembly. "That saddens disappoints me. They opposed view transfer cynical party political reasons." In statement vote, Gordon Brown praised parties backed deal. "Today politics progress finally replaced politics division Northern Ireland," prime minister said.

Alistair Carmichael, spokesman Northern Ireland, said: "With UUP saying one thing, Tories saying complete opposite, voters struggle understand exactly joint Tory-UUP candidates stand for. What we're seeing Tories complete disarray. When takes George Bush step voice reason, it's clear David Cameron dug big hole." Carmichael added: "This raises serious questions David Cameron's judgment. If can't manage steer straight course opposition, earth would cope prime minister?"

Memo Mr. Obama: When man charged crimes humanity tells world America pocket, it's time review policy. Perhaps Obama administration caved considers flawed election better election. That's reasonable view, one I share. It's conceivable Mr. Bashir could won quasi-fair election - oil revenues manifestly raised standard living parts Sudan - campaigning create space sharp criticism government. It's also true Sudan behaving better respects. The death toll Darfur hugely reduced, government negotiating rebel groups there. The Sudanese government gave visa travel permits Darfur, allowing travel legally freely. The real game isn't, fact, Darfur elections maneuvering possible new civil war. The last north-south civil war Sudan ended fragile peace 2005, two million deaths. The peace agreement provided referendum, scheduled take place January, southern Sudanese decide whether secede. They expected vote overwhelmingly form separate country. Then question becomes: north allow South Sudan separate? The south holds great majority country's oil, it's difficult see President Bashir allowing oil fields walk away. "If result referendum independence, going war - complete war," predicts Mudawi Ibrahim Adam, one Sudan's outspoken human rights advocates. He cautions America's willingness turn blind eye election-rigging increases risk Mr. Bashir feel get away war. "They're naïve Washington," Mr. Mudawi said. "They don't understand going on." On hand, senior Sudanese government official, Ghazi Salahuddin, told unequivocally Khartoum, nation's capital, Sudan honor referendum results. And it's certainly plausible north south muddle avoid war, sides exhausted years fighting. Here Juba, South Sudan capital, I met Winnie Wol, 26, fled civil war 1994 militia north attacked village kill, loot, rape burn. Her father many relatives killed, escaped made way Kenya - eventually resettled refugee California. She lives Olathe, Kan., returned first time Sudan visit mother sisters last seen little girl. Ms. Wol, every bit well-dressed American, let tag along journey back village Nyamlell, 400 miles northwest Juba. The trip ended thatch-roof hut belonged mother, didn't know coming - one home. Ms. Wol crushed. Then scream woman came running. It Ms. Wol's mother, somehow recognizing her, flew other's arms. To me, felt like peace dividend. Yet peace fragile, Ms. Wol knows northern forces may come back pillage again. "I don't want war," said, "but I don't think allow us separate." My hunch north hasn't entirely decided do, strong international pressure reduce risk another savage war. If President Obama ever going find voice Sudan, better soon.

Faced government incompetence corruption, people rebelling. By Max Blumenthal Dec 4, 2002 I The body another murdered woman found late last month Mexican industrial hub Ciudad Juarez, dumped behind shrubs squalor Anapra neighborhood, ramshackle hodgepodge corrugated tin cardboard shacks sludge-washed banks Rio Grande. Her hands tied, evidence suggested raped. The body badly decomposed investigators calculated she'd dead seven months. However horrific details, numbing familiarity. The body woman died similar circumstances found dusty lot couple months earlier. The bodies eight women found lot far away little year ago. So many women murdered past 10 years reliable count. Most experts place close 325, average 32 year, nearly three every month. At least 90 deaths believed work one serial killers. Hundreds women simply vanished. Like many others, woman whose body found late October probably come Juarez poverty southern Mexico work $10 day one many foreign-owned assembly plants known maquiladoras sprouted Juarez North American Free Trade Agreement signed 1994. And like them, too, body unclaimed death buried alone anonymous. Such death become way life here. So, too, fear paranoia rise climate. Nobody knows killings, mystery seems deepen. Arrests made local authorities produced allegations torture, witness tampering frame-ups -- convictions. Most believe killer killers must enormous clout. Perhaps, say, killers narcotrafficantes disposing witnesses. Perhaps sons wealthy powerful indulging sick sex. Perhaps cultists whose members come highest levels government finance. The theories differ, common assumption arrests made thus far smokescreen historically opaque corrupt government protect dark secrets cost. One thing seems clear: The murders arise social landscape transformed global economic forces. Where Ciudad Juarez small, sleepy desert outpost across border El Paso, Texas, population past decade exploded 1.2 million people, many drawn lure maquiladoras. The tides people overwhelmed ability city absorb them, overwhelmed health services, social services law enforcement. Free-trade advocates promised NAFTA would transform Juarez City Future -- proven right way never could imagined. Today, Juarez still feel lawless Old West, grim 21st century edge. Despite promises swift justice Mexican President Vicente Fox Chihuahua Gov. Patricio Martinez, yet take offers assistance FBI; bureau agents Texas suggested official corruption hindering efforts stop murders. Chihuahua state investigators seemingly adopted "don't ask, don't tell" policy towards Juarez's homicides, fostering atmosphere impunity pervasive fear. Foreign corporations operating Juarez employed many murdered women largely deny atmosphere exists. But postmodern urban culture, concept community broken down, many bereaved family members local activists begun take matters hands, investigating murders speaking even means threats reprisals. Evangeline Arce's daughter, Silvia, street vendor, disappeared Nov. 3, 1998. Since day, said, authorities done little investigate. "Two days daughter disappeared, I went police filed report," mother says Spanish, face flaring anger. "They promised prompt action I checked back week later, Missing persons report never filed investigation even begun. When finally got witnesses together, none would talk afraid." Even Mexico continues make strides toward becoming open democratic society, epidemic rape murder exposed heavy residue corrupt authoritarian political legacy well contradictions efforts economic expansion. To understand magnitude breakdown, think sniper rampage Washington area fall left 10 people dead three wounded. Imagine Montgomery County Police Chief Charles Moose held press conference asked local citizens catch sniper local police task federal government helpful; imagine federal government charged local officials Montgomery County complicit killings impeding investigation. Chaos would ensue, certainly. But then, multiply. number victims 30, 40, 50, more. That's Juarez today. The jumbled, exhaust-choked commercial core city grown wildly wake NAFTA, adding modern shopping malls, condominiums expansive boulevards. The population growing twice rate national average; expected nearly double 2010, 2 million people. Many directly indirectly rely 300 maquiladoras livelihoods. To accommodate new army workers, city given birth entirely new sectors. The Campestre Juarez luxurious conglomerate gated communities, main gate that's life-size replica Paris' Arc de Triomphe. Nearby, many maquiladoras situated along Avenida de la Industria. Though assembly-line workers sometimes glimpsed behind plate glass window aqua-blue uniforms, usually little sign activity behind maquiladoras' featureless walls. Most new residents poor, brink poverty, live Anapra another grim, violent colonias populares outskirts town. In colonies, residents usually live without sanitation, running water, electricity paved roads. Avenida Manuel Gomez Morin pothole-riddled six-lane avenue ties varied worlds together. Sitio Colosio Valle, medium-sized strip mall, stands corner avenue gateway industrial sector. It fronted vast parking lot inside various clothing outlets boutiques. By day, lot bustles customers scurry back forth, hauling purchases cars -- sight similar mall suburban United States. By night, however, traffic tapers off, stores lock mall's lot becomes dark desolate. Sitio Colosio Valle many slain missing women last seen. In mall's parking lot, Braulio Rosas, 40-year-old security guard, leans door giant Nike outlet. Inside store, bright fluorescent lights, employees frantically check inventory scramble close up. "A lot girls picked here," Roses says voice calm resignation. "But really, it's girls' fault. It's even though weren't putas, [prostitutes] know, like fad/es [easy women]. They didn't get cars didn't want to." Rosas sounds cynical, blaming victims means aberration Juarez. Similar notions offered officials like Suly Ponce, former Chihuahua special prosecutor charge murdered women's cases. "Sometimes cases girl meets person, strikes relationship her, drink ... ends violently," told Washington Post 2000, promoted job governor's office. "It's difficult know." A handful women found murdered since 1993 indeed confirmed prostitutes. But truth large majority missing murdered women hardworking, young, poor part socially conservative. Most migrated Juarez Mexico's depressed south work maquiladoras, sometimes arriving alone little means contacting families back home. The maquiladoras, run companies like Delphi RCA Thomson, prefer hire young women assembly-line jobs. An entry-level assembly-line worker makes minimum wage, $2 hour. With experience, pay rise much $2,50 hour -- compared wages Guerrero Chiapas, that's good money. But Juarez, women caught economic trap: Since cost living slighter lower El Paso, wages seem high new maquiladora workers actually ensure poverty. The workers hired fired spot, little pretext legal protection. And union activities prohibited. Even accept conditions, security elusive. More often now, global companies maquiladoras closing shop transferring operations China take advantage lower taxes, investment subsidies outrageously cheap labor. On June 29, Royal Philips Electronics announced moving P.C. monitor manufacturing operations, cost 900 jobs. On July 1, Scientific Atlanta fired 1,300 workers shutting plant down. According Nov. 5 New York Times, trend cost Juarez 287,000 jobs maquiladoras since peak October 2000. Not slash burn economic base. There brutal social reverberations, too. The city's health system, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, reported 200,000 people falling list insured losing company policies, according July article La Prensa. Esther Chavez Cano, director Juarez's battered- women's shelter, Casa Amiga, said speech summer domestic violence cases risen 50 percent July alone. The combination poverty lack social connections renders women assembly line powerless virtually invisible. And made easy prey. According El Paso Times, third approximately 325 slain women employed maquiladoras time murder. Given maquiladoras provide shuttle service colonies, female workers often preyed upon walking perilous places like Sitio Colosio Valle darkness early morning. At hour, nearby activity bars nightclubs closing male patrons filter street long night drinking. Besides China's attractive economic climate, intangible cause maquiladora flight Juarez's chronic violence. The effect difficult measure. Two companies city's industrial sector -- including TDK, audio tape maker -- posted banners factories reading: "STOP THE VIOLENCE. To Better Our City, Let's Unite." But foreign companies purely economic organisms governed entirely, seems, dictates efficiency. They maintained stunning silence even female workers slaughtered. Consider case 17-year-old Claudia !vette Gonzalez. Her body found November 2001 along seven others overgrown cotton field Avenida Technologico, blocks Sitio Colosio Valle mall across street offices Association Maquiladoras. She worked assembly line Lear Corp., Detroit-based auto-interior supplier. Lear declined publicly address Gonzalez's murder. Greg Bloom, editor Frontera Norte Sur -- Internet news service focuses U.S.-Mexico border -- recalled conversation Gonzalez's mother, Josefina, recounted daughter's last day. In darkness early morning, Gonzalez told him, Claudia set job Lear. When arrived work minutes late missing bus, Claudia lvette promptly sent away policy barring tardy assembly-line workers shifts. A half-hour past usually would returned home, mother knew something gravely wrong. Her worst fear -- nagging fear shared many Juarez mothers -- would soon realized. Andrea Puchalsky, Lear's director communications, acknowledged company made public statements regarding Gonzalez's murder, enacted proactive measures protect employees another wave violence. "Adding security question relates Lear," said. "[Gonzalez's murder] happen Lear property." When questioned murder Lear policies, Puchalsky mentioned company memo prepared responses possible questions. As Lear's worker-lockout policy, apparently put Gonzalez precarious situation day abduction, Puchalsky declined comment whether Gonzalez locked sent home Lear's plant last day. "We policy tardiness tardy many times," Puchalsky said. "When arrived late work shift, time work shift." When asked whether Lear's offices U.S. similar policy late employees barred working shifts, Puchalsky reversed earlier statement, vehemently denying policy existed anywhere within Lear's operations. "There policy send worker home X number tardy arrivals," said. "Typically someone arriving late kind warning system, might notification 'the next time arrive late, take day ...' It's policy, though. There written policy like throughout Lear Corp." The body 17-year-old Lilia Alejandra Garcia found mutilated 300 feet maquiladora February 2001, since case come embody incompetence corruption police prosecutors Ciudad Juarez state capital Chihuahua City south way Mexico City. Garcia, mother 5-month-old baby 2-year-old child, apparently kidnapped left work. She held captivity week, repeatedly beaten raped, strangled. Then-prosecutor Suly Ponce told Juarez newspaper El Diario Garcia first woman year murdered raped area city - - even though two days before, body unidentified woman found naked blocks away. When FBI leak revealed witness testimony linking Lilia Garcia's killers drug dealers, Suly Ponce dismissed it, calling erroneous. She instead blamed workers circus across street strip mall Garcia last seen. When circus managers claimed Ponce offered money blame co-workers, dropped investigation. According July article El Paso Times, former Chihuahua state forensic chief Oscar Maynez Grijalva said Garcia killed similar manner three eight women found cotton field Claudia 'vette Gonzalez November 2001. Curiously, local authorities behaved evasively investigation Garcia's. When Gonzalez seven women's bodies found November 2001, ex-Chihuahua Attorney General Arturo Gonzalez Rascon immediately fingered two local bus drivers culprits. Yet doubts guilt arose, especially Grijalva -- Rascon's evidence expert time -- resigned post, citing pressure fabricate evidence them. And head local prison forced office documented signs torture accused men returned Rascon's office. Four months later, February 2002, search-and-rescue team combing cotton field found Claudia lvette Gonzalez's overalls plastic bag, along strands hair crucial pieces evidence Rascon's investigators failed discover. In response, Rascon offered opinion El Paso Times: "The state police done thoroughly professional job. I doubt that." But Oct. 28, DNA results revealed Rascon's investigators properly identified one eight dead women -- Gonzalez. Stuck far dubious task catching one madman replacing one feeble leader, Juarez's fractured civil society paralyzed. A cynical mood palpable speaking citizens street, unanimously express fear distrust law-enforcement government officials. Some local cops cynical. "We can't sit around deserted places waiting someone drive dump bodies off," said one municipal police officer seated idling paddy wagon refused give name security reasons. "There us city's big ... We don't get much support federal government. Judicially, protected like cops U.S. Plus, arms give us weak bulletproof vests don't really stop bullets. It's that, though. I young woman home I put place parents lost daughters. But it's question society. We need support need conscious going get better here." The scope crime enormous, little success stopping it, suspicion breeds itself. The litany theories killers motive might suggests Juarez become breeding ground every imaginable predator. And yet, nobody knows. Nothing certain. And feeds climate paranoia. Garcia Gonzalez's murders rumored work serial killer possible ties drug dealers. Yet Garcia found marks wrists that, according local forensics experts, identical made police handcuffs. And upon discovery daughter's overalls, Josefina Gonzalez told El Paso Times someone powerful undoubtedly responsible murder. Many Mexico's law enforcement community agree ring rich men behind killings, evidence support theory. Some suggest young men local aristocracy responsible, protected parents. A persistent theory holds murders -- significant subset -- linked powerful narcotraficantes co-opted segments local ruling class. And cynicism exacerbated fact 17 men one woman accused serial killer masterminds murders, one convicted, Abdel Latif Sharif Sharif, Egyptian chemist resident Texas time extradition Mexico 1995. Currently, Sharif awaiting sentencing allegedly paying drug trafficker named Victor Manuel Rivera Moreno carry dozen murders. However, evidence Sharif suspect charges changed repeatedly. Once even charged killing woman, Elizabeth Ontiveros, showed later police offices prove alive. In 1996, Sharif accused paying gang Los Rebeldes kill 17 women. Then, 1999, charged hiring five bus drivers El Paso man jail cell kill seven women. Officials claimed Sharif hired killers deflect blame himself. By 1999, judges cleared charges, citing absence concrete evidence possibility witness intimidation prosecutors. Suly Ponce, supervised case, yet make compelling case him. In 1999 radio interview, rather presenting hard evidence, claimed Sharif aggressively hostile toward women Egyptian background. Now says case Sharif hinges Moreno's declaration Sharif paid carry killings money earned 13 patents developed Benchmark Research Technology. But according article El Paso Times, Benchmark never paid employees patent development. In telephone interview last week Salon, Ponce said hadn't known this. Angela Paiaveras, current special prosecutor, declined discuss Sharif's case aspect investigations. Many local residents scoff notion killers caught. "We don't believe guys arrested killers," says Miguel Angel Jaramillo, mid-level manager Lear Corp. "It's obvious they're scapegoats." Yet Ponce remains ardent belief Sharif center murders. "Today killings continue many imitators," told Salon last week. "But Sharif caught, almost homicides year." But according Juarez daily El Diario, year immediately Sharif jailed -- period spanning October 1995 October 1996 -- 28 young women found murdered. Meanwhile, theories flourish become paranoid, reflecting breakdown public trust. By one popular theory, women murdered blood rituals cabal wealthy, powerful men. Another theory posits financial motive murder. "We're finding lot girls mutilated way," says young municipal police officer declined give name. "Someone's probably killing take organs sell lot money U.S." When asked evidence support theory, officer replied hunch. Such climate sends message killers every day: You get away anything, even crime scale. But climate breeds cynicism hopelessness among people live work here, also provoked incipient revolt. On radio show "Grueso Calibre" ("Large Caliber"), popular host Samira lzaguirre frequently aired views guests critical authorities handled murders. When Attorney General Rascon accused two bus drivers cotton field murders November 2001, lzaguirre hosted drivers' wives show. After interview, advertisements began appearing local newspapers smearing lzaguirre claims frequented strip clubs romantically involved one bus drivers. News media sides border reported receipt ad signed government officials paid it. Then, February, lzaguirre started organizing vigil announced hunger strike show Radio Canon, fired. Fearing safety, moved across border El Paso. Others, too, discovered pressing complaint forcefully brings reprisal. Marisela Ortiz, co-director Nuestras Hijas Regreso Casa (Our Daughters Back Home), legal support group victims' parents, frequent guest "Grueso Calibre." Like Izaguirre, Ortiz focused resources drawing attention government police incompetence slain women's cases. And says that, like lzaguirre, faced ever-increasing danger. In Nuestras Hijas' office central Juarez, located inside small one-story row house "For Rent" sign front, Ortiz described shadow terror stalked since began pressuring authorities. She claims threatened ex-Chihuahua District Attorney Arturo Gonzalez Rascon. "Rascon came way Juarez [from Chihuahua City] tell involve cases," tells Salon. "Then I got message phone saying: 'You daughters alive. Take care them." Rascon, earlier story Associated Press, denied allegation. Last May, Ortiz says, pursued men black pickup truck tried kidnap her. She believes attempt orchestrated Rascon's office since occurred day planned travel El Paso meeting FBI Texas state Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, D-El Paso, calling bi-national investigation murders. Victims' parents came Nuestras Hijas help finding missing daughters also say threatened. Mario Lee Lopez wife, Soledad Aguilar, lost daughter, Cecilia Covarrubias. She kidnapped 1995 along granddaughter, two months old. By granddaughter would 7, Lopez Aguilar's investigation led believe alive living custody well-connected local family. To outsider desperate story, impossible prove. Lopez accuses Ponce coordinating coverup kidnappings murder: again, Ponce denies charge. And adamant government officials harassed one. "I didn't knowledge threats anybody," said. "On contrary, support families encouraged intimately involved investigations." Lopez recalls incident gone Juarez's judicial building press granddaughter's case exactly find kind support Ponce mentioned. While leaving court, Lopez says, confronted high- ranking minister warned didn't drop investigation, would tortured electric shock devices. "But it's late stop now," Lopez adds wistful smile. Despite campaign lzaguirre, perhaps it, vigil took place scheduled March. It unprecedented show solidarity, thousands people gathered cotton field Gonzalez seven others found irrigation ditch. There still tatters yellow police tape there, candleholders left vigil strewn site. Eight red crosses mark spot bodies found. However, city officials plans memorialize site Juarez's residents have. In fact, according Sept. 4 article El Diario, site used dumping ground Juarez's Department Parks Gardens. Near downtown Juarez monument Abraham Lincoln, honoring "establishing North American industries, today important world." Not far away simple gallery Collective Antigone [Antigone Collective], group local artists, organized series public performances, installations conferences focused Juarez's crisis violence. Each week, artists gather collaborate discuss strategy. At table 12 artists writers, expansive room filled cubist-inspired paintings, Antonio Munoz Ortega, 51-year-old writer, describes Collective's goals problems confronting group. "Our government authoritarian, authoritarian governments principally concerned manipulation life," says. "The victims' families feel manipulated authorities' insensitivity manifested greater greater cynicism that's really dangerous. The struggle, then, reparation simply regaining daily lives." Ortega says moved action Samira Izaguirre's candlelight vigil March. He describes building impromptu church front Association Maquiladoras office effort "communicate different language, one that's symbolic." This decision, says, helped lead formation Collective. The rallying cry Collectiva Antigona, evidenced name, Sophocles Greek tragedy, "Antigone," tells tale girl's persecution hands cruel dictator burying brother. The Collectiva organized readings play around state Chihuahua plans public performance future. The Collectiva also begun establish visual presence around central Juarez, noticeably painting wall spanning entire block poetry written participants recent writer's conference violence women. On Nov. 1 2, Mexican holiday Dia de los Muertos, collective filled room traditional altars honoring victims along giant cross center room covered masks, intended symbolize anonymity victims. An estimated 1,500 people viewed exhibit. A week later, working Nuestras Hijas, collective placed coffin flowers bonfire cotton field ditch Claudia Ivette Gonzalez seven others found. "It absolutely necessary affect civil society intention shaking indolence provoke sort reaction people," says Mariela Paniagua, 41-year-old painter. "People longer affected happening city. They lost capacity outrage face acts." While Collectiva Antigona meets, another group gathers miles away combat Juarez's violence drastically different means. Past seemingly endless rows cardboard hovels desperately poor CoIonia Morelos, beyond municipal dump, rocky desert mesa shadow Mount Indio, members search-and-rescue group called Banda Civil spread hills search murder victims. Luz Elena Guerrero Guerra, strong-looking woman late 50s intense gaze, serves president one Banda Civil's six divisions. Guerra tells began search-and-rescue group 1985 assist massive earthquake Mexico City evolved respond Juarez's crisis. She found first slain women's bodies 1989, investigators even identified deadly trend. Today, Banda Civil's members still lend help natural disasters bulk work comes search bodies, monitoring schools citywide crime- awareness campaign. Ever-present terror, coupled impotence Juarez's authorities, forced Banda Civil's transformation, Guerra says. "I've narrowly escaped violence many times," explains. "Sometimes pure luck bus taxi happens come time someone chasing ... All us, we're uncertain authorities telling us. That's indignation. If [the authorities] aren't interested helping, we'll pressure them." Because group required law cooperate police, view suspicion. Yet success activist groups failed. It Banda Civil members made crucial discovery Claudia lvette Gonzalez's overalls February, humiliating Attorney General Rascon breathing new life investigation. And Banda Civil continued find evidence weekly searches Juarez's human dumping grounds. Besides role search-and-rescue/quasi-vigilante group, Banda Civil feel support group, providing members outlet daily fear comes life Juarez. According Guerra, 300 people accompanied group searches many family members missing women. And indeed, searches family activity. On one recent Saturday, search joined 60 participants ages sectors Juarez society, including middle manager Lear Corp. There terrible discoveries day, yet afterward, people stood around talked listened norteno music blaring car stereo, evident deeply murders ingrained life -- people fighting back whatever tools hand. Perhaps quiet optimism derived age-old Mexican axiom death brings rebirth. "Instead spending time criticizing authorities, we're trying find solutions," says Santos. "We sisters daughters feel same. My daughter danger. I can't let live like this." -- By Max Blumenthal [3( Copyright © 2010 Salon Media Group, Inc. Reproduction material Salon pages without written permission strictly prohibited.

sbwhoeop Friday, April 23, 2010 10:11 AM FYI Kornblum... Sid In light Clegg's rising popularity partly based anti-Americanism Germany's growing hegemony Europe becoming insular, John Kornblum written op-ed reference last graphs US policy. 7.71 April 23, 2010 I.H.T. Op-Ed Contributor Germany Need Dream By JOHN KORNBLUM Has Germany abandoned Europe? Do Angela Merkel's tough conditions aid Greece mean Germany longer motor European integration? Has Frau Merkel fact morphed Miss Europa 2007 Fraulein Germania 2010, Germany's former foreign minister Joschka Fischer suggested? As former American ambassador lived arid worked better part four decades around Germany, Blackberry often glows red hot messages persons asking questions. My response always same: Germany changed little, Europe world changed lot. Therein lies dilemma. Germany worked hard dig way disaster 1945, trauma remains defining issue German society. Sixty five years later, Germany still focused three essentials recovery: stability, respectability peace. Keep triangle mind lots things quickly come focus. From first days Federal Republic. Germany's leaders emphasized importance defining interests solely within common European Atlantic vocation. But also understood renouncing national ambitions remove responsibility pursue specific German goals common institutions. Many important postwar accomplishments conceived pushed Germany, sometimes opposition others — including United States. Ostpolitik controversial years, NATO enlargement. Germany pushed determination. Helmut Kohl consult promulgating 10 points reunification. He agreed French desires common currency, could mirror Deutsche mark, decades European monetary standard. The euro stability pact, object much controversy Greece, result. After 1990, E.U.'s eastward expansion Germany's way firming Eastern flank. Slowly without fanfare, Germany remaking European Union image. At step way, Germany made wishes palatable paying share. Part today's misunderstanding caused Germany's success using contributions build image selflessness. Germany single-minded pursuit goals Charles de Gaulle ever his, almost always left leadership others. A new consciousness grew costs reunification began mount. "Europe" institutional sense become increasingly unpopular. German courts begun define German European issues context German Constitution rather basis E.U. law. At least Ms. Merkel's refusal allow immediate assistance Greece based fears would fan anti-E.U. sentiment home. Are first signs German Tea Party? Here find source hand wringing Germany's role "motor Europe." Ms. Merkel's unwillingness sweeten financial pot echoed throughout Brussels. To many, signified decline German willingness "salute French flag three times raising German flag," Konrad Adenauer used put it. Germans alone objecting throwing money E.U. pot, happen ones something it. Many fear without German complaisance, E.U. stutter stop. But self- denial could never offer viable foundation new Europe. Neither could inefficiency even corruption characterizes many E.U. programs. Most maddening thinking Europeans knowledge Germans right. But them, question whether Germany remaking E.U. fashion palatable majority member states. They sure focus stability accountability right way help diverse collection peoples adjust globalized world. And Angela Merkel raps Greek knuckles, sending message Europeans don't want hear. Not Germany dangerous; even worse, unrelenting. The Neue aricher Zeitung probably spoke many others accused Germany wanting Europe become large Switzerland. The growing gap Germany's aspirations perceived needs members E.U. beginning burden sides. Most Europeans simply ready live German standards. Without flexible sense common purpose, project build democratic Europe could stop dead water. But Germans often tell you: They forgotten dream. Younger Germans feel lack inspiration well. Dreams 200,000 waiting hear rallied hear Barack Obama Berlin two summers ago. They wanted "Dare Hope," characteristically timid German translation title president's best seller. And still waiting. America seems busy elsewhere. The main conclusion I draw debate Germany Germany all. The task building democratic Europe far complete. Most foundations laid residents starting haggle design. Weaving today's 27 states true trans-Atlantic partnership task big Germany even Europe accomplish alone. They desperately need skilled architectural assistance. Uniting Europe North America audacious project ever conceived. If works, United States joined nearly 500 million Europeans form democratic space, within modern democratic values harness energy single nation earth. Democracy's future operating system globalized world assured. European fecklessness seems worry Washington officials days. But Germany forgotten dream United States busy try, guilty perpetuating aimlessness criticize. To hold side bargain, Europe needs exactly Barack Obama originally promised — audacity hope. John Kornblum, senior counselor international law firm Noerr LLP Berlin, served U.S. ambassador Germany 1997 2001.

Sid From Gary Sick Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi senior adviser President Ahmadinejad devoted proponent Divine Right Kings doctrine ultra-conservative ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi. Many regard eminence grise Iranian regime important bridge Revolutionary Guards, fanatic-fringe ayatollahs, presidency. So words worth listening clues happening inside closed circles Iranian leadership. Today quoted Fars news agency (in Persian) troublesome issue U.S.-Iran relations. Although statement translated English, needs word-for-word translation order understood. So I added interpretation Mojtaba really meant say. "Obama manage realize slogan [of change], pursued dark policies Bush world ever energetically..." [real meaning: Oh, miss George Bush! He easy target. With winning everywhere America's credibility falling point disappearance even among friends.] "The Bush presidency one darkest eras United States greatest hatred emerged internationally towards United States..." [Why can't Obama like Bush? In good old days didn't keep answering questions would accept outstretched hand friendship. It much easier then.] "Today see United States rather moving military forces Iraq Afghanistan increased number led mass murder people increased impoverishment countries. Obama said wanted oppose violation human rights wanted close Guantanamo secret prisons Europe. Did happen? Of course not..." [The United States announced withdrawal Iraq actually seems schedule; meantime, favorite parties politicians Iraq done well Iraqi elections despite support. The Shi'i religious leaders Najaf openly dismiss idea Islamic Republic increasingly competing us, instead following lead. In Afghanistan, Americans seem serious announcing date certain withdrawal, even seem edging Karzai reconciliation strategy Taliban. How attack straight face behave way!] "There also correction dark policy Bush towards Iran's nuclear program [the United State's] opposition towards Iranian nation..." [Their willingness meet us dastardly offer uranium swap hugely embarrassing. Now every time sit foreign leader listen tiresome suggestions reconsider position uranium swap — even Russians Chinese. You can't trust anyone days!] "We want anything United States. The Iranian nation demands rights recognized respected..." [All want Americans return George Bush! Even John McCain would improvement. I wonder Sarah Palin chance? We'll keep fingers crossed.] "The Islamic Republic become isolated, rather, expanding [its foreign relations] ever finding new friends... claims, must show actions Iranian nation gradually trusts them..."

sbwhoeop Thursday, March 25, 2010 10:16 AM H: Haaretz chief columnist Bibi's visit. Sid htto://www. haaretz.com/hasers/spagesil 158992. html Aluf Benn / Netanyahu leaves U.S. disgraced, isolated weaker By Ake Berm Details emerging Benjamin Netanyahu's visit Washington remain incomplete, conclusion may nonetheless drawn prime minister erred choosing fly United States week. The visit - touted fence- mending effort, bid strengthen tenuous ties Netanyahu U.S. President Barack Obama - highlighted deep rift American Israeli administrations. The prime minister leaves America disgraced, isolated, altogether weaker came. Instead setting diplomatic agenda, Netanyahu surrendered control it. Instead leaving Palestinian issue aside focusing Iran, would like, Netanyahu finds fighting legitimacy Israeli control East Jerusalem. Advertisement The sensitive insoluble core issues - raised decade ago led dissolution peace process explosion second intifada - served mere appetizer. At start visit, Netanyahu tempted bask warm welcome received AIPAC conference, gave emotional address Jerusalem. Taking page Menachem Begin, spoke behalf State Israel, name Jewish people millennia history. His speech radical rightist rhetoric. Reading lines, one could spot certain willingness relinquish West Bank settlements long Israel maintains security buffer Jordan Valley. But White House, prime minister's speech thousands pro-Israel activists hundreds cheering congressmen looked like obvious attempt raise political capital American president. Knowing Netanyahu would reenergized speech lobby, Obama staff set honey trap. Over weekend sought quell row flared U.S. Vice President Joe Biden's trip two weeks ago, U.S. Secretary State Hillary Clinton described Netanyahu's response ultimatums Washington presented "useful." Special envoy George Mitchell made televised visit prime minister's bureau Sunday invite Netanyahu White House. Washington, seemed, trying make nice. Far it. Just Netanyahu thought resolved crisis apologizing Biden, Clinton called dressing down. This time well, Netanyahu almost believed crisis passed, survived offering partial. noncommittal answers Americans' questions. Shortly meeting Obama, Netanyahu even warned Palestinians continue demand freeze construction, would postpone peace talks year. His arrogant tone underscored fact Netanyahu believed strength AIPAC speech, could call next steps diplomatic dance. But calamity struck. At White House meeting, Obama made clear guest letter Netanyahu sent insufficient returned corrections. Instead reception guest honor, Netanyahu treated problem child, army private ordered laps around base slipping roll call. The revolution Americans' behavior clear all. On Sunday morning Obama still anxiously looking ahead House Representatives vote health care - last thing wanted last-minute disagreement congressmen ties Israel. The moment bill passed, however, victorious Obama free deal unruly guest. The Americans made every effort downplay visit. As last visit November, Netanyahu invited White House late hour, without media coverage press conference. If enough, White House spokesman challenged Netanyahu's observation AIPAC "Jerusalem settlement." The Americans didn't even wait leave Washington make disagreement known. It behavior Washington shows ally, kind shows annoyance. The approval construction Shepherd Hotel Sheikh Jarrah, announced meeting Obama, caught Netanyahu unawares. Apparently special panel appointed Ramat Shlomo debacle prevent surprises failed first test. Netanyahu difficult week since returning office, beginning unfortunate decision relocate planned emergency room Ashkelon's Barzilai Medical Center lasting humiliating jaunt Washington. Returning Israel today, Netanyahu need work hard rehabilitate image, knowing full well Obama relent, instead demand stop zigzagging decide, all, whether stands America settlers.

Jerry, may recall, Guiliani's homeland security guy NYC became B6 one world's experts. He also worked Clinton Admn helped disaster relief (including earthquakes) around world. He called today suggestions (some may moot), I asked put memo. Here is, it's worth: I think fundamental issue one seems charge one person tasked trying pull pieces together short term long term plan. Obviously short term, search rescue food water main priorities. There seems little communication various areas people congregated central command post agencies call radio additional supplies including food, water medical. I don't recommend DoD put charge this. They rarely kind touch brings together necessary agencies one roof. I would set central command representatives federal agencies one place. There reason things disorganized. I would break island grids assign one person coordinator grids. That person responsible activities within grid report activities island on-scene coordinator. We get radio company like Motorola set temporary towers give State Department several hundred radios everyone involved response able communicate command post other. I think one important roles DoD provide security rescue teams medical teams. They also responsible operation airport, loading planes scheduling incoming flights lost time waiting planes land. I also think DoD responsible airlifting supplies requested one grid coordinators. Additionally, helicopters used move critical patients hospital ship way aircraft carrier currently station. At least day, coordinator assigned President Secretary State responsible getting situation reports agencies site, particularly regarding food water, security, medical search rescue. The lack command control allowing situation become chaotic rather coordinated. I believe Secretary talk nations involved UN, would supportive better coordination. Bottom line order operation need strong people speak behalf President Secretary get things control quickly. I hope helpful. If Secretary questions please feel free call cell We leave Tokyo 7:15 tomorrow transfer United flight due back DC 2:30 pm tomorrow. Please give Secretary best regards. I hope see soon. B6

Sid http://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/03/14/the_petraeus_briefing_biden_s_embarrassment_is_not_the_whole_sto ry The Petraeus briefing: Biden's embarrassment whole story Posted By Mark Perry 4Saturday, March 13, 2010 - On Jan. 16, two days killer earthquake hit Haiti, team senior military officers U.S. Central Command (responsible overseeing American security interests Middle East), arrived Pentagon brief Joint Chiefs Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The team dispatched CENTCOM commander Gen. David Petraeus underline growing worries lack progress resolving issue. The 33- slide, 45-minute PowerPoint briefing stunned Mullen. The briefers reported growing perception among Arab leaders U.S. incapable standing Israel, CENTCOM's mostly Arab constituency losing faith American promises, Israeli intransigence Israeli-Palestinian conflict jeopardizing U.S. standing region, Mitchell (as senior Pentagon officer later bluntly described it) "too old, slow ... late." The January Mullen briefing unprecedented. No previous CENTCOM commander ever expressed essentially political issue; briefers careful tell Mullen conclusions followed December 2009 tour region where, Petraeus's instructions, spoke senior Arab leaders. "Everywhere went, message pretty humbling," Pentagon officer familiar briefing says. "America viewed weak, military posture region eroding." But Petraeus wasn't finished: two days Mullen briefing, Petraeus sent paper White House requesting West Bank Gaza (which, Israel, part European Command -- EUCOM), made part area operations. Petraeus's reason straightforward: U.S. troops deployed Iraq Afghanistan, U.S. military perceived Arab leaders engaged region's troublesome conflict. [UPDATE: A senior military officer denied Sunday Petraeus sent paper White House. "CENTCOM team brief CJCS concerns revolving around Palestinian issue, CENTCOM propose UCP change, CJCS, WH," officer said via email. "GEN Petraeus certain might conveyed WH (if anything) brief CJCS." (UCP means "unified combatant command," like CENTCOM; CJCS refers Mullen; WH White House.)] The Mullen briefing Petraeus's request hit White House like bombshell. While Petraeus's request CENTCOM expanded include Palestinians denied ("it dead arrival," Pentagon officer confirms), Obama administration decided would redouble efforts -- pressing Israel settlements issue, sending Mitchell visit number Arab capitals dispatching Mullen carefully arranged meeting chief Israeli General Staff, Lt. General Gabi Ashkenazi. While American press speculated Mullen's trip focused Iran, JCS Chairman actually carried blunt, tough, message Israeli-Palestinian conflict: Israel see conflict Palestinians "in larger, regional, context" -- direct impact America's status region. Certainly, thought, Israel would get message. Israel didn't. When Vice President Joe Biden embarrassed Israeli announcement Netanyahu government building 1,600 new homes East Jerusalem, administration reacted. But one outraged Biden who, according Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth, engaged private, angry, exchange Israeli Prime Minister. Not surprisingly, Biden told Netanyahu reflected importance administration attached Petraeus's Mullen briefing: "This starting get dangerous us," Biden reportedly told Netanyahu. "What you're undermines security troops fighting Iraq, Afghanistan Pakistan. That endangers us endangers regional peace." Yedioth Ahronoth went report: "The vice president told Israeli hosts since many people Muslim world perceived connection Israel's actions US policy, decision construction undermines Palestinian rights East Jerusalem could impact personal safety American troops fighting Islamic terrorism." The message couldn't plainer: Israel's intransigence could cost American lives. There important powerful lobbies America: NRA, American Medical Association, lawyers -- Israeli lobby. But lobby important, powerful, U.S. military. While commentators pundits might reflect Joe Biden's trip Israel forever shifted America's relationship erstwhile ally region, real break came January, David Petraeus sent briefing team Pentagon stark warning: America's relationship Israel important, important lives America's soldiers. Maybe Israel gets message now. Mark Perry's newest book Talking To Terrorists http://warincontext.org/2olo/o3/14/israel-is-putting-american-liyes-at-risk/ My piece briefing Admiral Mullen CENTCOM senior officers occasioned great deal comment, well skepticism: accurate account? Was told direct participants briefing? Is basis imagining Petraeus kind hidden agenda, whether desire expand CENTCOM — even hostility towards Israel. I won't name sources, even though it's clear people Pentagon — certainly General Petraeus — are. Was I told briefing briefers themselves? I say four people briefing — two briefers, Admiral Mullen, Admiral Mullen's primary adviser Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I know two people involved briefing. Whether sources something reader determine. The account accurate, it's precis actually happened. There lot it. The White House, State Department Pentagon denied account, good reason: it's true. Is basis imagining Petraeus kind hidden agenda ordering briefing? I reporting American military thirty years. My work Joint Chiefs Staff, Four Stars, authoritative account subject. I deeply rooted contacts military go back thirty years. I never met senior military officer I admire. There greater insult believe General Petraeus senior American military officer would use lives American soldiers lever enhance political future. My sense General Petraeus neither likes dislikes Israel: loves country wants protect soldiers. The current crisis American relations Israel litmus test General Petraeus's loyalty Israel, his, our, concern Americans uniform Middle East. It is, perhaps, sign depth "the Biden crisis" every controversy type seems get translated whether America leaders committed Israel's security. This isn't Israel's security, it's security. http://maxblumenthal.com/2010/03/pastor-hagee-and- netanyahus-lovefest-on-eve-of-bidens-arrival-in-israel/ Netanyahu Pastor Hagee's Lovefest Eve Biden's Arrival Israel On 03.09.10, By Max (Videos recorded Rachel Tabachnick; videos coming shortly.)

When Nixon wanted foreign policy advice, everyone knew got from: Henry 'Kissinger, variously national security adviser secretary state. In contrast, Mr Obama big foreign policy strategist. Even insiders give different answers asked turns advice big international questions. But almost agree following observation. "The truth President Obama Henry Kissinger — one else plays role," says senior official. "Every administration reflects personality president. This president wants trains Barack Obama Great Wall China last year. Unlike predecessor Richard Nixon, turned Henry Kissinger advice, US president big foreign policy strategist routed Oval Office." Fifteen months took office, character structure Mr Obama's foreign policy machinery still evolving. But interviews dozens insiders outsiders, including senior officials authorised unauthorised speak, three former national security advisers, clear buck stops with, often floats quite long time around, Mr Obama himself. Foreigners complained tendency domestic agenda crowd international one — passage last week healthcare reform greeted audible sigh relief among US allies. But within foreign policy itself, centralised structure also result many issues left back burner awaiting presidential attention, say critics. "On positive side, conscientious president takes advice widely," says official. "On debit side, president's intelligence, Barack Obama came office little experience. He doesn't much depth issues.' The core Mr Obama's foreign policy machinery White House-based National Security Council, advises president co-ordinates activities across increasingly complex alphabet soup Washington departments, military commands intelligence agencies. The widely questioned link chain Jim Jones, whom, many people's surprise, Mr Obama brought national security adviser. Only briefly acquainted Mr Obama beforehand, General Jones, retired four-star marine corps general, shows little interest running "inter-agency" process — key part job. Somewhat unconventionally, Gen Jones travels frequently thus often town. Unusually, Mr Obama usually chairs weekly National Security Council, known "principals meeting", Gen Jones. Rahm Emanuel, Mr Obama's chief staff, also key part it. "If ask real national security adviser is, I would say three four, Rehm one Gen Jones probably least important," says another official. Anyone dealt Gen Jones speaks highly matter-of-factness, geniality respect many foreign governments — Pakistan Israel among them. But admitted rather disarmingly last year, taste bureaucracy. Speaking Atlantic Council, think-tank previously worked, Gen Jones provoked laughter said: "I fondly remember [the Atlantic Council] place people actually asked do. In new role I'm finding order basis negotiation." The lack strong national security adviser created recurring difficulties. Perhaps best example Arab- Israeli peace process, Mr Obama launched second day office appointed Geproe Mitphspil envoy. Three months later, Mr Obama insisted Benjamin Netanyahu freeze settlements activity order boost Arab confidence talks. In heated ;34.16NA(dpyin ,Clvg li..0f7;ce. last May, Mr Netanyahu refused accede Mr Obama's demand, officials present Mr Emanuel David Axelrod, senior adviser Mr Obama office campaign. Gen Jones there. The fallout put talks abeyance damped high Arab hopes Mr Obama. "The question is, bright spark advised president demand settlements freeze without working next step Netanyahu inevitably said 'No'?" says Leslie Gelb, official Carter administration former head Council Foreign Relations. "Why wasn't George Mitchell room? Where Jones?" Mr Obama's character also stamped inter-agency process, set managed Tom Donilon, deputy national security adviser. The nitty-gritty foreign policy-making done frequent "deputies' meetings", sometimes consume four six hours day. Described one insider "the powerful man White House whose name isn't widely known", Mr Donilon, official Clinton administration, man keeps Mr Obama's trains running time. And lot trains. Last year, Mr Donilon held 270 deputies meetings — workload described "clinically insane" former senior diplomat Bill Clinton. But time goes on, becoming streamlined — taking roughly two three hours day, say officials. "People forget inherited two wars, terrorism threats, perhaps biggest single eight-year decline [George W. Bush's two terms] America's power reputation history," says senior official. "It took time put place process could deal complex decisions take." Also organiser Mr Obama's 9.30arn national security briefing, Mr Donilon reinstated paper trails needed prevent intra-governmental anarchy, using model devised Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser George Bush senior Gerald Ford. Vice-president Joe Biden's team also incorporated prevent kind "parallel process" Dick Cheney used circumvent bureaucracy George W. Bush. "If look 2002 2003 meeting decision go war iraq taken, cannot find it," says senior official. "By getting process right, improving quality decisions." The deputies' ties go back years. For example, families Mr Don;Ion Jim Steinberg, deputy secretary state, often go holiday together. Mr Donilon's wife, Cathy Russell, chief staff Jill Biden, vice-president's wife. Mr Steinberg's wife, Sherburne Abbott, deputy John Holdren, Mr Obama's chief scientific adviser. All regularly attend, including Michele Flournoy, senior Pentagon official, Susan Rice, US ambassador United Nations, known since least 1993, started Clinton administration. This well, since spend half lives together: "A lot work gets done group," says Ms Flournoy. "Sometimes feels like shovelling coal keep fires going." The refurbished machinery perhaps evidence build-up Mr Obama's decision December send another 30,000 US troops Afghanistan — journey took four months involved 40 hours Oval Office meetings. But diligence process crowded Mr Obama's time focus crises — many. "Time precious commodity president has," says former national security adviser. "On average going 45 minutes day foreign policy, want make sure well spent." The widely expected departure Gen Jones end year also created rivalries within engine room. Those thought ambitions replace include Mr Steinberg, Ms Rice, Mr Donilon Denis McDonough, NSC chief staff foreign policy official personally closest Mr Obama. Although widely respected, none considered big strategic thinker Kissinger Scowcroft mould. Described Mr Gelb Mr Obama's "Lord High Executioner", Mr McDonough "has appended Chicago crowd", says another official. Mr McDonough's widely feared role highlights contradictions Mr Obama's foreign policy apparatus. Once adviser former Senate majority leader Tom Deschle, Mr McDonough frequently Mr Obama's side campaign. Insiders describe "enforcer" keeper "message discipline", key element campaign something drastically slow wheels government. "McDonough guy campaign one plays basketball president — they're close," says official. "Instead Jim Jones telling McDonough president thinks, way round." Indeed, Mr Obama's highly centralised foreign policy machine face, would Mr McDonough's. "Donilon perceived make process inclusive give everyone seat table," says David Rothkopf, former Clinton official scholar NSC. "Fairly not, McDonough perceived representing process taking place another room, among inner circle, table weren't invited." Mr Obama built machine roads lead him. On minus side, means lot lower-level meetings without decisions. It also means neglecting issues cannot squeezed diary, trade policy, continues drift; relations India, unnecessarily tense. And means fingerprints Mr Obama's political inner circle detected rumour mill even absent, president's decision begin rog,,g: witsirawal anistan. July 2011 — recommendation came Robert Gates, secretary defence. On plus side. Mr Obama sharp learning curve, means administration continues evolve. On plus side also, White House-centric, perhaps better Sun King than, say, Nixon George W. Bush. "At end meeting, president summarises everyone said arguments made real lawyer's clarity," says participant NSC principals meeting, includes Mr Gates Mrs Clinton. "When president finally makes decision, full facts usually shows high calibre judgment." When Mr Obama makes decision, is. STATE AND DEFENCE DEPARTMENTS An 'alliance unsackables' finds confront inner circle If caveat depiction Obama administration White House-centric, alliance Hillary Clinton Robert Gates, president's secretaries state defence. Mrs Clinton proved one surprises Barack Obama's tenure, forging strong working relationship former rival establishing chief foreign policy spokesperson internationally — home, Mr Obama's inner circle often seems monopolise explaining. Mr Gates, recently decided stay least another year, seen unsackable, least credibility lends issues ranging missile defence Guantanamo Bay Afghanistan. As holdover Bush administration, national security bona fides hard dispute. It coincidence Mrs Clinton probably unsackable cabinet member. The combination made felt administration's significant debates, notably Afghanistan, successfully urged deployment troops. "Gates Clinton happen like other, one really predicted," says one official, notes traditional role NSC "play referee" state defence departments, often nowadays combination two White House. This different worked Donald Rumsfeld Colin Powell held positions. "We work together well," Mr Gates said appearance Mrs Clinton CNN last year. "I think starts with, frankly, based experience, secretary defence willing acknowledge secretary state principal spokesperson United States foreign policy." Their outlooks often overlap. From Pentagon, Mr Gates long called US spending diplomacy. As chief diplomat, Mrs Clinton adopted muscular approach. On Iran, favour tough sanctions; Russia, sought reassure Moscow's neighbours even improving relations Kremlin. But workmanlike co-operation, escaping fact Mrs Clinton part Obama inner circle — traditionally helpful feature job. There also constant "residue friction" Mr Obama's Mrs Clinton's teams, according insiders. For example, Cheryl Mills, Mrs Clinton's chief staff, several run-ins others administration. One official describes Mrs Clinton "totally loyal" Mr Obama. He adds: "She president best friends — could be? But totally respects presidency — married president wanted one ... She still might be."

After Afghan Shift, Top U.S. Civilians Face Tricky Future By MARK LANDLER WASHINGTON — As General David H. Petraeus takes command Afghanistan, two top American civilian officials war face uncertain tricky future, working newly empowered military leader, gaze impatient president put notice fractious war council needs pull together.Richard C. Holbrooke, Obama administration's special representative region, Karl W. Eikenberry, ambassador Afghanistan, hung jobs uproar followed Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal's career-ending quotes Rolling Stone magazine.But privately, least one senior White House official suggested using General McChrystal's exit excuse housecleaning, according senior officials. That rejected disruptive military campaign relies heavily civilian support, people said.ln recent days, administration officials begun floating idea Ambassador Eikenberry might replaced Ryan C. Crocker, highly regarded former ambassador Iraq forged close partnership General Petraeus successful Iraq troop increase. Such prospect viewed remote, given Mr. Crocker's prestigious new post Texas A&M University. But fact name invoked underlines challenges confront Ambassador Eikenberry, adapts new partner — one strong ideas soldiers diplomats work together war. It also illustrates remarkably powerful role General Petraeus assume nine-year-old war, setting almost viceroy Afghanistan key broker negotiations President Hamid Karzai Pakistan eventual political settlement.Before General Petraeus's arrival, critics said White House created problem recruiting several forceful, ambitious personalities giving jobs overlapping responsibilities. Administration officials acknowledge that, one said, "there obviously number substantial personalities team." But White House believes current lineup mesh, difficult war demands much talent. Still, McChrystal blow-up reverberated State Department. Secretary State Hillary Rodham Clinton instructed Ambassador Eikenberry Mr. Holbrooke take hard look civilian team, two officials said. She wedded current lineup continues bog internecine battles, said."You can't major shift civ-mil structure without civilian side take step back look everything," said senior State Department official, using jargon civilian-military campaign.General Petraeus, whose appointment approved 99-0 Senate Wednesday, took pains confirmation hearing Tuesday back unified civilian military effort. He noted telephoned Mr. Holbrooke would rendezvous Ambassador Eikenberry Brussels, two could land Kabul together."Holbrooke wingman, great degree," General Petraeus said interview. "We had, have, good relationship." That role, said, fall Ambassador Eikenberry.Ambassador Eikenberry highly critical Pentagon's proposal last year send 60,000 additional troops Afghanistan, led difficult relationship General McChrystal. But fact General Petraeus true architect plan.The ambassador, retired lieutenant general former commander Afghanistan, graduated West Point 1973, year ahead General Petraeus, know academy. The two share scholarly bent: General Petraeus holds Ph.D. Princeton, Ambassador Eikenberry master's degrees Harvard Stanford.While never assigned together, careers intersected twice. In Iraq, General Eikenberry led assessment Iraqi security forces General Petraeus commanding 101st Airborne Division Mosul. When General Eikenberry commander Afghanistan, General Petraeus led assessment Afghan National Security Forces.General Petraeus declined discuss personnel issues, Ambassador Eikenberry Mr. Holbrooke turned requests interview. Mr. Crocker, dean George Bush School Government Texas A&M, return call comment. For Mr. Holbrooke, new landscape challenging ways. Officials said job security less doubt six months ago, ouster subject Washington chatter. Yet arguably become less central player: Jacob J. Lew, deputy secretary state, manages much civilian influx Afghanistan Mr. Holbrooke helped shape, embassy Kabul carrying out. Mr. Holbrooke's current portfolio played weaknesses, allies admit. He best high-level negotiator, comfortable nitty-gritty work helping Afghanistan build economy.These days, Mr. Holbrooke become globe-trotting diplomat, trying retain flagging European allies seeking draw influential Muslim countries like Egypt helping Afghanistan. At recent conference 35 countries Madrid, Mr. Holbrooke drummed support allies Afghan government's campaign reintegrate Taliban fighters mainstream society.Mr. Karzai's longer-term effort reconcile Taliban leaders, negotiations Pakistan, could propel Mr. Holbrooke back central role. Were talks become serious, several officials said, Mr. Holbrooke's negotiating skills could put use, broker guardian American interests. For now, though, evidence General Petraeus's influence, shuttling Kabul Islamabad, Pakistani capital.On last visit region, Mr. Holbrooke met Mr. Karzai senior Pakistani officials, including army chief staff, Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. Mr. Holbrooke's past run-ins Mr. Karzai, several officials said, hindered ability deal Afghan leader, Pakistani officials said trusted him.

Greetings Nairobi. I'm end week-long trip Kampala, Kinshasa Nairobi. The trip productive I fill discussions I I return. In meantime, I know number discussions Dan Benjamin others relating new aggressive approach CVE I wanted update thoughts terms critical discussions fit overall approach strategic communications around globe. As I discussed, essential become much pro-active communications efforts. To put bluntly, "information war" fronts. With proliferation media outlets opportunities around world, must fight aggressively get, maintain, fair share "consumer share mind." Both adversaries allies recognize importance aspect foreign policy adopting new ways communicating foreign publics. Consumers everywhere constantly facing barrage information cases misinformation dis-information. In order get messages across confront threats posed adversaries, must develop new sense urgency communications efforts. Much said written concept "soldier diplomats". In vein, I believe must empower corps "diplomat soldiers" help us gain ground new war. While countering violent extremism is, remain, key objective communications efforts must apply level determination respect communications. We must aggressively promote positive stories US rapidly respond attacks us. In past, failure respond attacks distortions diminished credibility undermined ability combat adversaries. For example, responded rumors innuendos surrounding relief efforts Haiti, I believe would provided fertile field AQ others continue perpetuate image US "invader". Before I left trip, I convened meeting top PD officers told must become much aggressive strategic communications programs initiatives. We plan implement daily calls new regional PD DAS's PAO's regions monitor daily basis stories USG. We work Posts ensure strategies dealing stories develop. I would also like request send cable Chiefs Mission informing new strategy reminding responsibilities critical area. We work draft review return.

Sid http://jamesfallows.theatiantic.comiarchives/2010/01/a_momentous_40_hours.php#more Xr 07: Hi!!ary Clinton's "Internet freedom speech iVian A momentous 40 hours, leading Clinton/China/Internet 21 Jan 2010 04:12 pm Apart two obvious pieces momentous news past day-and-a-half -- new junior Senator Massachusetts, new ckv V. V5- rvi,- , , c.:! (by I mean today's lamentable, straight-party-line Supreme Court ruline ;that removes limits direct corporate underwriting political campaigns) -- one event today big ripple effects. mean SecState Hillary Clinton's speech morning "Internet Freedom," mentioned ;:lere prelude discussion I'm going take time thorough gloss speech. Instead I highly recommend reading full text, lette, watching official video, .'tere. And main points listening (and noting main points real time handy ' uiveaSccibe, pen.) - In contrast dreamy Internet optimism decade ago -- I'm naming names, I remember! -- many people imagined info technology, itself, would undermine oppression bring world together, Clinton started astringent reminder technology, like others, neither good bad already used helpful destructive ways: "Amid unprecedented surge connectivity, must also recognize technologies unmitigated blessing. These tools also exploited undermine human progress political rights. Just steel used build hospitals machine guns, nuclear power either energize city destroy it, modern information networks technologies support harnessed good ill. The networks help organize movements freedom also enable al-Qaida spew hatred incite violence innocent. And technologies potential open access government promote transparency also hijacked governments crush dissent deny human rights." And nice pivot section, effective it's blunt plain: "On own, new technologies take sides struggle freedom progress, United States does." - Underscoring "this big deal" tone speech, enumerated "Four Freedoms" FDR proclaimed 1941, part struggle world's future, said comparable set Four Freedoms Internet age. Check speech details. - The China surprise: speech frontal challenge Chinese internet overall censorship policy I expected, I recall US-China interactions long time. For instance, early speech, itemization places suppression getting worse: "In last year, we've seen spike threats free flow information. China, Tunisia, Uzbekistan stepped censorship Internet. In Vietnam, access popular social networking sites suddenly disappeared. And last Friday Egypt, 30 bloggers activists detained." Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Egypt -- grouping countries Chinese government, recent sense rise superpower status, used lumped with. Compared US financial power, OK; overtaking japan economic size, yes; crucial player environmental negotiations.., one thing. Bracketed sentence Tunisia Uzbekistan different. Sentences like don't appear formal, big- deal SecState addresses accident. Other passages effect: "As I speak today, government censors somewhere working furiously erase words records history. But history already condemned tactics.... "Those disrupt free flow information society pose threat economy, government, civil society. Countries individuals engage cyber attacks face consequences international condemnation...." And Google section itself. I wondered whether speech would mention Google name -- reason think might not. (Main argument forleavina implicit rather referring directly Google case: company's ongoing efforts find "il lvineyiftaiv_in" acceptable way remain China, rather lose-lose-lose permanent split, necessarily help U.S. government standing officially side. ) But way Sec. Clinton introduced point significant: proxy China's ability H.to,tentiai sustain economic rise: "To use market terminology, publicly listed company Tunisia Vietnam operates environment censorship always trade discount relative identical firm free society. If corporate decision makers don't access global sources news information, investors less confidence decisions long term. Countries censor news information must recognize economic standpoint, distinction censoring political speech commercial speech. If businesses nations denied access either type information, inevitably impact growth. "Increasingly, U.S. companies making issue internet information freedom greater consideration business decisions. I hope competitors foreign governments pay close attention trend. The recent situation involving Google attracted great deal interest. And look Chinese authorities conduct thorough review cyber intrusions led Google make announcement. And also look investigation results transparent. "The Internet already source tremendous progress China, fabulous. There many people China online. But countries restrict free access information violate basic rights internet users risk walling progress next century. Now, United States China different views issue, intend address differences candidly consistently context positive, cooperative, comprehensive relationship." There's lot speech, including terrorism, disaster relief, religion, etc -- it's reading. Back to-do list now. Peirmalink .Share This

FYI: From one folks hired working Pierre Louis: Lessons Aceh Nias Multi-Donor Trust Fund 1. The Government Indonesia (G01) responded Tsunami issuing series government decrees, immediately organized overview relief efforts ensure rational coordinated response. The first task produce Damage Loss Assessment (DLA). The DLA followed detailed Master Plan Rehabilitation Reconstruction (MPRR). The MPRR provided in-depth sector plans, spatial planning, governance supervision arrangements finances considerable attention avoid minimize corruption. The process behind MPRR consultative, wide range local stakeholders public offices heard. The MPRR presented 26 March, 3 months Tsunami. 2. The MPRR form basis general three-stage strategy. The Relief phase originally set six months, reduced three: January- March 2005. The Rehabilitation phase run 21 months, December 2006, Reconstruction phase July 2006 December 2009. The MPRR provides well defined phasing interventions. 3. The objectives Relief efforts humanitarian relief: rescue; food medicine; emergency infrastructure temporary shelter; burying dead. The Rehabilitation phase restore services minimum level: public services; economic facilities; banking financial institutions; trauma treatments; secure land rights; law order; temporary shelter. Finally, Reconstruction rebuild region: rebuilding economy (production, trade banking); transportation, telecommunications, social cultural systems; improving institutional capacity; housing. 4. The Government set ministerial-level agency manage MPRR program Aceh itself, Rehabilitation Reconstruction Agency Aceh Nias. The BRR formally established end April 2005 became operational early May. The World Bank Board 30 March 2005 formally established Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDF) Steering Committee comprised BRR, GOI, donors civil society. Having credible local coordinators key success. 5. The EC channels nearly 93% funds MDF, 2.5% USD 400 million US goes MDF. While payments fund slow, disbursements begin even slower. By October 2005, project agreements USD 200 million signed, USD 3 million actually disbursed. Disbursements picked pace thereafter. The delay caused two principal impediments: first, donors quick pledge funds, getting exact written agreements place took time. This points need donors flexible regarding formal agreements, accept simple, generic paragraphs contribute speedy resolution slightly differing phrasings concerns. Second, processing time project approval implementation concern. Since MDF funded projects on-budget, implemented government institutions. This crated bottlenecks. 6. Smaller donors joined wished support reconstruction efforts Aceh capacity often strong views best pursue this. They want Bank assume fiduciary responsibilities funds high-risk environment, also take lead ensuring funds go prioritized activities. The MDF thus seen well-managed bank account paid- administrative services. However, all-inclusive Steering Committee made membership large extent unwieldy, forced discuss policy operational issues. 7. The Multi Donor Fund Secretariat developed Outreach Strategy includes regular radio talk shows, field visits meet discuss beneficiaries communication advertisements well telephone hotline. 8. MDF received praise engaging Government Indonesia (G01) policy dialogue. The MDF thus entry point engaging conditions sustainability, relevance impact. 9. Because MDF accept strict ear marking donor contributions — though allow preference indications — means funds freely available programming according criteria priorities MDF agrees to. Given strong GOI participation, MDF seen successful instrument harmonization coordination environment criticized lack coordination. The MDF's Mid Term Review conducted 2008-2009 found MDF made positive contribution harmonizing donor efforts increasing effectiveness efficiency reconstruction effort. 10. The MDF sufficiently engage private sector coherent job creation strategy. The MDF lacked executive rights, GOI BRR credited leveraging decisive response.

(Gary Fabiano / Sipa Press) Obama's bow Netanyahu latest series disastrous missteps U.S. policy toward Israel. Leslie H. Gelb who's blame—and White House get back course. Whoever advised President Obama flay Israel publicly week fired. Only advisers experience dealing Israel could believed Israeli leaders like Prime Minister Netanyahu would bow public attacks. And whoever advised Mr. Obama kneel rhetorically Mr. Netanyahu public Tuesday also fired. The thing accomplished embarrassing tactic put Israel position call shots Mideast policy rest Obama's first term. The real enemy negotiated settlement Mideast time; it's failure. Were culprits non-foreign policy White House intimates — chief staff Rahm Emanuel political honcho David Axelrod? Axelrod knows nothing this, worse, Emanuel thinks lived Israel. Was George Mitchell, president's Mideast negotiator, brains behind foolishness? Surely, he's enough experience working Israelis know better. Did General James Jones, National Security Adviser, remain silent, again? And course, Secretary State Hillary Clinton? Strangely someone adept pleasing Israel's constituents America, spent lot time past year publicly beating Israeli leaders. Has led astray pro- Arab contingent State Department? •Martin Indyk: New Hope Mideast Peace •Peter Beinart: Netanyahu's Latest Insult Or guilty party none President Obama himself? The find makes decisions White House every subject nuclear weapons coloring Easter eggs, turns man Oval Office himself. He's expert. He's decider. He invites everyone state piece peace, tells — seemingly without question, bidding. Mr. Obama started White House tenure near-zero base foreign policy knowledge experience Middle East. It easy enough guess blissful state earliest decisions. He came box demanding Israel agree suspend construction West Bank precondition direct negotiations Palestinians. Anyone knew anything situation surely would told president chances Mr. Netanyahu agreeing "proposal" zero, minus zero. No Israeli leader, even dovish one, would ever dream beginning negotiations conceding major bargaining card. As teenagers say, Obama advisers thinking? And yes, Israelis publicly humiliated Vice President Biden trip Holy Land announcing would start new construction East Jerusalem, Washington respond vehemently. The Israelis arrogant stupid one. They weakened American power region. No U.S. president could let get away it. Clinton others made strong public statements criticism, fine. But Mr. Obama allowed Mr. Netanyahu come ahead planned visit D.C. — publicly humiliated him. The U.S. president let Israeli prime minister cool heels hours meeting him, wouldn't shake hand departed. There's surer way unite nation behind leader, even controversial one like Netanyahu, foreign leader humiliate him. This brilliant tactic — thought Obama's advisers president — accomplished two things. It stiffened Israeli backs even conciliatory starting talks Palestinians. The Israeli government cave American pressures. It also galvanized Israeli supporters United States — particular within conservative parts Jewish community Republican Party. There went Mr. Obama's support pressing Israel even private. To top Tuesday's meeting, full smiles adoption Israeli-desired language almost every topic, made matters worse. It made situation look American president cowed Jewish control . . American politics. That certainly pleased American Israeli hawks, please others want see genuine progress Mideast talks. There time place Washington put pressure Israel. Mr. Obama team picked every wrong time place. The right occasion squeeze negotiations reached point sides given must give close deal. Only point pressure make sense. All parties would get real shot peace return concessions. To sure, many ask point — How get point? The answer browbeat parties scurry negotiating table. That tactic simply never pays off. The answer build conditions beyond negotiating table, conditions political community Israel Palestine, would support compromises table. The British' pushed Catholics Protestants make concessions year year, fail time again, inflame feelings around spur greater violence. Finally, London focused getting Protestant Catholic women form common groups support compromise. London much various business communities evolved backers mutual concessions well. Only parties know support compromises, negotiations got somewhere, reached agreement. That's needs done Israel Palestinians. We hear time enemy peace Middle East time, time running out. Perhaps caused Mr. Obama team misstep badly; think it's race clock. Do something fail. But real enemy negotiated settlement Mideast time; it's failure. Neither Israel Palestinians United States afford fail again. After yet another failure, could well result perpetual violence. To set Arab-Israeli policy sensible course, Mr. Obama needs search new advisors know get things done Middle East, hire them, listen them. Leslie H.

Here's summary: 1. 56% Americans agree claim humanitarian crisis Gaza; 2. 43% Americans agree claim people Gaza starving; 3. 34% Americans support Israeli operation Flotilla; 4. 20% Americans "felt support" Israel following announcement easing Gaza closure. Frank Luntz analyses Netanyahu's media performance flotilla affair The figures troubling worrisome. If situation great friend US, easy imagine situation other, somewhat less sympathetic countries. Channel Ten TV News, July 1 2010 20:38 Yaacov Eilon (host): Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu considered make extremely persuasive presentation world press. But professional analysis US expert presented yesterday senior aides strongly criticizes him. Netanyahu's messages flotilla caused harm good. Our political correspondent Chico Menashe obtained report. Chico Menashe: Criticism Prime Minister Netanyahu's current PR messages Israeli PR general comes international elite media consultants pollsters mouth Frank Luntz, considered one leading American political consultants, Republican pollster, consultant many governments throughout world dozens biggest corporations US. He asked Jewish organization The Israel Project check opinions American public messages Israel issued world flotilla events. The result harsh document primarily criticizes media strategy person considered Israel's number one propagandist world, Prime Minister Netanyahu. Netanyahu: Once Israel faces hypocrisy biased rush judgment. Chico Menashe: Every time Israeli speakers begin accusing international community, writes Luntz, lose audience. For example, Netanyahu's comments flotilla world hypocrisy rejected American participants listened them. The findings presented last night senior members Netanyahu's Bureau. Luntz checked opinions focus groups, poll. He warns dangerous slide public opinion country considered pro-Israeli, U.S. Israel misses simple opportunities change world public opinion, writes, consequences significant. The American public increasingly hesitates accept arguments support Israeli positions. Ehud Barak: There hunger Gaza humanitarian crisis. Netanyahu: There's shortage food, there's shortage medicine, there's shortage goods. Chico Menashe: Luntz says Israel must immediately stop using argument hunger humanitarian crisis Gaza. He says fatally destroys Israel's credibility light images television screens. Israel must admit problem, says, gain listeners' sympathy [emphasis mine]. Luntz finds troubling figure 56% participants agree claim humanitarian crisis Gaza, less astonishing 43% participants American public agree claim people Gaza starving. But even lifting closure supposed improve Israel's image missed opportunity, according Luntz. Netanyahu: Yesterday important decision made security cabinet. Its meaning clear. On one hand, allowing civilian goods Gaza, hand maintaining military blockade Hamas. Chico Menashe: The statement Netanyahu's bureau lifting closure missed opportunity gain support international public opinion [emphasis mine]. Only 20% Americans polled felt support Israel following statement. According Lunt, summary flotilla damage American public opinion: Only 34% American public support Israeli operation flotilla, says dangerously low percentage.

Gaza: it's Hamas's move Hamas must seize initiative ever end Israel's occupation Palestine • • c) Jeremy Greenstock o quardian.co.uk, Wednesday 2 June 2010 12.29 BST So happened again. Nearly 18 months Israelis bombed Gaza wasteland, barely load building materials allowed since then, Turkey taken brunt operation humanitarian assistance gone wrong. The UN must establish facts impartially independently and, laws broken, responsible must held account. Political demonstrations posing relief flotillas go wrong easily Israel understandably prevent weapons smuggled Gaza. But really best way bring ships shore examination? A commando attack civilian ships looks callous disproportionate. No one hurt, whatever emotions behind this. Why Gaza siege first place? Under international law, Israelis responsible occupying force proper administration territory; half point Israel law. Yet creating traumatised territory 1.5m neighbours, many whose children seem want grow suicide bombers. They also pouring fertiliser al-Qaida's ground. The director UNRWA operations Gaza, John Ging, gave speech London week entitled "Illegal, inhuman. insane: medieval siege Gaza 2010". This objective humanitarian practitioner listened to. How Israel, democracy region symbol need racially inspired violence end, come risk claim international legitimacy handling situation? Hamas enemy Israel, be. They preach violent resistance readily, yet past 17 months trying control militant groups intent threatening Israel rockets — imperfectly perhaps, single Israeli citizen killed (alas, one immigrant worker was) rocket since Gaza bombing stopped January 2009. They also implacable opponents al-Qaida. They won fair election 2006 claim respect democracy. Let's test that. At present, Hamas security people sniped Israeli Defence Forces try arrest militant groups. This genuinely getting insane. The unwisdom reliance angry military responses clearer mood Palestine, West Bank Gaza, steadily moving towards negotiated end occupation. I convinced direct experience Hamas prepared establish respect long-term ceasefire talking start without threat violence, would enter good faith, reciprocated, negotiations establish two states disputed territories, Israel Palestine, rights responsibilities international law. The distortion position, little fault PR, side good. If comprehensive negotiation much expect now, first step? I believe arrangement end blockade within reach Israel, Egypt Gaza would test possibilities dialogue. Hamas indicated could cease attacks Israeli soil, close tunnels, release Gilead Shalit stop import arms Gaza blockade ended, agreed number Palestinian prisoners released Gaza began rebuilt. The Palestinians course work internal reconciliation, relationship Fatah West Bank Hamas Gaza remains bad. But UN, US, Russia, EU Arab world must make much serious attempt test possibilities, putting ordinary Israelis Palestinians first, political comfort. We coming close losing chance two-state solution. US policy, based West-Bank-only approach, locked cul-de-sac Gaza left equation, majority Palestinian support lacking. Israel confident knowledge cannot militarily defeated. But ignores huge danger losing political, diplomatic, legal moral high ground. This matters today's world, US UK discovered Iraq, government authority public opinion interact closely, legitimacy breeds support. Israel's relationship Turkey key broader understanding Islamic community others beyond west. That lies tatters. If Israel left permanent occupier, controlling one-state structure part population downgraded imprisoned, truly disaster people stand for. I hope Hamas sit back enjoy Israel's discomfiture. They far, political organisation, attracted much narrow range international support. If wish widely accepted negotiating partner, must unequivocally accept fully justified condition set international Quartet — cessation violence — underline objective two-state settlement, win international friends ending occupation. In whoever's hands, bombs, bullets, rockets iron bars achieve nothing. But push justice will. •This article originally written Times published

Mills, Cheryl D <MillsCD©state.gov> Tuesday, June 22, 2010 8:14 AM FW: Rahm's long goodbye Rahm's long goodbye By: Glenn Thrush June 22, 2010 04:34 AM EDT For talk Rahm Emanuel reaching "eject" button, fiery White House chief staff isn't leaving immediate future — could serve well 2011, according people close him. "It's opinion top levels White House Rahm going longer many people think," said senior administration official, speaking condition anonymity. Speculation Emanuel's departure favorite parlor game nearly year — stoked Emanuel's admission he'd love run Chicago mayor (should current' Mayor Richard Daley retire, course), kvetching rigors job, withering attacks left right fact average expiration date chief staff 18 months. Emanuel leaving, departure date proved profoundly elastic. Friends co-workers said vacillates day day, sometimes minute minute. He might leave December midterms; might stay next summer, depending whether Daley runs President Barack Obama asks stick around, said. And even pines native Chicago, Emanuel continues put real roots D.C., recently writing check enroll children exclusive Maret School Washington 2011 school year, according person close Emanuel. He's shown signs loosening grip tiller — bombarding White House staffers long-distance calls first days Gulf oil spill even traveled Israel son's bar mitzvah. And broader sense, it's hard imagine Emanuel's huge personality extracted political, journalistic bar stool life Obama's Washington. Take last game last week's NBA Finals, American voter could wander Tunnicliff's Tavern Capitol Hill witness one powerful men nation egging Boston Celtics — screaming flat-screen TV, actually — joined merry band included Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.); Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.); Jim Manley, spokesman Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.); pair favorite reporters The New York Times The Washington Post. Despite British tabloid story asserting Emanuel sick Obama's "idealism" racing exit, former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman still loves attention power current job hasn't made mind he's leaving, people know said. "This BS. And need translation, baseless," Emanuel said statement pushing back story U.K.'s Daily Telegraph portraying Emanuel restless! fed up. Replacing Emanuel, eventually goes, easy task Obama small clique close advisers led Pete Rouse, David Axelrod Valerie Jarrett. For one thing, Obama company need know post-November political landscape looks like picking successor: If Republicans take back one house Congress, new chief staff need know leverage executive power hostile Hill; Democrats retain majorities, Emanuel's successor need legislative skills. Barring major course correction, Obama, prizes loyalty familiarity, isn't likely reach far outside inner circle, advisers said. Still, president increasingly cognizant reputation insularity would quite likely give serious look respected former Clinton chiefs staff Leon Panetta, currenW head CIA, John Podesta, runs Center American Progress, major liberal think tank close ties administration. Rouse, senior adviser served Obama's Senate chief staff, considered best pure manager White House logical choice replace Emanuel, according half-dozen.administration officials consultants. But Rouse's colleagues say quiet 60-year-old insider loves work, Grateful Dead cats — despises spotlight would likely turn job unless Obama insisted. "The key thing Pete president trusts would feel very, comfortable charge," said Democratic consultant knows men well. "But probably won't take it." One possible candidate — deputy chief staff Jim Messina, Emanuel's political go-to guy — likely play major role Obama's 2012 reelection campaign expected move Chicago sometime next year. In Messina's absence, another Emanuel favorite — Deputy National Security Adviser Tom Donilon — emerged possible successor, according people close situation. Obama impressed Donilon's presentations President's Daily Briefing, Rhode Island native wide variety political governmental experience, serving congressional liaison President Jimmy Carter, chief State Department spokesman President Bill Clinton campaign adviser helped Obama prepare debates John McCain. One major Donilon drawback: He served executive vice president Fannie Mae, bailed-out mortgage giant, reportedly lobbied stronger regulatory oversight. David Plouffe, Obama's 2008 campaign manager, another contender, reputation discipline, team building solid management skills. But Plouffe reluctant settle Washington, earning stellar living consultant hates press. Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle also possible successor, even though nomination Health Human Services secretary scuttled revelations failed report limo rides paid corporate client. Another White House aide, Phil Schiliro, favorite Obama's legislative savvy political instincts. But critics said lacks range policy political experience candidates possess, mastery Hill won't mean much Democrats surrender majorities either house. Then there's Ron Klain, 49, Vice President Joe Biden's brainy politically astute chief staff, said intensely interested making move Eisenhower Executive Office Building West Wing. Klain — also served Al Gore's chief staff — well-regarded inside White House. Plus, he's got touch star power: Kevin Spacey played HBO movie "Recount," role guiding Gore campaign 2000 Florida recount. Klain's downside: He's essentially outsider yet develop serious rapport president, according insiders. C 2010 Capitol News Company, LLC


http://maxblumenthal.com/2010/06/the-israeli-medias-flotilla-fail/ The Israeli Media's Flotilla Fail On 06.22.10, By Max Blumenthal My summaty Israeli media's shambolic performance following flotilla massacre originally published Hebrew Dvorit Shargal's excellent Israeli media blog, Velvet Underground. The English version follows: If raid Gaza Freedom Flotilla disaster Israel Defense Forces, aftermath demonstrated equally bewildering performance Israeli media. The IDF Spokesman's Office churned one misleading claim another, one implausible next, seeking implant public's mind version events bore little relation reality. To degree, expected; startling see Israel's respected reporters lined serve military stenographers, barely challenging IDF's rapidly changing versions events. IDF claims flotilla passengers' links Al Qaida, anti-Semitic statements shouted Israeli Navy, terrorist intentions eagerly broadcast Israeli media without second thought. When independent reporters forced IDF retract "clarify" claims, Israeli news outlets refused correct errors, covered without acknowledgment. It happened I arrived Israel research trip day flotilla raid. As result, I able something I always thought basic journalistic practice, basic it's supposed applied routinely: Asking implicated party story produce evidence claims. What I found bewildering least judging Israeli media reports, few, any, mainstream reporters applied practice, visiting colleague job – nobody bothered correct withdraw original report. On June 2, IDF disseminated press release entitled, "Attackers IDF soldiers found Al Qaeda mercenaries." The accusation accompanied conclusive evidence — IDF reported Mavi Marmara passengers equipped night-vision goggles (gasp!). This stop Yedioth's Ron Ben-Yishai, embedded Navy commandos, amplifying baseless charge. Citing "interrogation" Marmara passengers — "lynchers," called — Ben-Yishai wrote day, "Some among [flotilla passengers] believed ties World Jihad groups, mainly Al Qaeda." The article made reference efforts part Ben Yishai investigate claim, seem think ask IDF release dangerous operatives Osama Bin Laden — presumably would attack again, wouldn't they? • On June 3, Israeli journalist Lia Tarachansky Real News Network I placed calls IDF Spokesman's Office demand evidence Marmara's Al Qaeda ties. We received identical responses spokespeople IDF's Israel North America desks: "We don't evidence. The press release based information National Security Council." Hours later, IDF retracted claim, changing title press release to, "Attackers IDF Soldiers Found Without Identification Papers." Despite official retraction, Ben-Yishai's article remains uncorrected. On June 4, IDF released audio clip purporting consist transmissions Mavi Marmara Naval warship. "Go back Aushwitz!" Marmara passenger shouted, according IDF. YNet Haaretz reported reproduced audio clip without investigating authenticity. Forget voice uttering anti-Semitic slur sounded like mentally disturbed teenager; reporters performed cursory search IDF Spokeman's Office website, would found longer clip released May 31 featured dramatically different exchange Marmara mention Auschwitz. Further, voice flotilla organizer Huwaida Arraf featured "Aushwitz" clip, yet Arraf aboard Marmara (she Challenger One). Could IDF doctored audio exploit public hysteria surrounding issue anti-Semitism? On blog, I pointed discrepancies IDF's footage raised question doctoring. The next day, IDF conceded fact doctored footage, releasing "clarification" new clip claiming consist "full" exchange Navy flotilla. Unfortunately, authenticity new clip impossible verify. Despite IDF's admission, YNet Haaretz corrected original reports, though Haaretz least altered headline. Once doctoring exposed, New York Times covered episode detail, directing international attention triumph independent online reporting apparent failure Israel's parochial press corps. On June 7, Haaretz's Anshel Pfeffer reported IDF press release claiming without evidence five flotilla passengers links international terror. The press release larded highly implausible claims, including Ken O'Keefe, runs aid organization Tony Blair's sister-in-law, planning train Hamas commando unit Gaza Strip. When I called IDF Spokesman's Office, I learned again, evidence available support press release. "There limited intelligence give specific case," Sgt. Chen Arad told me. "Obviously I'm unable give information." Did Pfeffer demand evidence? If answered manner I did, Haaretz publish unsubstantiated spin fact? Joined Haaretz military correspondents Avi Isacharoff Amos Harel, Pfeffer became channel another daytime deception IDF. On May 31, three reporters produced article based exclusively testimony Naval commandos — flotilla passengers' side story ignored — claiming faced live fire lynching attempts Marmara passengers. Since story published, IDF produced scant evidence support either accusation. The article accompanied suspicious photo IDF Spokesman's Office depicting bearded Muslim man brandishing knife surrounded photojournalists. Daylight beamed window behind man. Haaretz's caption, sourced IDF, asserted photo taken "after" commandos boarded Marmara. However, commandos raided ship night, photo taken day. Once again, IDF's story fishy. I called Sgt. Arad IDF Spokesman's Office investigate. He told evidence support photo's questionable caption. Soon phone conversation, Haaretz quietly altered caption, removing claim photo taken "after" commando raid. For nearly week, false photo caption remained intact. Why Haaretz suddenly change it? The plausible explanation paper received tip IDF Spokesman's Office. If true, tip-off suggests scandalous level coordination Israeli military country's media. In wake flotilla raid, Israeli journalists unique opportunity lead global media's investigation bloodbath occurred deck Mavi Marmara. After all, one better access military eyewitnesses aboard flotilla. Instead, many among Israeli press corps allowed conscripted IDF's hapless information war, leaving important task investigating raid independent reporters remembered view claims nation's military extreme skepticism. So well-connected, experienced reporters follow IDF baton willingly, fail follow IDF claims retracted? Is simple bias, desire present military best possible light, desire strong abandon duty readers verify information? Are afraid sanctions, losing contacts access information? Do fear personal reprisals? Their readers, world media still relies Israeli journalism vital source information, need know.

The Runaway General Stanley McChrystal, Obama's top commander Afghanistan, seized control war never taking eye real enemy: The wimps White House By Michael Hastings Jun 22, 2010 10:00 AM EDT This article originally appeared RS 1108/1109 July 8-22, 2010. 'Howed I get screwed going dinner?" demands Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It's Thursday night mid-April, commander U.S. NATO forces Afghanistan sitting four-star suite HOtel Westminster Paris. He's France sell new war strategy NATO allies — keep fiction, essence, actually allies. Since McChrystal took year ago, Afghan war become exclusive property United States. Opposition war already toppled Dutch government, forced resignation Germany's president sparked Canada Netherlands announce withdrawal 4,500 troops. McChrystal Paris keep French, lost 40 soldiers Afghanistan, going wobbly him. "The dinner comes position, sir," says chief staff, Col. Charlie Flynn. McChrystal turns sharply chair. "Hey, Charlie," asks, "does come position?" McChrystal gives middle finger. The general stands looks around suite traveling staff 10 converted full-scale operations center. The tables crowded silver Panasonic Toughbooks, blue cables crisscross hotel's thick carpet, hooked satellite dishes provide encrypted phone e-mail communications. Dressed off-the-rack civilian casual — blue tie, button-down shirt, dress slacks — McChrystal way comfort zone. Paris, one advisers says, "most anti-McChrystal city imagine." The general hates fancy restaurants, rejecting place candles tables "Gucci." He prefers Bud Light Lime (his favorite beer) Bordeaux, Talladega Nights (his favorite movie) Jean-Luc Godard. Besides, public eye never place McChrystal felt comfortable: Before President Obama put charge war Afghanistan, spent five years running Pentagon's secretive black ops. "What's update Kandahar bombing?" McChrystal asks Flynn. The city rocked two massive car bombs past day alone, calling question general's assurances wrest Taliban. "We two KIAs, hasn't confirmed," Flynn says. McChrystal takes final look around suite. At 55, gaunt lean, unlike older version Christian Bale Rescue Dawn. His slate-blue eyes unsettling ability drill lock you. If you've fucked disappointed him, destroy soul without need raise voice. "I'd rather ass kicked roomful people go dinner," McChrystal says. He pauses beat. "Unfortunately," adds, "no one room could it." With that, he's door. "Who's going dinner with?" I ask one aides. "Some French minister," aide tells me. "It's fucking gay." The next morning, McChrystal team gather prepare speech giving Ecole Militaire, French military academy. The general prides sharper ballsier anyone else, brashness comes price: Although McChrystal charge war year, short time managed piss almost everyone stake conflict. Last fall, question-and-answer session following speech gave London, McChrystal dismissed counterterrorism strategy advocated Vice President Joe Biden "shortsighted," saying would lead state "Chaos-istan." The remarks earned smackdown president himself, summoned general terse private meeting aboard Air Force One. The message McChrystal seemed clear: Shut fuck up, keep lower profile Now, flipping printout cards speech Paris, McChrystal wonders aloud Biden question might get today, respond. "I never know what's going pop I'm there, that's problem," says. Then, unable help themselves, staff imagine general dismissing vice president good one- liner. "Are asking Vice President Biden?" McChrystal says laugh. "Who's that?" "Biden?" suggests top adviser. "Did say: Bite Me?" When Barack Obama entered Oval Office, immediately set deliver important campaign promise foreign policy: refocus war Afghanistan led us invade first place. "I want American people understand," announced March 2009. "We clear focused goal: disrupt, dismantle defeat Al Qaeda Pakistan Afghanistan." He ordered another 21,000 troops Kabul, largest increase since war began 2001. Taking advice Pentagon Joint Chiefs Staff, also fired Gen. David McKiernan — U.S. NATO commander Afghanistan — replaced man didn't know met briefly: Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It first time top general relieved duty wartime 50 years, since Harry Truman fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur height Korean War. Even though voted Obama, McChrystal new commander chief failed outset connect. The general first encountered Obama week took office, president met dozen senior military officials room Pentagon known Tank. According sources familiar meeting, McChrystal thought Obama looked "uncomfortable intimidated" roomful military brass. Their first one-on-one meeting took place Oval Office four months later, McChrystal got Afghanistan job, didn't go much better. "It 10-minute photo op," says adviser McChrystal. "Obama clearly didn't know anything him, was. Here's guy who's going run fucking war, didn't seem engaged. The Boss pretty disappointed." From start, McChrystal determined place personal stamp Afghanistan, use laboratory controversial military strategy known counterinsurgency. COIN, theory known, new gospel Pentagon brass, doctrine attempts square military's preference high-tech violence demands fighting protracted wars failed states. COIN calls sending huge numbers ground troops destroy enemy, live among civilian population slowly rebuild, build scratch, another nation's government — process even staunchest advocates admit requires years, decades, achieve. The theory essentially rebrands military, expanding authority (and funding) encompass diplomatic political sides warfare: Think Green Berets armed Peace Corps. In 2006, Gen. David Petraeus beta-tested theory "surge" Iraq, quickly gained hardcore following think-tankers, journalists, military officers civilian officials. Nicknamed "COINdinistas" cultish zeal, influential cadre believed doctrine would perfect solution Afghanistan. All needed general enough charisma political savvy implement it. As McChrystal leaned Obama ramp war, fearlessness used track terrorists Iraq: Figure enemy operates, faster ruthless everybody else, take fuckers out. After arriving Afghanistan last June, general conducted policy review, ordered Defense Secretary Robert Gates. The now-infamous report leaked press, conclusion dire: If didn't send another 40,000 troops — swelling number U.S. forces Afghanistan nearly half — danger "mission failure." The White House furious. McChrystal, felt, trying bully Obama, opening charges weak national security unless general wanted. It Obama versus Pentagon, Pentagon determined kick president's ass. Last fall, top general calling troops, Obama launched three-month review re-evaluate strategy Afghanistan. "I found time painful," McChrystal tells one several lengthy interviews. "I selling unsellable position." For general, crash course Beltway politics — battle pitted experienced Washington insiders like Vice President Biden, argued prolonged counterinsurgency campaign Afghanistan would plunge America military quagmire without weakening international terrorist networks. "The entire COIN strategy fraud perpetuated American people," says Douglas Macgregor, retired colonel leading critic counterinsurgency attended West Point McChrystal. "The idea going spend trillion dollars reshape culture Islamic world utter nonsense. In end, however, McChrystal got almost exactly wanted. On December 1st, speech West Point, president laid reasons fighting war Afghanistan bad idea: It's expensive; we're economic crisis; decade-long commitment would sap American power; Al Qaeda shifted base operations Pakistan. Then, without ever using words "victory" "win," Obama announced would send additional 30,000 troops Afghanistan, almost many McChrystal requested. The president thrown weight, however hesitantly, behind counterinsurgency crowd. Today, McChrystal gears offensive southern Afghanistan, prospects kind success look bleak. In June, death toll U.S. troops passed 1,000, number IEDs doubled. Spending hundreds billions dollars fifth-poorest country earth failed win civilian population, whose attitude toward U.S. troops ranges intensely wary openly hostile. Thetiggest military operation year — ferocious offensive began February retake southern town Marja — continues drag on, prompting McChrystal refer "bleeding ulcer." In June, Afghanistan officially outpaced Vietnam longest war American history — Obama quietly begun back away deadline set withdrawing U.S. troops July next year. The president finds stuck something even insane quagmire: quagmire knowingly walked into, even though it's precisely kind gigantic, mind-numbing, multigenerational nation-building project explicitly said didn't want. Even support McChrystal strategy counterinsurgency know whatever general manages accomplish Afghanistan, it's going look like Vietnam Desert Storm. "It's going look like win, smell like win taste like win," says Maj. Gen. Bill Mayville, serves chief operations McChrystal. "This going end argument." The night speech Paris, McChrystal staff head Kitty O'Shea's, Irish pub catering tourists, around corner hotel. His wife, Annie, joined rare visit: Since Iraq War began 2003, seen husband less 30 days year. Though Annie's 33rd wedding anniversary, McChrystal invited inner circle along dinner drinks "least Gucci" place staff could find. His wife isn't surprised. "He took Jack Box I dressed formalwear," says laugh. The general's staff handpicked collection killers, spies, geniuses, patriots, political operators outright maniacs. There's former head British Special Forces, two Navy Seals, Afghan Special Forces commando, lawyer, two fighter pilots least two dozen combat veterans counterinsurgency experts. They jokingly refer Team America, taking name South Park-esque sendup military cluelessness, pride can-do attitude disdain authority. After arriving Kabul last summer, Team America set changing culture International Security Assistance Force, NATO-led mission known. (U.S. soldiers taken deriding ISAF short "I Suck Fighting" "In Sandals Flip-Flops.") McChrystal banned alcohol base, kicked Burger King symbols American excess, expanded morning briefing include thousands officers refashioned command center Situational Awareness Room, free-flowing information hub modeled Mayor Mike Bloomberg's offices New York. He also set manic pace staff, becoming legendary sleeping four hours night, running seven miles morning, eating one meal day. (In month I spend around general, I witness eating once.) It's kind superhuman narrative built around him, staple almost every media profile, ability go without sleep food translates possibility man single-handedly winning war. By midnight Kitty O'Shea's, much Team America completely shitfaced. Two officers Irish jig mixed steps traditional Afghan wedding dance, McChrystal's top advisers lock arms sing slurred song invention."Afghanistan!" bellow."Afghanistan!" They call Afghanistan song. McChrystal steps away circle, observing team. "All men," tells me. "I'd die them. And they'd die me." The assembled men may look sound like bunch combat veterans letting steam, fact tight-knit group represents powerful force shaping U.S. policy Afghanistan. While McChrystal men indisputable command military aspects war, equivalent position diplomatic political side. Instead, assortment administration players compete Afghan portfolio: U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, Special Representative Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke, National Security Advisor Jim Jones Secretary State Hillary Clinton, mention 40 coalition ambassadors host talking heads try insert mess, John Kerry John McCain. This diplomatic incoherence effectively allowed McChrystal's team call shots hampered efforts build stable credible government Afghanistan. "It jeopardizes mission," says Stephen Biddle, senior fellow Council Foreign Relations supports McChrystal. "The military cannot create governance reform." Part problem structural: The Defense Department budget exceeds $600 billion year, State Department receives $50 billion. But part problem personal: In private, Team McChrystal likes talk shit many Obama's top people diplomatic side. One aide calls Jim Jones, retired four-star general veteran Cold War, "clown" remains "stuck 1985." Politicians like McCain Kerry, says another aide, "turn up, meeting Karzai, criticize airport press conference, get back Sunday talk shows. Frankly, it's helpful." Only Hillary Clinton receives good reviews McChrystal's inner circle. "Hillary Stan's back strategic review," says adviser. "She said, 'If Stan wants it, give needs.'" McChrystal reserves special skepticism Holbrooke, official charge reintegrating Taliban. "The Boss says he's like wounded animal," says member general's team. "Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors he's going get fired, makes dangerous. He's brilliant guy, comes in, pulls lever, whatever grasp onto. But COIN, can't someone yanking shit." At one point trip Paris, McChrystal checks BlackBerry. "Oh, another e-mail Holbrooke," groans. "I don't even want open it." He clicks message reads salutation loud, stuffs BladkBerry back pocket, bothering conceal annoyance. "Make sure don't get leg," aide jokes, referring e-mail. By far crucial — strained — relationship McChrystal Eikenberry, U.S. ambassador. According close two men, Eikenberry — retired three-star general served Afghanistan 2002 2005 — can't stand former subordinate calling shots. He's also furious McChrystal, backed NATO's allies, refused put Eikenberry pivotal role viceroy Afghanistan, would made diplomatic equivalent general. The job instead went British Ambassador Mark Sedwill — move effectively increased McChrystal's influence diplomacy shutting powerful rival. "In reality, position needs filled American weight," says U.S. official familiar negotiations. The relationship strained January, classified cable Eikenberry wrote leaked The New York Times. The cable scathing prescient. The ambassador offered brutal critique McChrystal's strategy, dismissed President Hamid Karzai "not adequate strategic partner," cast doubt whether counterinsurgency plan would "sufficient" deal Al Qaeda. "We become deeply engaged way extricate ourselves," Eikenberry warned, "short allowing country descend lawlessness chaos." McChrystal team blindsided cable. "I like Karl, I've known years, they'd never said anything like us before," says McChrystal, adds felt "betrayed" leak. "Here's one covers flank history books. Now fail, say, 'I told so.'" The striking example McChrystal's usurpation diplomatic policy handling Karzai. It McChrystal, diplomats like Eikenberry Holbrooke, enjoys best relationship man America relying lead Afghanistan. The doctrine counterinsurgency requires credible government, since Karzai considered credible people, McChrystal worked hard make so. Over past months, accompanied president 10 trips around country, standing beside political meetings, shuras, Kandahar. In February, day doomed offensive Marja, McChrystal even drove president's palace get sign would largest military operation year. Karzai's staff, however, insisted president sleeping cold could disturbed. After several hours haggling, McChrystal finally enlisted aid Afghanistan's defense minister, persuaded Karzai's people wake president nap. This one central flaws McChrystal's counterinsurgency strategy: The need build credible government puts us mercy whatever tin-pot leader we've backed — danger Eikenberry explicitly warned cable. Even Team McChrystal privately acknowledges Karzai less-than-ideal partner. "He's locked palace past year," laments one general's top advisers. At times, Karzai actively undermined McChrystal's desire put charge. During recent visit Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Karzai met three U.S. soldiers wounded Uruzgan province. "General," called McChrystal, "I didn't even know fighting Uruzgan!" Growing military brat, McChrystal exhibited mixture brilliance cockiness would follow throughout career. His father fought Korea Vietnam, retiring two-star general, four brothers joined armed services. Moving around different bases, McChrystal took solace baseball, sport made pretense hiding superiority: In Little League, would call strikes crowd whipping fastball middle. McChrystal entered West Point 1972, U.S. military close all-time low popularity. His class last graduate academy started admit women. The "Prison Hudson," known then, potent mix testosterone, hooliganism reactionary patriotism. Cadets repeatedly trashed mess hall food fights, birthdays celebrated tradition called "rat fucking," often left birthday boy outside snow mud, covered shaving cream. "It pretty control," says Lt. Gen. David Barno, classmate went serve top commander Afghanistan 2003 2005. The class, filled Barno calls "huge talent" "wild-eyed teenagers strong sense idealism," also produced Gen. Ray Odierno, current commander U.S. forces Iraq. The son general, McChrystal also ringleader campus dissidents — dual role taught thrive rigid, top-down environment thumbing nose authority every chance got. He accumulated 100 hours demerits drinking, partying insubordination — record classmates boasted made "century man." One classmate, asked named, recalls finding McChrystal passed shower downing case beer hidden sink. The troublemaking almost got kicked out, spent hours subjected forced marches Area, paved courtyard unruly cadets disciplined. "I'd come visit, I'd end spending time library, Stan Area," recalls Annie, began dating McChrystal 1973. McChrystal wound ranking 298 class 855, serious underachievement man widely regarded brilliant. His compelling work extracurricular: As managing editor The Pointer, West Point literary magazine, McChrystal wrote seven short stories eerily foreshadow many issues would confront career. In one tale, fictional officer complains difficulty training foreign troops fight; another, 19-year- old soldier kills boy mistakes terrorist. In "Brinkman's Note," piece suspense fiction, unnamed narrator appears trying stop plot assassinate president. It turns out, however, narrator assassin, he's able infiltrate White House: "The President strode smiling. From right coat pocket raincoat I carried, I slowly drew forth 32-caliber pistol. In Brinkman's failure, I succeeded." After graduation, 2nd Lt. Stanley McChrystal entered Army broken wake Vietnam. "We really felt peacetime generation," recalls. "There Gulf War, even didn't feel like big deal." So McChrystal spent career action was: He enrolled Special Forces school became regimental commander 3rd Ranger Battalion 1986. It dangerous position, even peacetime — nearly two dozen Rangers killed training accidents Eighties. It also unorthodox career path: Most soldiers want climb ranks general don't go Rangers. Displaying penchant transforming systems considers outdated, McChrystal set revolutionize training regime Rangers. He introduced mixed martial arts, required every soldier qualify night-vision goggles rifle range forced troops build endurance weekly marches involving heavy backpacks. In late 1990s, McChrystal shrewdly improved inside game, spending year Harvard's Kennedy School Government Council Foreign Relations, co-authored treatise merits drawbacks humanitarian interventionism. But moved ranks, McChrystal relied skills learned troublemaking kid West Point: knowing precisely far could go rigid military hierarchy without getting tossed out. Being highly intelligent badass, discovered, could take far — especially political chaos followed September 11th. "He focused," says Annie. "Even young officer seemed know wanted do. I don't think personality changed years." By accounts, McChrystal's career least two times now. As Pentagon spokesman invasion Iraq, general seemed like White House mouthpiece up-and-coming commander reputation speaking mind. When Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made infamous "stuff happens" remark looting Baghdad, McChrystal backed up. A days later, echoed president's Mission Accomplished gaffe insisting major combat operations Iraq over. But next stint — overseeing military's elite units, including Rangers, Navy Seals Delta Force — McChrystal took part cover-up would destroyed career lesser man. After Cpl. Pat Tillman, former-NFL-star-turned-Ranger, accidentally killed troops Afghanistan April 2004, McChrystal took active role creating impression Tillman died hands Taliban fighters. He signed falsified recommendation Silver Star suggested Tillman killed enemy fire. (McChrystal would later claim didn't read recommendation closely enough — strange excuse commander known laserlike attention minute details.) A week later, McChrystal sent memo chain command, specifically warning President Bush avoid mentioning cause Tillman's death. "If circumstances Corporal Tillman's death become public," wrote, could cause "public embarrassment" president. "The false narrative, McChrystal clearly helped construct, diminished Pat's true actions," wrote Tillman's mother, Mary, book Boots Ground Dusk. McChrystal got away it, added, "golden boy" Rumsfeld Bush, loved willingness get things done, even included bending rules skipping chain command. Nine days Tillman's death, McChrystal promoted major general. Two years later, 2006, McChrystal tainted scandal involving detainee abuse torture Camp Nama Iraq. According report Human Rights Watch, prisoners camp subjected now-familiar litany abuse: stress positions, dragged naked mud. McChrystal disciplined scandal, even though interrogator camp reported seeing inspect prison multiple times. But experience unsettling McChrystal tried prevent detainee operations placed command Afghanistan, viewing "political swamp," according U.S. official. In May 2009, McChrystal prepared confirmation hearings, staff prepared hard questions Camp Nama Tillman cover-up. But scandals barely made ripple Congress, McChrystal soon way back Kabul run war Afghanistan. The media, large extent, also given McChrystal pass controversies. Where Gen. Petraeus kind dweeb, teacher's pet Ranger's tab, McChrystal snake-eating rebel, "Jedi" commander, Newsweek called him. He didn't care teenage son came home blue hair mohawk. He speaks mind candor rare high-ranking official. He asks opinions, seems genuinely interested response. He gets briefings iPod listens books tape. He carries custom-made set nunchucks convoy engraved name four stars, itinerary often bears fresh quote Bruce Lee. ("There limits. There plateaus, must stay there, must go beyond them.") He went dozens nighttime raids time Iraq, unprecedented top commander, turned missions unannounced, almost entourage. "The fucking lads love Stan McChrystal," says British officer serves Kabul. "You'd Somewhere, Iraq, someone would take knee beside you, corporal would like 'Who fuck that?' And it's fucking Stan McChrystal." It doesn't hurt McChrystal also extremely successful head Joint Special Operations Command, elite forces carry government's darkest ops. During Iraq surge, team killed captured thousands insurgents, including Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, leader Al Qaeda Iraq. "JSOC killing machine," says Maj. Gen. Mayville, chief operations. McChrystal also open new ways killing. He systematically mapped terrorist networks, targeting specific insurgents hunting — often help cyberfreaks traditionally shunned military. "The Boss would find 24-year-old kid nose ring, fucking brilliant degree MIT, sitting corner 16 computer monitors humming," says Special Forces commando worked McChrystal Iraq serves staff Kabul. "He'd say, 'Hey — fucking muscleheads couldn't find lunch without help. You got work together guys.'" Even new role America's leading evangelist counterinsurgency, McChrystal retains deep-seated instincts terrorist hunter. To put pressure Taliban, upped number Special Forces units Afghanistan four 19. "You better hitting four five targets tonight," McChrystal tell Navy Seal sees hallway headquarters. Then he'll add, "I'm going scold morning it, though." In fact, general frequently finds apologizing disastrous consequences counterinsurgency. In first four months year, NATO forces killed 90 civilians, 76 percent period 2009 — record created tremendous resentment among population COIN theory intent winning over. In February, Special Forces night raid ended deaths two pregnant Afghan women allegations cover-up, April, protests erupted Kandahar U.S. forces accidentally shot bus, killing five Afghans. "We've shot amazing number people," McChrystal recently conceded. Despite tragedies miscues, McChrystal issued strictest directives avoid civilian casualties U.S. military ever encountered war zone. It's "insurgent math," calls — every innocent person kill, create 10 new enemies. He ordered convoys curtail reckless driving, put restrictions use air power severely limited night raids. He regularly apologizes Hamid Karzai civilians killed, berates commanders responsible civilian deaths. "For while," says one U.S. official, "the dangerous place Afghanistan front McChrystal 'civ cas' incident." The ISAF command even discussed ways make killing something win award for: There's talk creating new medal "courageous restraint," buzzword that's unlikely gain much traction gung-ho culture U.S. military. But however strategic may be, McChrystal's new marching orders caused intense backlash among troops. Being told hold fire, soldiers complain, puts greater danger. "Bottom line?" says former Special Forces operator spent years Iraq Afghanistan. "I would love kick McChrystal nuts. His rules engagement put soldiers' lives even greater danger. Every real soldier tell thing." In March, McChrystal traveled Combat Outpost JFM — small encampment outskirts Kandahar — confront accusations troops directly. It typically bold move general. Only two days earlier, received e-mail Israel Arroyo, 25-year-old staff sergeant asked McChrystal go mission unit. "I writing said don't care troops made harder defend ourselves," Arroyo wrote. Within hours, McChrystal responded personally: "I'm saddened accusation I don't care soldiers, something I suspect soldier takes personally professionally — least I do. But I know perceptions depend upon perspective time, I respect every soldier's view own." Then showed Arroyo's outpost went foot patrol troops — bullshit photo-op stroll market, real live operation dangerous war zone. Six weeks later, McChrystal returned Paris, general received another e-mail Arroyo. A 23-year- old corporal named Michael Ingram — one soldiers McChrystal gone patrol — killed IED day earlier. It third man 25-member platoon lost year, Arroyo writing see general would attend Ingram's memorial service. "He started look you," Arroyo wrote. McChrystal said would try make pay respects soon possible. The night general scheduled visit Sgt. Arroyo's platoon memorial, I arrive Combat Outpost JFM speak soldiers gone patrol with. JFM small encampment, ringed high blast walls guard towers. Almost soldiers repeated combat tours Iraq Afghanistan, seen worst fighting wars. But especially angered Ingram's death. His commanders repeatedly requested permission tear house Ingram killed, noting often used combat position Taliban. But due McChrystal's new restrictions avoid upsetting civilians, request denied. "These abandoned houses," fumes Staff Sgt. Kennith Hicks. "Nobody coming back live them." One soldier shows list new regulations platoon given. "Patrol areas reasonably certain defend lethal force," laminated card reads. For soldier traveled halfway around world fight, that's like telling cop patrol areas knows won't make arrests. "Does make fucking sense?" asks Pfc. Jared Pautsch. "We drop fucking bomb place. You sit ask yourself: What here?" The rules handed McChrystal intended — they've distorted passed chain command — knowing nothing lessen anger troops ground. "Fuck, I came heard McChrystal charge, I thought would get fucking gun on," says Hicks, served three tours combat. "I get COIN. I get that. McChrystal comes here, explains it, makes sense. But goes away bird, time directives get passed us Big Army, they're fucked — either somebody trying cover ass, don't understand themselves. But we're fucking losing thing." McChrystal team show next day. Underneath tent, general 45-minute discussion two dozen soldiers. The atmosphere tense. "I ask what's going world, I think it's important understand big picture well," McChrystal begins. "How's company doing? You guys feeling sorry yourselves? Anybody? Anybody feel like you're losing?" McChrystal says. "Sir, guys here, sir, think we're losing, sir," says Hicks. McChrystal nods. "Strength leading don't want lead," tells men. "You're leading example. That's do. Particularly it's really, really hard, hurts inside." Then spends 20 minutes talking counterinsurgency, diagramming concepts principles whiteboard. He makes COIN seem like common sense, he's careful bullshit men. "We knee-deep decisive year," tells them. The Taliban, insists, longer initiative — "but I don't think do, either." It's similar talk gave Paris, it's winning hearts minds among soldiers. "This philosophical part works think tanks," McChrystal tries joke. "But doesn't get reception infantry companies." During question-and-answer period, frustration boils over. The soldiers complain allowed use lethal force, watching insurgents detain freed lack evidence. They want able fight — like Iraq, like Afghanistan McChrystal. 'We aren't putting fear Taliban," one soldier says. "Winning hearts minds COIN coldblooded thing," McChrystal says, citing oft-repeated maxim can't kill way Afghanistan. "The Russians killed 1 million Afghans, didn't work." "I'm saying go kill everybody, sir," soldier persists. "You say we've stopped momentum insurgency. I don't believe that's true area. The pull back, restrain ourselves, stronger it's getting." "I agree you," McChrystal says. "In area, we've made progress, probably. You show strength here, use fire. What I'm telling is, fire costs you. What want do? You want wipe population resettle it?" A soldier complains rules, insurgent doesn't weapon immediately assumed civilian. "That's way game is," McChrystal says. "It's complex. I can't decide: It's shirts skins, we'll kill shirts." As discussion ends, McChrystal seems sense hasn't succeeded easing men's anger. He makes one last-ditch effort reach them, acknowledging death Cpl. Ingram. "There's way I make easier," tells them. "No way I pretend won't hurt. No way I tell feel that. . . . I tell you, you're great job. Don't let frustration get you." The session ends clapping, real resolution. McChrystal may sold President Obama counterinsurgency, many men aren't buying it. When comes Afghanistan, history McChrystal's side. The foreign invader success Genghis Khan — wasn't hampered things like human rights, economic development press scrutiny. The COIN doctrine, bizarrely, draws inspiration biggest Western military embarrassments recent memory: France's nasty war Algeria (lost 1962) American misadventure Vietnam (lost 1975). McChrystal, like advocates COIN, readily acknowledges counterinsurgency campaigns inherently messy, expensive easy lose. "Even Afghans confused Afghanistan," says. But even somehow manages succeed, years bloody fighting Afghan kids pose threat U.S. homeland, war little shut Al Qaeda, shifted operations Pakistan. Dispatching 150,000 troops build new schools, roads, mosques water-treatment facilities around Kandahar like trying stop drug war Mexico occupying Arkansas building Baptist churches Little Rock. "It's cynical, politically," says Marc Sageman, former CIA case officer extensive experience region. "Afghanistan vital interest — there's nothing us there." In mid-May, two weeks visiting troops Kandahar, McChrystal travels White House high-level visit Hamid Karzai. It triumphant moment general, one demonstrates much command — Kabul Washington. In East Room, packed journalists dignitaries, President Obama sings praises Karzai. The two leaders talk great relationship is, pain feel civilian casualties. They mention word "progress" 16 times hour. But mention victory. Still, • session represents forceful commitment Obama made McChrystal's strategy months. "There denying progress Afghan people made recent years — education, health care economic development," president says. "As I saw lights across Kabul I landed — lights would visible years earlier." It disconcerting observation Obama make. During worst years Iraq, Bush administration real progress point to, officials used offer exact evidence success. "It one first impressions," one GOP official said 2006, landing Baghdad height sectarian violence. "So many lights shining brightly." So language Iraq War Obama administration turned — talk progress, city lights, metrics like health care education. Rhetoric years ago would mocked. "They trying manipulate perceptions definition victory — victory even defined recognizable," says Celeste Ward, senior defense analyst RAND Corporation served political adviser U.S. commanders Iraq 2006. "That's game we're right now. What need, strategic purposes, create perception didn't get run off. The facts ground great, going become great near future." But facts ground, history proven, offer little deterrent military determined stay course. Even closest McChrystal know rising anti-war sentiment home doesn't begin reflect deeply fucked things Afghanistan. "If Americans pulled back started paying attention war, would become even less popular," senior adviser McChrystal says. Such realism, however, doesn't prevent advocates counterinsurgency dreaming big: Instead beginning withdraw troops next year, Obama promised, military hopes ramp counterinsurgency campaign even further. "There's possibility could ask another surge U.S. forces next summer see success here," senior military official Kabul tells me. Back Afghanistan, less month White House meeting Karzai talk "progress," McChrystal hit biggest blow vision counterinsurgency. Since last year, Pentagon planning launch major military operation summer Kandahar, country's second-largest city Taliban's original home base. It supposed decisive turning point war — primary reason troop surge McChrystal wrested Obama late last year. But June 10th, acknowledging military still needs lay groundwork, general announced postponing offensive fall. Rather one big battle, like Fallujah Ramadi, U.S. troops implement McChrystal calls "rising tide security." The Afghan police army enter Kandahar attempt seize control neighborhoods, U.S. pours $90 million aid city win civilian population. Even proponents counterinsurgency hard-pressed explain new plan. "This isn't classic operation," says U.S. military official. "It's going Black Hawk Down. There aren't going doors kicked in." Other U.S. officials insist doors going kicked in, it's going kinder, gentler offensive disaster Marja. "The Taliban jackboot city," says military official. "We remove them, way doesn't alienate population." When Vice President Biden briefed new plan Oval Office, insiders say shocked see much mirrored gradual plan counterterrorism advocated last fall. "This looks like CT-plus!" said, according U.S. officials familiar meeting. Whatever nature new plan, delay underscores fundamental flaws counterinsurgency. After nine years war, Taliban simply remains strongly entrenched U.S. military openly attack. The people COIN seeks win — Afghan people — want us there. Our supposed ally, President Karzai, used influence delay offensive, massive influx aid championed McChrystal likely make things worse. "Throwing money problem exacerbates problem," says Andrew Wilder, expert Tufts University studied effect aid southern Afghanistan. "A tsunami cash fuels corruption, delegitimizes government creates environment we're picking winners losers" — process fuels resentment hostility among civilian population. So far, counterinsurgency succeeded creating never-ending demand primary product supplied military: perpetual war. There reason President Obama studiously avoids using word "victory" talks Afghanistan. Winning, would seem, really possible. Not even Stanley McChrystal charge.

That right choice. As David Cameron Jeff Sachs argued earlier year, women hold key development world's poorest countries — education, enterprise, micro-finance healthcare. Investing women pays dividends throughout entire community." 2. "I see DFID key, joined-up, integrated department, bright star Whitehall constellation, department state development developing world.

See hus analysis EAS also US, Japan, Chinese urbanization trade patterns.. Nothing new, valuable coming him. The Australian - 19 Jun 10 Embracing everyone US India Greg Sheridan, Foreign editor GEORGE Yeo, Singapore's Foreign Minister, one dazzlingly clever people could meet Southeast Asia. Singapore society notoriously produces hardheads strategic outlook. But Yeo combines Singapore's characteristic hard-headedness depth historical understanding context, well lively human sympathy diversity region surrounds him, I, event, find almost unique. I remember interviewing height East Asian economic crisis 1997 asking whether crisis shattered idea Asia growing centre global economy, numerous foolishly triumphalist Western commentators suggesting. "No doesn't," Yeo told me. "At might put back forecasts five 10 years." It moved graph little right, didn't change trends. On that, Yeo absolutely right. But also Yeo's ability apply insights history real problems Asia today make formidable. This week, Yeo spent days Australia I caught one slightly mesmerising historical tour de force conversations specialises. It secret Singapore serious reservations Kevin Rudd's proposal establish Asia-Pacific Community. The Prime Minister wanted US, India Russia included regional body could deal strategic issues well trade economics. Singapore's hesitation Rudd proposal came thought Association Southeast Asian Nations, key member, could sidelined. I asked Yeo whether region clear wanted organisations accomplish. "We still need lot discussion," said. "The vision going change dramatically, emergence China India global stage. The configuration evolving much faster us would preferred. But that's reality we've got work with. We need regional architecture able accommodate stresses. The single important relationship US China. Increasingly, relationship India China becoming important. I think eventually triangular relationship decide big issues war peace Asia century - triangle consisting US, China India." Yeo saw Rudd Foreign Minister Stephen Smith Canberra describes Canberra Singapore harmony evolution regional organisations. This saw played out: "When Prime Minister Rudd proposed APC, Dick Woolcott (Rudd's envoy) went round region. He visit countries. He made quite plain big countries ASEAN need involved. We talked among quite soon conclusion reached ASEAN going sidelined. So immediate blowback region. "To PM Rudd's credit quickly clarified this, ASEAN central conception APC vision beginning. I said, 'All us region relieved hear that'. "Separately (former Japanese) prime minister (Yukio) Hatoyama articulating view East Asian region apparently centred China, Japan Korea. It created, would expect, natural reaction Southeast Asia. That got us thinking region. How keep Russia US region way that's comfortable. For long time we've thinking China, recently India." Yeo pointed earlier regional organisations also evolved slowly, particular East Asia Summit, includes Australia New Zealand, well ASEAN, China, Japan, South Korea India. He said: "It took us long time create EAS structure. Some preferred based ASEAN plus three (China, Japan, Korea), harking back (former Malaysian prime minister) Mahathir (Mohamad)'s East Asian caucus. "Others felt that's limiting. If it's ASEAN plus three, may little lop-sided economic weight plus three. So thought India one side, Australia New Zealand south, there's certain natural equipoise. "Then took many discussions. The Russians wanted join EAS felt rushed. Russia important country. There unhappiness Russians accommodate EAS time. (Former US) President (George W.) Bush want join EAS worried EAS might exclude US region. We told American friends could purely Asian thing Australia New Zealand it. In case, countries like Singapore would never want EAS exclusive. What would threaten us world developed blocs." So end today? "When I met PM Rudd I thanked helping catalyse thinking ASEAN. So two possibilities, either EAS expanded Russia US separate ASEAN plus eight (including US Russia) configuration. In fact I interesting discussion Prime Minister Rudd. I think end he's happy let ASEAN members decide doesn't want interfere regional discussion." So describe Yeo outlines either win loss Rudd. Whatever evolves, nobody going call Asia-Pacific Community one going imagine Rudd founder, everyone accepts Bob Hawke founded APEC 1989. On hand, seem though it's much likely finally regional organisation embracing everyone US India, able discuss security. That pretty much Rudd's policy aim and, Yeo constructively puts it, Rudd influenced ASEAN thinking. Friends Rudd describe embodiment vision fulfilment initiative. His enemies say APC came nothing failure Australian diplomacy. Certainly Yeo casts constructive light. There space give smallest sampling Yeo's prodigiously rich insights issues. On US, said: "Both Australia Singapore feel bones US remain great power many decades. It vast country always throwing new ideas, always boil. It sunny disposition. We Singapore Australia feel bones one way another get current difficulties." On China, I asked whether political development keeping pace growth power, financial military, could manage new power way beneficial everybody. Yeo stressed sure Beijing's preoccupations internal, said: "China No 1 trading partner Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, India already No 2 New Zealand, countries (in Asia) graph points direction." (The historical process) high drama China. It historically large rural peasantry Maoism developed different ideology Bolshevism. China 20 per cent urban. It's 40 per cent urban go 80 per cent 90 per cent. The urbanisation Europe languid comparison, look Dickens Victor Hugo. Look huge reaction Europe urbanisation industrialisation. In China it's compressed. If succeed greatest nation Earth. The Chinese know learn new tricks. The skills brought power won't keep power." He recalled early China's economic modernisation program fascinated Singapore, mostly Chinese nation, ran society orderly effective manner, combining rapid economic growth social order respect tradition. Then interest seemed wane. But Chinese delegations back large numbers, fascinated particularly Singapore manages politics big booming city. Mainland Chinese even sitting politicians' electoral clinics Singapore, observing real problems recognised, integrated system dealt with. I asked Yeo whether thought Japan could sustain stabilising role played Asia past 60 years. He replied: "Their politics mess. Partly fit pieces together closely, reconfiguring pieces is- difficult. A lot Japanese politics fitting pieces together pulling apart. "The DP1 came power determined pull pieces apart, Liberal Democratic Party big business bureacracy. Never write Japan off. It takes long time change change fury intensity surprises everyone." Japan gone profound periods change past - Meiji Restoration 19th century, decided become modern nation; pervasive change World War II, decided embrace democracy role key US ally region. The fact grappling change reason think cannot emerge successful model. Yeo old, old friend Australia, sense long-term champion Australia's involvement Southeast Asia. He minister Singapore government 20 years. He embodies great deal institutional memory strategic continuity, within Singapore within broader councils region. It's pity doesn't visit us bit often.

May 6, 2010, 6:11 amIt's Not About Greece AnymoreBy PETER BOONE AND SIMON JOHNSONLouisa Gouliamaki/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Protesters waved flags Acropolis archaeological site behind banners English Greek hung front Parthenon temple Athens.Peter Boone chairman charity Effective Intervention research associate Center Economic Performance London School Economics. He also principal Salute Capital Management Ltd. Simon Johnson, former chief economist International Monetary Fund, co-author "13 Bankers."The Greek "rescue" package announced last weekend dramatic, unprecedented far enough stabilize euro zone.The Greek government European Union leadership, prodded International Monetary Fund, finally becoming realistic dire economic situation Greece. They abandoned previous rounds optimistic forecasts admitted profoundly worse situation. This new program calls "fiscal adjustments" — cuts fiscal deficit, mostly spending cuts — totaling 11 percent gross domestic product 2010, 4.3 percent 2011, 2 percent 2012 2013. The total debt-to-G.D.P. ratio peaks 149 percent 2012-13 starting gentle glide path back sanity.This new program honest enough show unlikely succeed.Daniel Gros, eminent economist euro zone issues based Brussels, argued 1 percent G.D.P. decline Greek government spending, total demand country falls 2.5 percent G.D.P. If government reduces spending 15 percent G.D.P. — initial shock demand could well 30 percent G.D.P.Obviously simple rule work large numbers, illustrates Greece likely experience sharp recession — substantial uncertainty around bad economy get. The program announced last weekend assumes Greek G.D.P. falls 4 percent year, another 2.6 percent 2011, recovering positive growth 2012 beyond.Such figures seem extremely optimistic, particularly face civil unrest sweeping Greece deep hostility expressed toward Greece northern European policy circles.The pattern growth critical because, program, Greece needs grow debt problem soon. Greece's debt-to-G.D.P. ratio debilitating 145 percent end 2011.Now consider putting realistic growth figures I.M.F. forecast Greece's economy — e.g., G.D.P. declining 12 percent 2011, debt-to-G.D.P. ratio may reach 155 percent. At levels, 5 percent real interest rate growth, country needs primary surplus 8 percent G.D.P. keep debt-to- G.D.P. ratio stable. It nowhere near level. The I.M.F. program Greece running primary budget deficit around 1 percent G.D.P. year, assumes path Greek growth regarded "upside scenario."The politics implied budget surpluses remains brutal. Since Greek debt held abroad, roughly 80 percent budget savings Greek government makes go straight Germans, French foreign debt holders (mostly banks). If growth turns poorly, Greeks prepared ever-tougher austerity pay Germans? Even everything goes well, Greek citizens seem unlikely welcome version "new normal." Last week European leadership panicked — late day — realized euro zone risk meltdown. If euro zone proves unwilling protect member like Greece default, bond investors run Portugal Spain also — doubt this, study carefully interlocking debt picture published recently The New York Times. Higher yields government debt would caused concerns potential bank runs nations, spread nations Europe.When "run," clear stops. In hazy distance, Belgium, France, Austria many others potentially risk. Even Germans cannot afford bail nations.Slapped face ugly scenario, Europeans decided throw everything I.M.F. bailing Greece. The program announced small chance preventing eventual Greek bankruptcy, may still slow avert dangerous spiral downward — enormous collateral damage — rest Europe.The I.M.F. floated fashion alternative scenario debt restructuring, rejected European Union Greek authorities. This surprise; leading European policy makers completely unprepared broader problems would follow Greek "restructuring," markets would immediately mark debt (i.e., increase yields) Portugal, Spain, Ireland even Italy.The fear panic face would unparalleled modern times: When Greeks pay 50 percent face value debt, investors expect Portuguese Spanish? It becomes arbitrary, including countries dragged down.Someone decide defended cost, European structures completely unsuited kind tough decision-making pressurein extreme downside scenario, Germany obvious safe haven within euro zone, government bond yields would collapse governments face sharply rising yields. The euro zone would likely hold together.There still narrow escape path, without immediate debt default chaos would produce:- Talk euro — moving toward parity American dollar would help lift growth across euroz one.- As euro falls, bond yields rise euro zone periphery. This create episodes panic. Enough short-term financing must place support rollover government debt.. Once euro fallen great deal, announce European Central Bank support euro levels (i.e., prevent appreciation, G-20 tacit agreement), also support peripheral euro zone nations viewed solvent buying bonds whenever markets chaotic.• At stage, before, euro zone leadership needs push weaker governments restructure. That include Greece perhaps also Portugal. Hopefully, scenario Spain muddle through.• European banks recapitalized necessary management replaced. This massive failure euro groupthink — including notably political level — question bank executives behaved responsibly long replaced en masse.To extent possible, ensuing losses shared bank creditors. But careful wish for. The bankers powerful reason; built vital yet fragile structures heart economies. Dismantle care.

A number villagers including Madyam told volunteers smashed windows mirrors homes defaced family photographs crude drawings. Then lounged around furniture al-Arakib residents plain site owners. Finally, according Matyam, volunteers celebrated bulldozers destroyed homes. "What learned summer camp destruction," Madyam remarked, "is Israeli youth educated democracy, raised racism."

'This one days want throw hands say, 'What world doing?'" Senator Claire McCaskill, Missouri Democrat, said. "It's unconscionable," Carl Levin, senior Democratic senator Michigan, said. "The obstructionism become mindless." The Senators Capitol, sunk armchairs marble fireplace press lounge, directly behind Senate chamber. It four-thirty Wednesday afternoon. McCaskill, matching maroon jacket top, looked exasperated; Levin glowered spectacles. "Also, it's dumb rule itself," McCaskill said. "It's time started looking rules." She referring Senate Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5, requires unanimous consent committees subcommittees hold hearings two afternoon Senate session. Both Levin McCaskill scheduled hearings day two-thirty. Typically, wouldn't difficult get colleagues waive rule; general admiral flown halfway around world appear Levin's Armed Services Committee, McCaskill's Subcommittee Contracting Oversight Homeland Security Committee investigating training Afghan police. But March 24th, day President Barack Obama signed health-care-reform bill, victory ceremony White House; also day Senate vote reconciliation bill health-care reform, approved House three nights earlier, would retroactively remove new law's embarrassing sweetheart deals complete yearlong process passing universal health care. Republicans, fought bill bloc, mood make things easy. So, four hours earlier, Levin went Senate floor asked consent hold hearing, Senator Richard Burr, Republican North Carolina, member Levin's committee, refused. "I personal objection continuing," Burr said. But, added, "there objection side aisle. Therefore, I would object." Burr object behalf party Republican chamber Levin spoke. In general, senators give speeches floor, colleagues aren't around, two three might present aren't listening. They're joking aides, e-mailing Twitter ideas press secretaries, getting first look speech they're give eight unmanned cameras provide live feed C-SPAN2. The presiding officer Senate—freshmen majority party take rotating, hour-long shifts intended introduce ways institution—sits chair dais, scanning BlackBerry reading Times article Senate. Michael Bennet, freshman Democrat Colorado, said, "Sit watch us seven days—just watch floor. You know you'll see happening? Nothing. When I'm chair, I sit thinking, I wonder they're China right now?" Between speeches, quorum calls, time killers Senate clerk calls roll rate one name every minutes. The press gallery, dais, typically deserted, journalists prefer hunker press lounge, surfing Web analysis current Senate negotiations; television screens alert something interest actually happens chamber. The people pay attention speech Senate stenographers. On afternoon, two portly bald men suits stood facing speaker feet away, tapping transcription machines, resembled nineteenth-century cash registers, slung around necks. The Senate chamber intimate room men women go talk record. Like many aspects senatorial procedure, Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5 relic days senators hover around desks know happening floor main afternoon debate. (The desks, built long ago 1819, mahogany, lids lift up, like old schoolhouse; desks Majority Minority Leader still equipped brass spittoons.) In press lounge, McCaskill said, light sarcasm, "Somebody told rule make sure people pay attention what's happening floor debate distracted committee work. Clearly, it's old rule." The Republicans turned old rule new means obstruction. There would hearings afternoon; general admiral would come back another day. Like investment bankers Wall Street, senators days direct much creative energy toward manipulation arcane rules loopholes, scoring short-term successes magnifying institution's broader dysfunction. Around five o'clock, chamber began fill, reconciliation bill came vote; twenty-three amendments pending, Republicans, perhaps many come. Ordinarily, debate voting amendment might take two legislative days, rules reconciliation bill senators dispatch amendments one another, hot-dog-eating contest, minute debate side. The goal finish bill end evening, senators wouldn't miss day spring recess—apparently, thing worse government takeover health-care system. The usual longueurs Senate, forty minutes tick away antique clock rear double doors without word's spoken, yield frenzy. Harry Reid, Majority Leader, Nevada, predicted process, known Vote-O-Rama, would go past two morning, warned senators stay close chamber. Max Baucus, Montana, manager bill Democrats, rose said, "This first time recent memory reconciliation bill amendments one side only. These clearly amendments designed kill reconciliation and, therefore, kill health-care reform. So I much hope amendments defeated." Tall, gaunt Judd Gregg, New Hampshire, bill's Republican manager, took floor. "The position side aisle is: amendments allowed, even good," said. Indignation rouged cheeks, voice rose half octave. "Obviously, presume Republican Party inconvenience. The democratic process inconvenience. It also appears, considering opposition America, American people inconvenience." The Senate chamber laid four concentric semicircles, adjacent desks almost touching crowded Democratic side, desks much smaller Republican minority spaced loosely apart. The design meant emphasize senators' unity. But Baucus Gregg avoided eye contact across six feet aisle divides chamber two constantly warring factions. Senators required, custom, speak one another third person, directing anger sarcasm whichever poor freshman happens presiding officer moment. Rule XIX, Paragraphs 2 3—one original rules drawn Thomas Jefferson's "Manual Parliamentary Practice"—bars senators imputing unworthy conduct motives another senator, insulting senator's state. But rule finger-wagging, Baucus wagged Gregg shouting Al Franken, Minnesota, started shift presiding officer's chair: "Mr. President, make mistake, intent every single one amendments offered side aisle kill health-care reform. . . . A senator side aisle stood said hopefully President's Waterloo. They want kill health-care reform!" The voice Stuart Smalley filled chamber: "The time senator expired." For next nine hours, chamber became stage theatrical whose ending, like almost everything happens Senate floor, known advance all. The Republican goal Vote-O-Rama embarrass Democrats appearing suggest useful changes; Democratic goal prevent change bill, wouldn't return House, might voted down. Several Republican amendments designed make Democrats look hypocritical, forcing vote policies Party typically supports. One amendment, example, declared health-care bill could linked tax hike individuals making less two hundred thousand dollars year. Other amendments nakedly partisan, outlandish. David Vitter, Louisiana Republican, proposed amendment repealed entire law. Senator Tom Coburn, Republican obstetrician Oklahoma, introduced amendment insure veterans diagnosed mental illness would denied right firearms, another prevent "convicted child molesters, rapists, sex offenders" buying erectile-dysfunction drugs taxpayer funds. Coburn got minute allotted explain Viagra amendment without cracking smile. "This game amendment," insisted. "It actually saves money." So many senators snickered presiding officer banged gavel order. "The amendment offered senator Oklahoma makes mockery Senate," Baucus declared. "It crass political stunt aimed making thirty-second commercials, public policy." Baucus asked yeas nays, clerk called roll ragged pace. "Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins." Thirty-five-second pause. "Mr. Conrad, Mr. Corker." Ten seconds. "Mr. Cornyn." Senators pay attention sound name; cast votes they're inclined—wandering late, shuffling chamber's gentle blue-carpeted steps swarm colleagues milling well, clerks sit table, holding finger down. At one point, John McCain— one hundred senators struggling stay office—spent half minute waving stiff-armed, trying catch eye clerk could cast vote. In end, two Democrats—Evan Bayh, Indiana, Ben Nelson, Nebraska—joined Republicans opposing Viagra sex offenders. The amendment defeated. The carpeting chamber absorbs voices, long night one rose muffled drone Charles Schumer, said Gregg, "Get work! Stop screwing around health care!" Sporadically, sharp cackle emanated Al Franken, wandered chamber, looking Republicans could charm laughing. Observed press gallery, senators confined space began resemble zoo animals—Levin shambling brown bear, John Thune loping gazelle, Jim Bunning maddened grizzly. Each one displayed limited set behaviors: conversations, John Kerry planted inches away, loomed, clamped hands colleague's shoulders. Joe Lieberman patted everyone back. It became clear senators loners (Russ Feingold, Daniel Akaka) social (Blanche Lincoln, Lindsey Graham); senators important (Dick Durbin, Jon Kyl) ignored (Bayh, Bunning). Past midnight, Durbin slumped desk, one hand face, yawning painfully. Susan Collins going mail. Twenty-three amendments voted down, Republicans proposing fresh batch. "Can get order?" Bunning growled, introduced proposal let senior citizens opt parts Medicare. It amendment Republicans joined Democrats defeat. Harry Reid controls Senate's schedule, Mitch McConnell, Kentucky, Minority Leader, object. Since nearly everything Senate depends unanimous consent, main business place continuous negotiation two supremely unsentimental men. That night, played game chicken: McConnell, unsmiling, eyes riveted ahead, held prospect dozens amendments; Reid, former boxer, hunched mumbling, playing rope-a-dope, vowing fend amendments night. The two leaders left chamber confer privately proceed. Inside, atmosphere slumber party set in. Debbie Stabenow, Michigan, hand across heart, sang sentimental duet Robert Menendez, New Jersey. Exhaustion momentarily eased partisan divide. Claire McCaskill sat beside Tom Coburn, held erect finger face, casting Viagra vote, let go limp. Coburn could heard joke, "The longest lasted thirty seconds." At two-forty-five morning, Reid suddenly declared Senate adjourned. The Senate parliamentarian found two small violations reconciliation rules, meaning morning, despite Democrats' efforts, bill would go back House another vote. At bang gavel, senators fled. In parking lot, Capitol's northeast side, McCaskill climbed S.U.V. Levin, cramped sedan, chauffeured empty streets. On marble ledge near exit, Arlen Specter sat alone, ghost brown suit, staring straight ahead, waiting someone take away. The Senate reconvened 9:45 A.M. Around two afternoon, members gathered final vote, Democrats giddy. Tom Harkin, Iowa, Christopher Dodd, Connecticut, even exchanged hug. "Everyone's tired," Reid declared final vote. "This legislative fight one record books." He fatigued initially voted wrong way. Lindsey Graham came late, delaying tally ten minutes. "Way go, Lindsey, way stretch out," Sam Brownback told him. A Republicans lingered took moment, like players losing team end World Series. After year work, health-care reform passed, 56-43, moment chamber's Tweeting pygmies become legislative giants. The Senate often referred "the world's greatest deliberative body." Jeff Merkley, freshman Democrat Oregon, said, "That phrase I wince time I hear it, amount real deliberation, terms exchange ideas, limited." Merkley could remember witnessing one moment floor debate Republican Democrat. "The memory I took was: 'Wow, that's unusual—there's conversation occurring they're making point counterpoint challenging other.' And yet nobody else chamber." Tom Udall, freshman Democrat New Mexico, could recall seeing senator change another senator's mind. "You would really need good hour two extensive exchange among folks really know issue," said. Instead, senator typically gives "a prepared speech that's already vetted staff. Then another guy gets gives speech completely different subject." From time time, senators party carry colloquy—"I would interested distinguished senator Iowa's view side's Medicare Advantage plan"—that scripted advance aides. While senators Washington, days scheduled fifteen-minute intervals: staff meetings, interviews, visits lobbyists home-state groups, caucus lunches, committee hearings, briefing books, floor votes, fund-raisers. Each senator sits three four committees even subcommittees, meet morning hours, helps explain committee tables often nearly empty, senators drifting hearing barely sustain coherent line questioning. All activity crammed three-day week, it's unwritten rule modern Senate votes almost never scheduled Mondays Fridays, allows senators spend four days away capital. Senators now, unlike several decades ago, often keep families home states, return weekends, even it's Alaska Idaho—a concession endless fund-raising, populist anti-Washington mood recent years. (When Newt Gingrich became Speaker House, 1995, told new Republican members move families capital.) Tom Daschle, former Democratic leader, said, "When scheduled votes, day could absolutely certain one hundred senators Wednesday afternoon." Nothing dominates life senator raising money. Tom Harkin, Iowa Democrat, said, "Of free time have, I would say fifty per cent, maybe even more," spent fund-raising. In addition financing campaigns, senators participate least week Power Hour, make obligatory calls behalf Party (in Democrats' case, three-story town house across Constitution Avenue Senate office buildings, since they're barred using offices raise money). Lamar Alexander, Tennessee Republican, insisted donations never sufficient actually buy vote, added, "It sucks time senator ought spending getting know senators, working issues." In June, 2009, top aides Max Baucus, whose Finance Committee negotiating health-care-reform bill, took time meet two health-care lobbyists, former Baucus aides. (Baucus received million dollars industry 2008 reelection campaign.) That month, according Common Cause, industry groups spending $1.4 million day lobby members Congress. Udall, speaking corrosive effect fund-raising lobbying, said, "People know heart—they know place dominated special interests. The over-all bills nearly bold influence money." Deschle sketched portrait contemporary senator busy think: "Sometimes, you're dialling dollars, get call, you've got get vote, you've got fifteen minutes. You don't clue what's floor, staff whispering ears, you're running onto floor, check leader—you double check—but, make triple sure, there's little sheet paper clerk's table: The leader recommends aye vote, vote. So you've got checks make sure don't screw up, even screw sometimes. But, you're ever pressed, 'Why vote way?'—you walk thinking, Oh, God, I hope nobody asks, I don't clue." Aides, elbows senators shuttle offices Capitol, proliferated past decades, play crucial role. Lamar Alexander, office fifty people, pointed staff members, younger often ideological bosses, less dependent institutional relationships, tend push senators toward extremes. Often, aides main actors behind proposed legislation—writing bills, negotiating details—while senator relegated repeating talking points Fox' MSNBC. One day office, Udall picked tabloids coffee table waved me. "You know rags cover Hill, right?" said, smiling. There five dailies—Politico, The Hill, Roll Call, Con gressDaily, CQ Today—all emphasize insider conflict. The senators, like complain trivializing effect "24/7 media," provide end fodder it. The news day Udall called "dust-up" Scott Brown, freshman Massachusetts Republican, staffer Jim DeMint, arch-conservative South Carolina; staffer Tweeted Brown voting often Democrats, leading Brown confront DeMint Senate floor supposed breach protocol. Bloggers carry much influence many senators young press aide dedicated care feeding online media. News about, by, tiny kingdom political obsessives dominates attention senators staff, stories might affect constituents go unreported home-state papers longer afford bureaus Washington. Dodd, came Senate 1981 leave next January, told me, "I used eleven Connecticut newspaper reporters covered daily basis. I don't one today, haven't one number years. Instead, D.C. publications see prism conflict." Lamar Alexander described effect "this instant radicalizing positions left right." Both Alexander Gregg said Senate polarized rising number senators—now nearly fifty—who come House, rather governorships positions bipartisan coOperation still permissible. "A lot senators don't understand history tradition institution," Gregg said. "Substantive, thoughtful, moderate discussion pushed aside." Encumbered aides, prodded hourly jolts electronic media, racing hearing room caucus lunch Power Hour airport, senators longer time, perhaps inclination, get know one another—least all, members party. Friendships across party lines likely among spouses live Washington. After Udall joined Senate, last year, invited dinner Alexander, Jill Cooper Udall Honey Alexander become friends women's social club. It remains time Udall set foot house Republican senator. (Vice-President Joe Biden, autobiography, recalls that, seventies, bipartisan group senators wives hosted monthly dinner: "In days Democrats Republicans actually enjoyed other's company.") When I asked Chris Dodd well knew, example, Jim DeMint, Dodd said, "Not all. Whereas Jesse Helms I knew pretty well." He repeated something Jon Kyl, Republican whip, Arizona, recently said him: "There's trust." Dodd, whose father senator, went on, "That's really is—this place really operates that. I don't think anyone would argue conclusion. And that's missing. There remains veneer—badly chipped—of comity. On floor, senators still refer members opposing party "friends." Gregg described Kent Conrad, Democrat North Dakota, "one best friends Senate," Gregg Alexander ticked examples little-known legislation currently working Democrats; Alexander Ben Cardin, Maryland, introduced bill ban mountaintop-removal coal mining. Udall noted become friendly John McCain went congressional tour Iraq. But opportunities bond rare. On first floor Capitol, private dining room senators, "inner sanctum," Republicans Democrats used lunch (at separate tables, room). In seventies, old bulls James Eastland, Hubert Humphrey, Jacob Javits held court there; later, Daniel Patrick Moynihan did. "You learned, also found going on," Dodd said, adding, "It's awfully difficult say crappy things someone lunch with." These days, inner sanctum nearly always empty. Senators eat lunch respective caucus rooms members party, else "downtown," means asking donors money steak potatoes Monocle Charlie Palmer. The tradition "caucus lunch" instituted Republicans fifties, lost majority; Democrats, losing 1980, followed suit. Caucus lunches work members sides state pep-rally fervor. During one recent Republican lunch, Jim Bunning referred Harry Reid idiot. "At least courtesy behind closed doors," Alexander joked, adding, "We spend time team meetings deciding we're going other." In 2007, Alexander Lieberman started series bipartisan Tuesday breakfasts. "They kind dwindled health-care debate," Alexander said. Udall tried revive Wednesday inner-sanctum lunch. For first months, Democrats attended. Then, one Wednesday May, Susan Collins, Maine Republican, showed up, joking nervously turncoat; protect reputation, presence kept secret. These efforts resurrecting dead customs self-conscious and, probably, doomed get-togethers lovers try stay friends breakup. Ira Shapiro, Washington lawyer former aide Senator Gaylord Nelson, Wisconsin, put way: "Why would want lunch together hate other?" The upper chamber Congress constitutional compromise popular sovereignty state sovereignty. The Senate designed, part separation powers, check impulses House popular will. For Federalists, also aristocratic purpose: collect knowledge experience, guard levelling spirit might overtake majority. When Alexis de Tocqueville visited Senate, 1832, deeply impressed quality members: "They represent lofty thoughts [of nation] generous instincts animating it, petty passions." But also recognized "a minority nation dominating Senate could completely paralyze majority represented house, contrary spirit constitutional government." As long Senate continued composed America's talented statesmen, Tocqueville implied, would restrain anti-democratic potential. Robert A. Caro, "Master Senate," third volume life Lyndon Johnson, argues Civil War • Senate captured wealthy sectional interests, ending high-minded age Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun engaged brilliant debate. Aside spasms legislation start Presidencies Woodrow Wilson Franklin Roosevelt, Caro writes, Senate remained controlled alliance Southern racists Republican corporate shills, "the dam waves social reform dashed vain— chief obstructive force federal government." By fifties, Senate become far conservative public. And conservative: William S. White, 1956 book "Citadel," called Senate "to peculiar degree, Southern Institution . . . growing heart ostensibly national assembly" "the place country South lose war." By mid-century, become journalistic cliché call Senate broken. Otto Preminger's 1962 film "Advise Consent," based novel Allen Drury, Senate period, presents Democrats Republicans equally amoral, calculating, power-hungry. But institution, depicted Preminger, still works, way: though deals stink, get cut. The senators know colleagues rules; back-stab one another lunchroom, drink cocktails play cards Saturday nights. There lobbyists, fund-raisers, media, constituents—only senators' intricate relations one another. The Senate world. In memoir, Johnson's longtime aide Harry McPherson recalls learning Senate's "famous 'club' atmosphere based members' mutual acceptance responsibility concentration tasks hand. . . . They thrust hard one another debate serious matters," but, writes, "understanding accommodation ordinary course Senate day essential sanity." Johnson, powerful Majority Leader history, bent Senate forced become efficient. He saw colleagues either "whales"—the heavyweight chairmen negotiated legislation—or "minnows," followers went along brokered deals. And when, 1958, formidable new class liberal Democrats entered Senate—including Edmund Muskie, Eugene McCarthy, Philip Hart—the legislative machinery began produce reform. Michael Janeway, author "The Fall House Roosevelt," worked summer staff member 1958 1962. "They used talk other—that's vivid recollection," said. "If Wayne Morse talked constitutional law floor, Southerners would come hear him. The Hubert Humphrey farm policy. My strongest impression deliberative body, drawing out—sometimes pedantically." Senators ran office order work foreign policy, social welfare, urbanization win credibility whales. "But wanted something mechanism could it," Janeway said. In sixties seventies, Southern-conservative control broken coalition left-of-center Democrats moderate Republicans. Donald Ritchie, Senate historian, started working 1976, described Senate decades "a bipartisan liberal institution." The Civil Rights Act 1964 written largely office Republican Minority Leader, Everett Dirksen. Every major initiative—voting rights, open housing, environmental law, campaign reform—enjoyed bipartisan support. In rare event filibuster, motion end debate often filed jointly leaders parties. When Medicare—that government takeover health care elderly—was passed, 1965, won 70-24. The Senate's momentum nurtured superb talent: William Fulbright, Everett Dirksen, Henry Jackson, Frank Church, Howard Baker. In 1969, George McGovern chaired select committee hunger actually held bipartisan "field hearings" poor regions, calling witnesses migrant labor camps, then, Bob Dole's indispensable support, greatly expanded food-stamp program. The intensity senatorial purpose years must strike today's legislators profoundly humbling. After Joe Biden came Senate, 1973, Hubert Humphrey took aside said, "You pick issue becomes yours. That's attract colleagues follow you, Joe. That's demonstrate bona fides. Don't gadfly." Humphrey's career advice: "You become Mr. Housing. Housing future." The Senate's modern decline began 1978, election new wave anti-government conservatives, accelerated Republicans became majority 1981. "The Quayle generation came in, number people like Dan—same generation, hair style, beliefs," Gary Hart, Colorado Democrat, recalled. "They harder-line. They weren't get along Democrats. But look accommodationist compared Republicans Senate today." Church, McGovern, Javits, Birch Bayh gone. Ira Shapiro, former aide, writing book Senate sixties seventies, said, "It huge loss experienced, accomplished senators replaced neophytes. All sudden, 1981, half Senate less six years." He added, "The shattering great Senate long-term effects keep showing up. It gets worse time, never gets restored. There phrase I heard Helms younger ones: 'Others didn't want make waves; I wanted drain swamp.'" After C-SPAN went air, 1979, cozy atmosphere encouraged deliberation back-room deals began yield transparency and, it, posturing. "So Damn Much Money," recent book Washington Post reporter Robert G. Kaiser, traces spectacular rise Washington lobbying period. Liberal Republicans began disappear, Southern Democrats died replaced conservative Republicans. Bipartisan coalitions wings Senate vanished. The institutionalist gave way free agent, controlled fund-raising apparatus media presence, whose electoral base patchwork single-issue groups. Members parties—Howard Metzenbaum, Ohio Democrat; Jesse Helms, North Carolina Republican—took regularly using Senate's rules tie business narrowly ideological reasons. The number filibusters shot eighties continued rise following decades, parties kept alternating control Senate escalating procedural arms race, routinely blocking confirmation executive judicial appointees. Democrats filibustered Republican nominees bench; Republicans threatened ban filibuster cases—the so- called "nuclear option." Older members perturbed when, 2004, Republican Majority Leader, Bill Frist, went South Dakota campaign Democratic Minority Leader, Tom Daschle (who went lose). A years earlier, action would unthinkable. The weakened institution could longer withstand pressures outside walls; money cameras rushed in, independent minds fell line partisans. Rough parity two parties meant every election potential make break majority, crushing incentive cooperate across aisle. The Senate, longer fount ideas, became backwater U.S. government. During Clinton years, main action White House Gingrich House Representatives; Bush years, Republican Senate majority abdicated oversight role could placed vital check executive power. Norman Ornstein, congressional expert American Enterprise Institute, said Senate increasingly become populated "ideologues charlatans." He went on, "When get good people come in, quickly get ground dynamic culture parties. And get there, look takes stay there." He spoke Charles Grassley, Iowa Republican, who, nearing end career, spent much last year working closely friend Max Baucus health-care bill. Then, August, Grassley went home and, faced angry Republican voters prospect primary challenge right, started warning "pulling plug Grandma." Ornstein added similar pressures led John McCain begin "altering behavior abandoning every issue, including campaign-finance reform." One morning April, I visited Harry McPherson, former L.B.J. aide, offices legal lobbying firm D. L. A. Piper, downtown Washington. McPherson, eighty, desk firm's spiral-bound directory 111th Congress. I asked who, Johnsonian terms, whales current Senate. McPherson ran finger list senators. He again. "I'm trying here, looking remote descendant. Judas Priest, look this." He stumped. "Well, I see good people, I see people going get coalitions together time." He put directory aside. "I'm damnedest time." Down hall McPherson's office Mel Martinez, former Republican senator Florida; hired last year, two weeks resigning Senate seat without completing first term. (He since moved JPMorgan Chase.) William Cohen, former Maine senator Secretary Defense, office downstairs. Tom Daschle works D. L. A. Piper; predecessor Democratic leader, George Mitchell, firm's chairman, President Obama appointed Middle East envoy. One feature diminished U.S. senator ease moves legislating lobbying. Between 1998 2004, half senators left office became lobbyists. In 2007, Trent Lott, Republican leader Senate less year fourth term, abruptly resigned formed lobbying firm former Senator John Breaux, weeks new law took effect requiring two-year waiting period serving lobbying. When spend days Senate, it's easy forget everything else. The House Representatives seems miles away (it's corridor across rotunda), White House another country, actual foreign countries unimaginable. The place remains insular, labyrinthine, opaque—even physically. Senators commute thirty seconds offices chamber electric subway cars run along tunnel Constitution Avenue. Many signs misleading obsolete (the gilded lettering visitors' gallery says "Men's Gallery"), Capitol filled secret passageways spare rooms, called hideaways, doled according seniority, senators read, drink, doze, wait buzzer announcing imminent vote. The pervasive authority institution Constitution Bible but, rather, impenetrable sixteen-hundred-page tome, Floyd M. Riddick, called "Senate Procedure: Precedents Practices," late Robert Byrd, West Virginia, known read entirety. The procedures abstruse parliamentarian must sit presiding officer and, essentially, tell say. After half century, picture given Preminger's "Advise Consent" still faintly visible. "The Senate, nature, place consensus reigns personal relationships paramount," Lamar Alexander said. "And that's changed." Which exactly problem: it's self-governing body depends reasonableness members function. Sarah Binder, congressional scholar George Washington University, said, "To chamber rules unanimous consent—it's nutty! Especially you've got Jim Bunning please." In 2006 2008, sixteen Democrats entered Senate, giving Party current majority fifty-nine forty-one (counting two independents). They include moderates, like Jon Tester, Montana, Mark Warner, Virginia; liberals, like Sherrod Brown, Ohio, Sheldon Whitehouse, Rhode Island; policy specialists, like Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota, Jeff Merkley; iconoclasts, like Claire McCaskill. Their interest legislating won admiration senior senators. "If stay, I think they'll terrific," Chris Dodd said. "My worry won't stay. Because it's productive." The Democratic class 2008 arrived President Obama, expecting usher 6 dynamic new era. Instead, young Senate careers passed daily slog threatened filibusters "secret holds"—when senator anonymously objects bringing appointment vote, requires unanimous consent. On April 20th, Claire McCaskill took trouble read names fifty-six Obama nominees languishing limbo secret holds, Jon Kyl objected every one them. Just getting bill floor debate require days tactical gamesmanship party leaders. There times Warner wondered anyone ever quit first year. Michael Bennet said, "We find moment history questions huge ones, small ones, things put really long period time." He mentioned national debt, energy policy, financial crisis. "Yet Senate that's designed advance change slow it." We talking hideaway, windowless room Capitol basement, mini-fridge stocked bottled water, black leatherette furniture circa 1962, TV tuned C-SPAN2 mute; Senator Kyl's mouth moving. Bennet, former superintendent schools Denver, appointed vacant seat 2009, already defend year. He described Senate dry bluntness outsider hasn't allowed grow attached. Bennet repeated story heard. new congressman giving maiden speech: "And veteran guy came said, 'Son, you're talking like place level. It's level.' As fifteen months gone I've here, less level seems." Earlier year, Senate's procedural absurdities became national news twice one month. On February 4th, Con gressDaily reported Richard Shelby, Alabama Republican, secretly blocking confirmation seventy Obama appointees dispute involving defense earmarks his•state. (His tactics exposed, Shelby—whose office maintains responsible fewer fifty holds—lifted three.) Later month, Bunning spent several days late night Senate floor, filibustering prevent benefits paid millions unemployed Americans. When Merkley tried reason him, Bunning responded, "Tough shit." (Eventually, Republicans persuaded Bunning stop.) These incidents elicited brief outcry, extent Senate's routine folly remains largely hidden. For example, Grassley Ron Wyden, Oregon, trying since 1997 end practice secret holds, without success. In 2007, Senate passed bill banning secret holds last longer six days. But get around ban two senators pass hold back forth—it's called "rolling holds"—and party leader facilitates game keeping names secret. Many Senate's antique rules precedents warped beyond recognition modern pressures partisanship. The hold, example, courtesy extended senators days horse travel, needed time get back Washington read bill question appointee casting vote. Sarah Binder, co- authored book filibuster, calls procedure historical accident: 1806, Senate got rid little-used rule allowed "previous question" called vote. Suddenly, inherent limit debate, eighteen-thirties senators begun taking advantage loophole, derailing proceedings getting talking voice, legs, bladder gave out. (The word "filibuster' comes vrijbuiter—old Dutch "looter.") In 1917, Woodrow Wilson, wartime legislative agenda blocked filibusters, forced Senate pass Rule XXII, allowed two-thirds majority bring floor debate end "cloture" vote. For decades, rule rarely used; 1919 1971, forty-nine cloture votes, fewer one per year. In seventies eighties, annual average rose dozen. (Frustration increase led Senate, 1975, lower threshold cloture sixty votes.) In nineties early aughts, average went twenty-five thirty year, parties escalated use filibuster found minority. After Republicans lost majority 2006, filibusters became everyday events: hundred twelve cloture votes 2007 2008, session Republicans target break filibuster record. The tally cloture votes reflects small fraction senatorial obstruction. Three hundred forty-five bills passed House prevented even coming debate Senate. "Why?" Steny Hoyer, outraged Democratic Majority Leader House, asked me. "Because business way facilitates noncontroversial things. Thankfully, House Representatives becoming Senate." Last week, six House Democrats expressed displeasure upper chamber staging sit-in sorts Senate floor. Seventy-six nominees judgeships executive posts approved committees but, blocks, haven't come vote full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle jobs unfilled across upper levels Obama Administration. (The Democrats also practiced art blocking nominees Bush Administration.) There's often objection individual blocked: eight-month hold, Martha Johnson, nominated run General Services Administration, confirmed 96-0. On issue like health-care reform, objection substantive, Republicans ransacked Riddick's "Senate Procedure" every conceivable way delay debate vote. Judd Gregg even sent memo stalling tactics Republican colleagues. Tom Coburn demanded reading aloud entire seven-hundred-and-sixty-seven-page amendment proposed Bernie Sanders, Vermont socialist; Senate clerks, working half-hour shifts, three hours chore Sanders withdrew amendment frustration. Under McConnell, Republicans consistently consumed much Senate's calendar possible legislative maneuvering. The strategy extend deliberation Senate's agenda prevent it. Tom Harkin, first proposed reform filibuster 1995, called Republican colleagues "nihilists," want create chaos serves ideology. "If there's chaos, things tend toward simple solutions," Harkin said. "In chaos people don't listen reason." McConnell respond requests interview, often argued Republican strategy reflects views majority Americans. In March, told Times, "To extent they"—the Democrats— "want things think political center would helpful country, we'll helpful. To extent trying turn us Western European country, going helpful." One mysteries Senate Mitch McConnell able keep members line, vote vote. Why moderates years experience power base back home—Richard Lugar, Indiana; Susan Collins, Maine; George Voinovich, Ohio—keep siding extreme members caucus? Alexander said McConnell listens well members, adding, "When back wall gallows hanging front you, tends unify. Operating forty members—it concentrates mind." Lindsey Graham described Times McConnell exhorted caucus disastrous 2008 election: "He said didn't stick together big things, wouldn't relevant." Last December, Republicans decided filibuster military-spending bill order delay looming vote health care close Christmas possible. Thad Cochran, Republican ranking member Appropriations Committee, promised Daniel Inouye, chairman, wouldn't join effort. But last minute Cochran, Senate since 1979 brings disproportionate amounts defense money Mississippi, told Reid leadership wouldn't allow vote Democrats end filibuster—even matter national security. (The Democrats able impose cloture, vote health care finally took place Christmas Eve.) Republican defections rare. In early 2009, Collins Olympia Snowe, also Maine, voted stimulus bill, along Arlen Specter (who promptly switched parties). Snowe also voted Finance Committee's health-care- reform bill last October, Republican so. But December, pivotal moment, voted version went full Senate. "I wasn't interested expanding program beyond Finance Committee version—it grew thousand pages," Snowe said. She wasn't included negotiations White House officials took place elegant conference room across Reid's suite offices, said Democrats "did accept proposals. As I said President, windup pitch." McConnell able exploit alienation. A friend Snowe cited another reason reversal: "She actually said never felt pressure felt health care, never pressure quite evident quite real troubling. Kyl McConnell saying things like 'You can't let us down, we're together. You're senior Republican member caucus, hang tough us. We expect you're going it.' " Reid doesn't use tough tactics; achieved position, spite public shortcomings, senator helped Democrats, always answered calls, got wanted masterly maneuvering. This made enormously popular within Democratic caucus, doesn't give leverage McConnell, let alone Lyndon Johnson. In current Senate, become normal handful senators, sometimes representing ten twenty per cent country's population, hold everything up. And status quo become sufficiently frustrating new senators considered radical option: mutiny. Tom Udall, sixty-two, older freshman senators. He crow's-feet Westerner spent time sun, slow, good-natured voice. His father, Stewart, Arizona congressman Interior Secretary Presidents Kennedy Johnson; uncle Mo legendary Arizona representative; cousin Mark freshman senator Colorado. Udall served five terms House winning Senate seat New Mexico, 2008. And yet air political Candide—he always earnest, capable disappointment cynicism. "I ran idea Senate graveyard good ideas," said. "Then inside—the thing strikes one senator hold whole show." In first year office, Udall decided something audacious: would try change Senate's rules. Customarily, rules continue session session, provision Rule XXII requires sixty-seven votes amend them, making extremely difficult. ("Rule XXII Catch-22," Ted Kennedy used joke.) Udall embraced different idea—the "constitutional option." Article I, Section 5 Constitution states "each House may determine Rules Proceedings" beginning new Congress. So, theory, senator could take floor next January propose debating rules scratch, including filibuster. New rules could passed simple majority. There's even precedent this: moves revisit rules invoking constitutional option made three times, recently 1975. Udall spent much past year trying build support idea. At request Udall others, Schumer, chairman Rules Committee, held series hearings filibuster, calling witnesses Sarah Binder, historian, Walter Mondale, Senate constitutional option invoked 1975. Dick Durbin, second-highest-ranking Democrat, organized working groups among newer members internal reforms, ending secret holds choosing committee chairs caucus vote rather seniority. (Lamar Alexander wryly suggested Schumer Durbin competing favor newer members, case Harry Reid loses seat fall run Majority Leader.) For Republican institutionalists, Alexander Gregg, push rules reform folly. "If want parliamentary form government, go House," Gregg, retire, scoffed. "Why even run Senate?" Udall's plan next January, said, would "gigantic mistake." "They'll get it," Alexander said Democrats' enthusiasm rules reform. "And they'll get quicker they're minority next January. Because they'll instantly see value slowing Senate consider whatever say." He added Senate "may getting done much American people want done." The President's ambitious agenda, all, upset lot voters, across political spectrum. None Republicans I spoke agreed contention Senate "broken." Alexander claimed Republicans exercising moderating, thoughtful influence legislation founders wanted Senate. "The Senate wasn't created efficient," argued. "It created inefficient." At one filibuster hearings, April, Alexander, sitting across table Udall, said that, times Democrats charge Republicans obstructing legislation, "we could say that's number times majority tried cut right debate, right offer amendments, essence Senate." Newcomers like Udall seem think Senate grown absurd extreme kind reform inevitable. Perhaps need time plumb depths institution's intransigence. According Sarah Binder, change rules extremely unlikely; Republicans would implacably opposed to, say, weakening filibuster, would Democrats, especially long-serving ones. "I would oppose that," Chris Dodd said, adding freshmen, "These people never minority." For older Democrats, put years, grown adept working rules, chair powerful committees, reform impulse could threat. (Among senior senators, sole enthusiast rules reform Tom Harkin.) One senator spoke Senate divided whales minnows but, rather, bulls calves. The older Democrats accustomed Senate's ways share frustrations newcomers; handful older moderate Republicans weak challenge newer radicals dominate caucus. Even freshmen Democrats somehow reform filibuster next January, Senate remain sclerotic, wasteful, unhappy body. The deepest source problems rules precedents but, rather, human beings, created culture Tocqueville's "lofty thoughts" "generous impulses" place. A days passing health-care reform, Senate struggled feet take second large task. Financial regulatory reform easiest piece major legislation Obama Presidency, likeliest win real bipartisan support. The financial crisis catastrophic millions Americans, 2008 bailout Wall Street become even hated Senate was. In April, lineup bankers Goldman Sachs appeared Senator Levin's subcommittee investigations, managed appear arrogant, callous, evasive reputations suggested. The public demanded action. Some Republicans genuine desire pass bill. If health-care reform war attrition, financial reform promising liaison. The affair began Republican, Bob Corker, Democrat, Mark Warner—both multimillionaires serving first term, considered centrists. Corker small, dapper former construction magnate became mayor Chattanooga; Warner tall, preppily dressed former telecommunications entrepreneur became governor Virginia. Chris Dodd, Banking Committee chairman, assigned work together section bill liquidation troubled firms—making sure would never another taxpayer bailout. They worked winter, Warner's office, Corker's office, dinner, sometimes without staff, members Senate past. They hosted series afternoon seminars, inviting guests Ben Bernanke, Alan Greenspan, Sheila Bair. Corker Warner sometimes said Democrat Republican still talking other. In January, Business Week called Senate's "Odd Couple." By February, finished work. Meanwhile, discussions entire bill Dodd Richard Shelby, top Republican committee, dragged on, repeatedly breaking down. Finally, February 10th, Dodd called Corker, who, though one committee's junior members, agreed chairman's Republican negotiating partner. When Corker informed McConnell Shelby, expressed surprise. "It odd place be," Corker recalled. "And yet night began meeting." The junior Republican savored rare experience creating, rather opposing, legislation. In response, Shelby's conservative staff tried undermine Corker, spreading rumors among Republicans lobbyists giving much away. (A Shelby aide said staff members simply informing Republicans Party's line financial reform.) On March 10th, Dodd concluded move bill floor. He called Corker said, "You've great partner." He ending talks month. "It's little stunning, I've got honest," Corker told reporters afterward. Someone close negotiations compared Corker Dickens's Miss Havisham, unable get rebuff, forever awaiting arrival groom, clocks stopped. Corker later said Dodd ended talks pressure White House Democrats. Dodd said Corker unable bring Republicans him. "Baloney," Corker said. "If Dodd reached agreement me, we'd've least twenty- five Republican votes." The bill Dodd brought Senate, year discussions Democrats Republicans alike, incorporated bipartisan plan Warner Corker prevent another bank bailout: setting fifty-billion-dollar fund, paid banks, insure orderly liquidation, establishing risk council detect warning signs another crisis. But mid-April Mitch McConnell—who met Wall Street executives New York, parroting talking points memo written Republican strategist Frank Luntz—called "partisan bill" "will guarantee perpetual taxpayer bailout Wall Street banks." McConnell presented letter, signed forty-one Republicans, suggesting would filibuster financial-reform bill. His remarks amounted repudiation Corker's work well Dodd's. The next day, April 15th, Corker pleaded colleagues, Tennessee twang, "Let's come floor let's act like adults. Let's tone rhetoric. Let's don't exaggerate pluses minuses. Let's Senate created do. . . . We supposed people took red-hot activities sometimes come body sat cooler heads resolved issues like adults. We that. As matter fact, I would say, cannot financial regulation, issue really doesn't real philosophical bearings . . ." Corker didn't allow thought ripen—he already gone farther almost Republican would dared. Dodd spoke later day completed Corker's speech: "I know friends side aisle faced difficult choice supporting party leadership participating complicated, difficult debate. I naïve. I know hard place be. But can't act like U.S. senators sake issue . . . even here?" He went on, "We work American public sick tired feeling like one looking interests, like political hacks lobbyists hold cards discussions. The minority seems intent proving right. . . . I long time. I know institution better that. I know friends mine side aisle care bill, want part debate, want part solution." In speech, Dodd joined partisan fight, accusing McConnell lying bill. Turning crimson-faced, chopped air hand shouted, "I ask myself, I go process last four five months, agreeing much offering, single political vote show it. . . . I say younger members, newer members coming along: careful!" Corker, heard Dodd speaking, returned chamber asked respond. "You I went long way," Corker told Dodd. "Then stopped. On March 10th ended. I understand that, look, losing Democrats committee." "And I gaining Republicans," Dodd replied. "You one, asked started. I never said I could speak anybody myself. And I leave table." Corker urged Dodd keep talking Republicans—their differences could sorted days. But McConnell's agenda. Instead, financial reform became slightly polite repeat health-care- reform brawl: Republicans threatened filibusters, Democrats threatened all-nighters, thousands lobbyists prowled Capitol, charging Wall Street clients billion dollars. On April 28th, I sitting ornate Reception Room Jim Manley, Reid's spokesman. On side wall, noise furniture scraping across tile floor. "Those cots set L.B.J. Room," Manley said. "Very little happens around without deadline." The cots persuaded Republicans allow bill move floor debate. A weeks later, May 20th, yet another filibuster defeated yet another cloture motion, financial reform finally came vote. It passed, 59-39. Only four Republicans joined majority. Corker wasn't among them. He even voted amendment, offered Republican colleague Jeff Sessions, Alabama, would scrapped Corker's work many months Warner. "The idea watching Bob Corker vote Sessions amendment!" Dodd said afterward, sitting red-curtained office, print Holbein's portrait Thomas More. "It's Senate, I guess." McConnell's strategy obstruction come close succeeding, Dodd said, knew "shrinking number" Republicans frustrated. The previous day, Dodd said Susan Collins, "God, I would loved ranking member this." Collins responded, "We could great time bill." Warner, said believed bipartisanship "the American people don't trust either political party enough give blank check," astonished Republicans voted financial reform. "There zero substantive reason couldn't eighty votes," said. I asked Bob Corker voted bill. Warner started talk consumer-protection title, said, "If want vote something, always find reasons." But Corker hadn't seemed want vote it. He spent months trying act like U.S. senator, alienating party party, day vote held floor better part thirty minutes, still reluctant let effort go. "I obviously disappointed," said. "I think I spent much time senator. . . policy regarding financial system. I think bill—even bill—has good things it. There question. And I appreciate thrust. But I think lot overreaching, I think enough time spent core issues." As senators cast votes, I noticed Robert Kaiser, author "So Damn Much Money," press gallery. I later asked if, passage two big reform bills three months, witnessing possible renewal Senate. "If engage public opinion way politicians understand, public opinion still blow away money interest groups," said. "But past decades reflex grown Senate that, things considered, it's better avoid take big issues. This kind thing drives Michael Bennet nutty: you've arrived United States Senate can't fuck-all destruction planet." After final vote financial reform, Republicans flew home, Democratic leaders held press conference, smiling microphones outside Senate chamber. Reid said, "For wanted protect Wall Street, didn't work." He excused himself: join Biden telephone fund-raiser "some Nevadans." Durbin said, "I stunned four Republicans would join us passing historic legislation. What take bring Republican Party conversation future America?" Dodd, glowing triumph, said, "I wanted demonstrate Senate United States could conduct business much founders intended. We that." On July 21st, President Obama signed completed bill. The two lasting achievements Senate, financial regulation health care, required year half legislative warfare nearly destroyed body. They depended set circumstances—a large majority Democrats, charismatic President electoral mandate, national crisis—that last long repeated anytime soon. Two days financial reform became law, Harry Reid announced Senate would take comprehensive energy-reform legislation rest year. And climate change joined immigration, job creation, food safety, pilot training, veterans' care, campaign finance, transportation security, labor law, mine safety, wildfire management, scores executive judicial appointments list matters world's greatest deliberative body incapable addressing. Already, feel Senate slipping back stagnant waters.

How Come havent? This against. Betrayed They said save Afghanistan's women. So come haven't? BY VALERIE M. HUDSON, PATRICIA LEIDL I MAY 10, 2010 One day November 2009, Helmand province's capital Lashkar Gah, group Afghan widows divorcees met Patricia, commissioned write series success stories U.S. Agency International Development (USAID). All women 20s, 30s, 40s looked 60s. Until recently, none could work possessed marketable skills, could neither read write, risk killed left homes. A number women said that, program -- focused tailoring basic literacy -- children used weep night hunger. COMMENTS (22) SHARE: Twitter Reddit Buzz EMore... As Patricia prepared leave, women fluttered around like moths, touching sleeves speaking once. 'What saying?" Pat asked young Pashto-speaking interpreter. "They telling go back country ask people abandon them. The women Afghanistan don't want leave. They quite literally die Taliban return," said. In recent question-and-answer period one universities, Brigham Young, student asked Gen. David Petraeus whether anyone thought ask women Afghanistan felt U.S. hopes incorporate "reformed" Taliban governance structures Americans leave. Carefully avoiding word "women," general assured questioning student "moderate" Taliban would eligible rehabilitation. Left unaddressed definition "moderate," clearly depends sit: If sit burqa, thing "moderate" Taliban. Petraeus might find easy sidestep question happen Afghanistan's women "moderate" Taliban come back, it's likely haunt long time. Without security women security -- we've done protect it, moral practical obligation stay Afghanistan. In 2001, George W. Bush's administration interpreted first post-invasion photos Afghan girls heading school Afghan women unveiling faces tangible evidence conditions improving benighted land. A months invasion, 2002 State Union address, Bush announced, "The last time met chamber, mothers daughters Afghanistan captives homes, forbidden working going school. Today women free part Afghanistan's new government." The Americans strong-armed handful women loya jirga drafted Afghan Constitution. They strong-armed quota women Afghan national legislature -- something even American women treated to. U.S. troops built schools girls pushed women included local shuras, USAID ripped page Greg Mortenson's Three Cups Tea facilitated new training educational opportunities women. But current administration, despite female secretary State new Office Global Women's Issues, appears ditching women Afghanistan like blind date gone bad. You go back 10 months find sustained rhetoric President Barack Obama importance assuring security women Afghanistan. Since then, especially since last year's Afghan election, fine words sitting president disappeared. Many fine actions gone, too. Push local shuras including women 2002? Yes. Push local shuras including women 2010? Forget it. It's difficult understand why. Afghanistan crisis. The cynical policies characterized early mid-stages occupation come home roost. President Hamid Karzai rogue's gallery kleptocrats, human rights abusers, drug lords hanging onto power even Karzai declares open season United Nations accusing senior bureaucrats organizing widespread voter fraud consolidated hold power. In meantime, women taken back seat realpolitik exigencies coalition exit strategy. But suffering real, Afghanistan's poverty chaos affect women possibly all. Matemal mortality Afghanistan still makes world's top three list, nine years U.S. invasion, resulting life expectancy women 46. In countryside, Taliban zealots spray acid girls' faces going school -- 27 percent first place. According recent survey U.N. Development Fund Women, 87 percent Afghan women report beaten regular basis. In July last year, U.N. Assistance Mission Afghanistan (UNAMA) issued report represents stinging official condemnation Karzai administration's abysmal track record women date. The report concluded, "The current reality ... women denied fundamental human rights risk violence course seeking justice crimes perpetrated them." Last year Karzai pardoned well-connected political thugs -- witnesses -- gang-raped woman bayonet. Her husband, battled redress, assassinated soon thereafter. Women dare speak widespread trampling rights face almost certain death murderers face 100 percent impunity. For warlords mujahideen make upper echelons Karzai government, issue gender equality always unwanted appendage U.S. involvement -- one could easily dispensed deployment flowery speeches token appointment lone female minister Ministry Women's Affairs. Indeed, recent "election," Karzai felt secure enough sign law series repressive measures designed repeal minimal gains women made since Taliban ouster. Although eventually forced back legislation allows Shiite husbands rape wives, Karzai successfully signed law legislation denies severely limits women's rights inherit, divorce, guardianship children. The Shiite Personal Status Law also legalizes forced marriage rape minors. It allows men exert almost total control female relatives offers power prohibit women's access work, education, health care denying right leave homes except "legitimate" purposes. Even Karzai's wife -- doctor whose skills desperately needed -- strictly sequestered. And sounds bad, wait Americans leave. This women. Gender inequality affects girls women, boys men. In Afghanistan, women rarely able leave house, young boys often forced carry unwarranted amount financial responsibility, something limits prospects well. Nor even Afghanistan. As Secretary State Hillary Clinton said March, "The subjugation women threat national security United States." On geopolitical level, Valerie's research found states higher levels violence women also less peaceful internationally. Indeed, violence women better predictor bellicosity level democracy, level wealth, presence Islamic civilization. In 2010 study, Valerie, along Brad Thayer, also found high levels gender inequality strong aggravating factor development Islamic suicide terrorism. So, given desperate need Afghanistan's women serious consequences worldwide, aren't help? One reason fallacious notion, common among coalition members, Afghan "culture" allow gender equality forcing issue undermine Western interests. Pat heard openly one coalition representative, prefers remain anonymous: 'There point pushing gender equality. It alienate [Afghans]." Of course, "them" refers men. But decision-makers forget culture fixed, highly mutable dynamic. More 30 years ago, Afghan women attending universities, teaching, working doctors, nurses, professors. Far black hole gender apartheid, Afghanistan, though impoverished, progressive many Muslim neighbors. Furthermore, many young Afghans open new ways things. In 2009, hundreds Afghan men women bravely stood together Kabul protest Karzai's support new oppressive Shiite family law. If Americans assume Afghan men Neanderthals incapable sympathizing plight sisters, wrong. Another, unmentionable reason may chauvinism permeates Western military culture. U.S. military life, despite increasing female recruitment even "female engagement teams," remains bastion masculinity, little sensitivity toward questions female rights. For military leadership recruits alike, immured almost exclusively male world, complete absence women Afghanistan's streets villages elicited comment Marines surrounded Pat, though woman noticed immediately. And ready availability pornography U.S. bases, coupled seamier depictions life West, damages prospects gender equality extension, Western interests. As one young, well-educated 24-year-old Afghan male pointed out, "Your culture respect women all. Look pornography way exploit women ways can't even imagine. Do call progress?" Added another Afghan USAID programmer working Gardez, man 50s father three girls, "It would better coalition could figure way limit kind material." We better -- much better. The Obama administration must instill military personnel senior diplomats necessity fully protecting women's rights. Key educating gender equality furthers Western interests security. The military spend less time courting "moderate" Taliban time showing Afghan community leaders gender equality -- including female access family planning methods -- result healthier families, lower maternal child death rates, poverty alleviation, greater self-determination. Gender included component governance training placed front center upcoming "peace jirga" include Taliban. Indeed, let half negotiating team representing government coalition female: yes, full 50 percent. Women must also represented government. As Melanne Verveer, U.S. ambassador large global women's issues, noted last summer, speaking female politicians Afghanistan, "There one minister cabinet, powerless. There low percentage women civil service. There one female governor, Bamiyan." Obama must insist important changes women leave make subsequent aid contingent upon maintenance strong presence women Afghan government. Better yet, coalition needs support "regime change" building democratic institutions groom moderate, educated middle class young women men eventually take over. Over two-thirds Afghan population age 25, either real opportunity social change -- educated given chance shape society progressive way -- major obstacle, find without jobs, unable marry, burdened retrograde attitudes means male female. We must hold Afghanistan responsible treaty obligations U.N. Convention Elimination Discrimination Women (CEDAVV) U.N. Security Council Resolution 1325 women, peace, security. Afghanistan signed CEDAW without reservations (the United States interestingly, not), means committed passing whatever legislation necessary implement wide-ranging principles gender equality enshrined treaty. This includes taking measures ensure women enjoy basic human rights fundamental freedoms men, place legal judicial procedures protect rights women, taking measures eliminate sexist discrimination, lastly, submitting national reports every four years U.N. advisory group international experts, CEDAW Committee, ensure transparency measures country taken implement treaty's provisions. Unanimously adopted 2000, UNSC 1325 marked first time Security Council recognized disproportionate unique impact armed conflict women stressed importance equal full participation active agents peace security. Needless say, women currently enjoy fundamental freedoms men, indeed, passing Shiite family law, many worse before. To change this, coalition needs stay Afghanistan. Withdrawing critical juncture would doom Afghanistan entire region instability effectively consign one half population premature death existence fit animals. We creating shameful American tradition leaving women better (Afghanistan) -- even much worse (Iraq) -- U.S. troops intervened. On basis America's track record, women around world faith U.S. soldiers improve security. Despite Clinton's remarks link gender equality security, ground Americans act women's well-being, end, peripherally related issue peace. As seen, view could wrong. Verveer's benchmarks concerning Afghanistan right ones: "Progress Afghanistan must measured military terms, also terms social, political, economic participation women rebuilding Afghanistan safeguarding human rights." American women right ask sending sons daughters fight die Afghan women continue treated like inferior subspecies humanity. When break faith Afghan women, break faith American women. You also break faith reasons first place. Save bio subscribe FP. Majid Saeedi/Getty Image

Under-Skin Defibrillators Seen Closer Reality By BARRY MEIER The likelihood patients United States may day receive heart defibrillators operate without electrical wires connected hearts moved step closer, according study published Wednesday. The development new type defibrillator long pursued researcher, Dr. Gust H. Bardy, Seattle Institute Cardiac Research Seattle. And study The New England Journal Medicine, Dr. Bardy researchers reported initial trials device patients successful. Defibrillators fire electrical jolt interrupt potentially fatal heart rhythm restore normal beating. For unit function, surgeon must thread electrical sensing wire blood vessel patient's heart. The wires pose risks can, rare occasion, puncture heart implantation fracture place. The new version delivers electrical jolt means sensor implanted skin near chest bone. A power unit placed skin side chest. The new device already sale European countries, Dr. Bardy others cautioned full-scale, long- term trials still needed prove implant's worth Food Drug Administration. Even successful, unit could used patients needed defibrillator, several researchers said excited new study nonetheless. Dr. Douglas P. Zipes, professor Indiana University School Medicine Indianapolis, said new device could someday displace existing models used many patients Every month, 10,000 patients country get defibrillator, either first time replacements devices whose batteries worn out. In recent years, safety defibrillator wires come particular focus model made Medtronic prone fracturing. Hundreds patients received model undergo new operations replace it. Also, scar tissue often builds around intravenous wires, process make removing replacing difficult dangerous. Dr. Bardy said telephone interview deaths several patients many years ago wire-related injuries factor interest developing new device. "You looking therapy avert, hope, complications effective," said. In study published Wednesday, Dr. Bardy others reported new device undergone several successful initial trials, including one used year 60 patients. The device developed Cameron Health, small company San Clemente, Calif., co-founded Dr. Bardy. Since cardiologist began work project decade ago, defibrillator helped design gone several iterations. The device suitable significant number heart patients, particularly require units also include pacemaker, regulates heart beating fast slowly. But Dr. Bardy estimated device could work 25 percent patients get defibrillator. These largely patients risk, genetic factors certain types heart diseases, type erratic cardiac rhythm cause sudden death. Dr. Bardy said cost new device standard defibrillator. However, said could help reduce health care costs, implanting much simpler. Before device sold here, Cameron Health submit extensive human trial data theF.D.A.. Dr. Bardy said larger study device begun country overseas likely take year assemble data agency's review.
August 8, 2010 Gary Sick America Iran: Strikes, Sanctions Scapegoats For pundits, two questions U.S.-Iran relations importance: (1) Will Israel and/or United States attack Iran? (2) new sanctions enough bite persuade Iran change nuclear policy? Despite printers ink spilled two issues, answers easy no. Neither United States Israel take military option table, thereby giving pundits (and crowd dying repeat Iraq) latitude keep distant prospect military action front pages, years. As lede, sells columns newspapers, go away. But analysis either blinded momentary hype else simple wish fulfillment. Uber-neocon John Bolton right. If attack occur, would end Bush administration nothing left lose. Bolton thought inevitable predicted unequivocally Wall Street Journal column 2008. Dick Cheney apparently agreed, judging subsequent statements regret. So fair say George W. Bush, looking potential consequences, resisted advice neocon advisers, previously dominant vice president, reported direct request government Israel — rejected strike. What likelihood Barack Obama, catastrophic scenario him, approve? Forget it. Sanctions persuade dictatorial regimes abandon projects think central security survival even self-image. Just look Saddam Hussein. The international sanctions imposed Iraq 1980s make current Iran sanctions appear anemic comparison. Every item went Iraq subject approval UN committee dominated vindictive United States. Yet, although Iraq abandoned nuclear weapons program years earlier, Saddam could bring let people enemies know that. Instead prepared gamble United States would attack him. One reasons bad bet cronies well sanctions immediate necessity come clean. They, all, controlled smuggling routes. And henchmen managed thriving enormously lucrative black market. As concern people, rotund Tariq Aziz, sitting fine Scotch Cuban cigar, informed worried UN representative would good Iraqi people lose weight. An Iraqi friend mine told time sanctions made criminals entire Iraqi middle class, resort illegal behavior order survive. The biggest – successful – new criminal class privileged group immediately around Saddam Hussein. Which brings us Iran. The sanctions effective many anticipated. They built web financial restrictions limitations around already weak Iranian economy certain cause significant problems leadership. Iran's critical energy sector particularly vulnerable. It pincer. Because cheap energy prices inside country, artificially propped massive subsidies, energy demand soaring. This siphons lot Iran's oil production, would otherwise sold world market hard currency. At time, Iran's oil fields old complex, require modern technology maintain production. That technology – capital investment provided major international oil companies – absent many years. It driven away partly sanctions, ironically assisted Iran's short-sighted negotiating tactics offered meager profit margins outside investors. As result, Iran's oil production decline time soaked domestic consumption. In period relatively low oil prices, means Iran's hard currency earnings drying alarming rate. This unenviable economic situation compounded described perhaps least competent economic management team major country world. Ayatollah Khamene'i, Supreme Leader, seems totally preoccupied bolstering shaky political legitimacy pandering Revolutionary Guards surround protect him. The result corruption scale beyond anything shah's regime could imagined. President Ahmadinejad, also creature Revolutionary Guards, free indulge taste outlandish irresponsible rhetoric. His words keep international domestic spotlight glued him; effect drives away prospective investors facilitates U.S. drive enlist international support sanctions Iran. An American Jewish leader joked suspected Ahmadinejad Mossad agent: one, observed, helpful promoting donations Israel Israeli causes. At time, leadership Iran inflation unemployment double digits. But fair, Ahmadinejad first politician modern Iranian history willing address "third rail" Iranian politics — immensely costly subsidies food energy. His initial efforts reduce amount subsidized gasoline Iranians could use met outbursts indignation, including torching filling stations. But rules seem grudgingly accepted eased slightly Iran's energy dilemma. He addressing low tax rates assessed merchants. This also resulted outrage, including closing bazaars Iran major cities. But campaign seems making progress. These needed reforms would recommended responsible economic overseer, including International Monetary Fund. Ahmadinejad attempts balance daring assaults entrenched economic interests belligerent rhetoric, always casting champion little guy. In resembles populist predecessors, Juan Peron Huey Long Hugo Chavez. Ahmadinejad takes America Israel way Governor Long took Standard Oil. But like populists, Ahmadinejad prisoner eccentric view world loyalty lieutenants may may worthy faith them. The key question Iran today whether attacked collapse sanctions. It whether Iran capable present leadership take sober decision deal outside world. The Revolutionary Guards established dominant position Iran's military, economy, politics. Iran increasingly comes resemble corporatist states southern eastern Europe 1920s '30s call fascist. Iran conducting interior battle demons, millenarians far right choose believe Khamene'i personal representative God earth, pragmatic conservatives simply want responsible leadership, reformists Green movement whose objective put "republic" back Islamic Republic giving people greater voice. This yeasty unpredictable mix. No one knows going happen next. And reality Obama administration must deal with. The danger administration back wrong horse Iran. The real danger Obama administration preoccupied domestic American politics constant demand look tough dealing Iran inadvertently rescue cruel hapless regime ineptitude providing convenient scapegoat everything goes wrong Iran.

http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/opinion/16iht-edcohen.html?2=1&emc=eta18,pagewanted=print July 15, 2010 Inners arid Losers Ey ROGER COHEN NEW YORK — The Clintons threw big Washington bash June 30 Hillary Clinton's longtime aide, Hume Abedin, struck one many guests absence anyone President Obama's tight White House inner circle. Congressional heavyweights thronged garden Clinton spread Embassy Row, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The city's big powerbrokers various State Department honchos party marking Abedin's marriage Congressman Anthony Weiner New York. But White House insiders stayed away. Well, Bill Clinton told CNN recently, "I everything I could defeat President Obama I wanted Hillary win" — old wounds heal overnight. Indeed, may heal all. When informant said something old grievances going away, response hosts went something like this: No, don't never will. But, we're public servants suckers punishment, soldier on. Speaking soldiering on, Mrs. Clinton left Europe next day Americans celebrated July 4, Armenia trying sort Nagorno-Karabakh dispute and.— equally thankless task — mediate Armenia Turkey disagreement happened 1915. You've got salute Hillary. She's got guts go razor-sharp mind. It's heck job secretary state White House puts tight collar around big issues — Afghanistan, Iran, Israel-Palestine Iraq — you're left Nagorno-Karabakh, disputed Ottoman crimes World War I and, you're lucky, U.S. bases Okinawa. The situation might slightly less troubling boys White House — overwhelmingly boys — foreign-policy heavyweights. They're not. Indeed, I'm told Henry Kissinger refers "the kids." Chief among them, according colleague Helene Cooper, Denis McDonough, National Security Council's chief staff. Earlier month, Cooper wrote: "Forget Secretary State Hillary Rodham Clinton Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates. When comes national security, Mr. Obama's inner circle tight largely consists Mr. McDonough, 40-year-old Minnesota unknown Americans." I know McDonough I've spent fair amount time Minnesota. He many state's qualities: positive, brisk, can-do, affable efficient. But I reassured when! read Obama's national-security inner circle comprised him? Nope. He great guy control foreign-policy side campaign — perfection Obama — he's great guy think big world. Thinking big bold required right now. The clock ticking momentous presidential decisions. Among Afghan extrication salvage minimum core U.S. security interests — require bruising negotiation Taliban — Iran becomes apparent end year latest sanctions changed nothing. Obama's apparent carte blanche Israel month Iran disturbing. Then there's Israel-Palestine, Obama can't decide whether cost honest broker pressure sides — worth domestic heat takes critical Israel, result he's zigzagging little effect. After firing Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, Obama said would tolerate debate division. My sense foreign- policy house divided — weaker it. Gen. James Jones, national security adviser, speaks fine French — French love — he's left people unconvinced. Tom Donilon, Jones' deputy, dances around vacuum best can. Like McDonough, David Axelrod Rehm Emanuel brilliant campaign strategists, foreign-policy strategists? In Clinton, Obama Baker-class secretary state. For much longer going delegate Nagorno- Karabakh? The State Department, repository Other underused talent, cannot White House annex non- critical affairs. Back 1860s, James Gordon Bennett, editor New York Herald, forebear International Herald Tribune, gave instructions intrepid foreign correspondent named Henry Morton Stanley: "Draw thousand pounds now; gone that, draw another thousand, spent, draw another thousand, finished that, draw another thousand, on; but, FIND LIVINGSTONE." He referring lost African explorer, David Livingstone, Stanley eventually tracked Lake Tanganyika, uttering immortal words: "Doctor Livingstone, I presume?" That sort journalism's gone fashion. So thank Rolling Stone opening pocketbook telling Michael Hastings whatever took find General McChrystal. In brilliant piece, Hastings that. He also found something else: Afghan policy fragmented team Obama running it. McChrystal's gone, dysfunction. A blow-up, I presume? Watch space.

Netanyahu speaking small group terror victims West Bank settlement Ofra two years stepping prime minister 1999. He appears laid-back. After claiming way deal Palestinian Authority large-scale attack, Netanyahu asked one participants whether United States would let attack come fruition. "I know America is," Netanyahu replied. "America is'a thing move easily, move right direction. They won't get way." He called former president Bill Clinton "radically pro-Palestinian," went belittle Oslo peace accords vulnerable manipulation. Since accords state Israel would allowed hang pre-defined military zones West Bank, Netanyahu told hosts could torpedo accords defining vast swaths land that. "They asked election rd honor [the Oslo accords]," Netanyahu said. "I said I would, ... I'm going interpret accords way would allow put end gallOping forward '67 borders. How it? Nobody said defined military zones were. Defined military zones aresecurity zones; far I'm concerned, entire Jordan Valley defined military zone. Go argue." Smiling, Netanyahu recalled forced former U.S. Secretary State Warren Christopher agree let Israel alone determine parts West Bank defined military zones. "They didn't want give letter," Netanyahu said, "so I didn't give Hebron agreement [the agreement giving Hebron back Palestinians]. I cut cabinet meeting short said, 'I'm signing.' Only letter came, meeting, Arafat, I ratify Hebron agreement. Why important? Because moment on, I de facto put end Oslo accords." President Obama, anyone else concerned Israel's commitment peace process, may watch tape online PI.

The writer someone worked Afghan women developing small businesses Afghanistan book experience. She went back Afghanistan conference women weekend wrote article follows today's Daily Beast. Soraya mentioned one Women Courage. Gayle (the writer) told separate email De Mistura sympathetic said consulted, current documents working documents pledged women would inovled follow up. He also told impressed organized 2-day conference able play effective role. Zakhilwal gracious, said adequately consulted. So goes. Secretary Clinton may one highest-profile attendees Tuesday's Kabul Conference, Afghan women fear opinions won't heard—and worry new deals fighters roll back hard-fought rights. As Hillary Clinton prepares attend Tuesday's Kabul Conference, Afghan women delivering plain message government international officials: Women's voices heard. "We honest. With respect Kabul Conference, consulted," said Soraya Pakzad, founder women's shelter western Afghan city Herat. Her comment came unusually heated question-and- answer session Afghan Finance Minister Omar Zakhilwal United Nations representative Staffan de Mistura marking end two-day women's conference. "We want involved policy-making. We don't want presence purely symbolic." "Women's rights achievements compromised peace negotiations accords." The Kabul Conference is, part, built symbolism. A follow-up January's London Conference, gathering marks first time Afghanistan played host international donors, decision intended showcase transition foreign Afghan ownership national priorities. More 65 international delegations expected descend upon Afghan capital, already enduring security crackdowns traffic gridlock. Workers could seen Sunday painting curbs planting flowers advance foreigners' arrival. Discussions center around five topics, including economic development, agriculture, governance, security. The goal half-day event establish framework Afghan leadership setting—and execution—of country's political economic direction. Although remains seen quickly Afghan govemment, long under-resourced beset allegations corruption, able take reins international donors, question Afghan ownership direction things moving, political, economic, security fronts. And precisely women feel stakes week's meeting high, particularly light new deals empower local militias might threaten women's rights. "After Kabul Conference, one knows else could agenda apart war escalations negotiations," said Orzala Ashraf, Afghan human rights activist. "This important us, get serious honest commitment government presence witnesses world voices silenced." Ashraf number women's advocates view Tuesday's talks last, best shot speaking concerns, help European American officials working hard help win seat table. In another show support, Secretary Clinton Danish Foreign Minister Lene Espersen meet Tuesday morning group women leaders. Regardless high-profile backing, many women say little faith process produce anything aside paper unkept promises. "Women tired conferences; government going show commitments," said Selay Ghaffar, Afghan Women's Network board member. "We want things change." And remains unclear many Afghans outside Kabul, men women, paying attention yet another gathering discuss future. "Women provinces don't even know this," said Zainab, young math teacher Helmand province. "I would say 60 percent women idea going on." Others say presence one two women Kabul Conference isn't enough make difference. And say fear recent move NATO empower local militias fight Taliban, particularly southern Afghanistan. "This dangerous," said Shahida Hussain, human rights advocate Kandahar worked community organizer Taliban years. "We militias communist years Afghanistan destroyed. We fear war again." Women leaders say want peace glad welcome back former fighters, respect women's constitutional guarantee equal protections law. "Women constituent part bodies outlined Afghanistan Peace Reintegration Plan," said women statement end meeting. "Women's rights achievements compromised peace negotiations accords." In meantime, women continue fight voice Tuesday approaches. After weeklong flurry conference calls, embassy meetings, lunchtime gatherings, two women aside government ministers slated speak. And small victory women, international officials agreed Pakzad's assessment pledging women would involved going forward. "I agree, consulted," said da Mistura, appearing contradict Afghan finance minister, moments earlier said women's views would included. "As usual, paying lip service fault that."

I'm pretty sure I gave original lauren soon I received it. Doubt I made copy I may cause he'd asked tour. Let check tomorrow.
H: I'm sure preoccupied adventures Lula, et al. Nonetheless, article below, posted NY Review, soon published, breakthrough piece large impact. It's worth reading, least Frank Luntz's poll numbers. The hysterical tone much Israeli leadership US Jewish community partly rooted long-term profound development. Sid http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/jun/10/failure-american-jewish-establishment/ The Failure American Jewish Establishment June 10, 2010 Peter Beinart E-mail Single Page Share More Peter Beinart anjamin Netanyahu; drawing John Springs In 2003, several prominent Jewish philanthropists hired Republican pollster Frank Luntz explain American Jewish college students vigorously rebutting campus criticism Israel. In response, unwittingly produced damning indictment organized American Jewish community I ever seen. The philanthropists wanted know Jewish students thought Israel. Luntz found mostly didn't. "Six times brought Jewish youth together group talk Jewishness connection Israel," reported. "Six times topic Israel come prompted. Six times Jewish youth used word 'they' rather than'us` describe situation." That Luntz encountered indifference surprising. In recent years, several studies revealed, words Steven Cohen Hebrew Union College An Kelman University California Davis, "non-Orthodox younger Jews, whole, feel much less attached Israel elders," many professing "a near-total absence positive feelings." In 2008, student senate Brandeis, nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored university America, rejected resolution commemorating sixtieth anniversary Jewish state. Luntz's task figure gone wrong. When probed students' views Israel, hit firm beliefs. First, "they reserve right question Israeli position." These young Jews, Luntz explained, "resist anything see 'group think." They want "open frank" discussion Israel flaws. Second, "young Jews desperately want peace." When Luntz showed series ads, one popular entitled "Proof Israel Wants Peace," listed offers various Israeli governments withdraw conquered land. Third, "some empathize plight Palestinians." When Luntz displayed ads depicting Palestinians violent hateful, several focus group participants criticized stereotypical unfair, citing Muslim friends. Most students, words, liberals, broadly defined. They imbibed defining values American Jewish political culture: belief open debate, skepticism military force, commitment human rights. And innocence, realize supposed shed values came Israel. The kind Zionism found attractive Zionism recognized Palestinians deserving dignity capable peace, quite willing condemn Israeli government share beliefs. Luntz grasp irony. The kind Zionism found attractive kind American Jewish establishment working lives. Among American Jews today, great many Zionists, especially Orthodox world, people deeply devoted State Israel. And great many liberals, especially secular Jewish world, people deeply devoted human rights people, Palestinians included. But two groups increasingly distinct. Particularly younger generations, fewer fewer American Jewish liberals Zionists; fewer fewer American Jewish Zionists liberal. One reason leading institutions American Jewry refused foster—indeed, actively opposed—a Zionism challenges Israel's behavior West Bank Gaza Strip toward Arab citizens. For several decades, Jewish establishment asked American Jews check liberalism Zionism's door, now, horror, finding many young Jews checked Zionism instead. Morally, American Zionism downward spiral. If leaders groups like AIPAC Conference Presidents Major American Jewish Organizations change course, wake one day find younger, Orthodox- dominated, Zionist leadership whose naked hostility Arabs Palestinians scares even them, mass secular American Jews range apathetic appalled. Saving liberal Zionism United States—so American Jews help save liberal Zionism Israel—is great American Jewish challenge age. And starts Luntz's students wanted start: talking frankly Israel's current government, longer averting eyes. Since 1990s, journalists scholars describing bifurcation Israeli society. In words Hebrew University political scientist Yaron Ezrahi, "After decades came called national consensus, Zionist narrative liberation [has] dissolved openly contesting versions." One version, "founded long memory persecution, genocide, bitter struggle survival, pessimistic, distrustful non-Jews, believing Jewish power solidarity." Another, "nourished secularized Versions messianism well Enlightenment idea progress," articulates "a deep sense limits military force, commitment liberal-democratic values." Every country manifests kind ideological divide. But contemporary Israel, gulf among widest earth. As Ezrahi others noted, latter, liberal-democratic Zionism grown alongside new individualism, particularly among secular Israelis, greater demand free expression, greater skepticism coercive authority. You see spirit "new historians" like Tom Segev fearlessly excavated darker corners Zionist past jurists like former Supreme Court President Aharon Barak overturned Knesset laws violate human rights guarantees Israel's "Basic Laws." You also see former Prime Minister Ehud Barak's apparent willingness relinquish much West Bank 2000 early 2001. But Israel today, humane, universalistic Zionism wield power. To contrary, gasping air. To understand deeply antithetical values Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, it's worth considering case Effi Eitam. Eitam, charismatic ex–cabinet minister war hero, proposed ethnically cleansing Palestinians West Bank. "We'll expel overwhelming majority West Bank Arabs remove Israeli Arabs [the] political system," declared 2006. In 2008, Eitam merged small Ahi Party Netanyahu's Likud. And 2009-2010 academic year, Netanyahu's special emissary overseas "campus engagement." In capacity, visited dozen American high schools colleges last fall Israeli government's behalf. The group organized tour called "Caravan Democracy." Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman shared Eitam's views. In youth, briefly joined Meir Kahane's banned Kach Party, also advocated expulsion Arabs Israeli soil. Now Lieberman's position might called "pre-expulsion." He wants revoke citizenship Israeli Arabs won't swear loyalty oath Jewish state. He tried prevent two Arab parties opposed Israel's 2008-2009 Gaza war running candidates Knesset. He said Arab Knesset members met representatives Hamas executed. He wants jail Arabs publicly mourn Israeli Independence Day, hopes permanently deny citizenship Arabs countries marry Arab citizens Israel. You don't paranoid see connection Lieberman's current views former ones. The strip Israeli Arabs legal protection, accuse treason, thinkable policy expulsion becomes. Lieberman's American defenders often note theory supports Palestinian state. What usually fail mention him, two-state solution means redrawing Israel's border large chunk Israeli Arabs find exiled another country, without consent. Lieberman served chief staff Netanyahu's first term prime minister. And comes West Bank, Netanyahu's record way even extreme protégé's. In 1993 book, A Place among Nations, Netanyahu rejects idea Palestinian state, denies thing Palestinian. In fact, repeatedly equates Palestinian bid statehood Nazism. An Israel withdraws West Bank, declared, would "ghetto-state" "Auschwitz borders." And effort "to gouge Judea Samaria [the West Bank] Israel" resembles Hitler's bid wrench German-speaking "Sudeten district" Czechoslovakia 1938. It unfair, Netanyahu insists, ask Israel concede territory since already made vast, gut-wrenching concessions. What kind concessions? It abandoned claim Jordan, rights part Jewish state. On left Netanyahu's coalition sits Ehud Barak's emasculated Labor Party, whatever moderating potential may counterbalanced is, ways, illiberal coalition partner all, Shas, ultra-Orthodox party representing Jews North African Middle Eastern descent. At one point, Shas—like Ashkenazi ultra- Orthodox counterparts—was open dismantling settlements. In recent years, however, ultra-Orthodox Israelis, anxious find housing large families, increasingly moved West Bank, thanks government subsidies far cheaper live. Not coincidentally, political parties swung hard territorial compromise. And done virulence reflects ultra-Orthodox Judaism's profound hostility liberal values. Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Shas's immensely powerful spiritual leader, called Arabs "vipers," "snakes," "ants." In 2005, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon proposed dismantling settlements Gaza Strip, Yosef urged "God strike down." The official Shas newspaper recently called President Obama "an Islamic extremist." Hebrew University Professor Ze'ev Sternhell expert fascism winner prestigious Israel Prize. Commenting Lieberman leaders Shas recent Op-Ed Haaretz, wrote, "The last time politicians holding views similar power post–World War II Western Europe Franco's Spain." With blessing, "a crude multifaceted campaign waged foundations democratic liberal order." Sternhell know. In September 2008, injured settler set pipe bomb house. Israeli governments come go, Netanyahu coalition product frightening, long-term trends Israeli society: ultra-Orthodox population increasing dramatically, settler movement growing radical entrenched Israeli bureaucracy army, Russian immigrant community particularly prone anti-Arab racism. In 2009, poll Israel Democracy Institute found 53 percent Jewish Israelis (and 77 percent recent immigrants former USSR) support encouraging Arabs leave country. Attitudes worst among Israel's young. When Israeli high schools held mock elections last year, Lieberman won. This March, poll found 56 percent Jewish Israeli high school students—and 80 percent religious Jewish high school students— would deny Israeli Arabs right elected Knesset. An education ministry official called survey "a huge warning signal light strengthening trends extremist views among youth." You might think trends, sympathy expressed Israel's government, would occasion substantial public concern—even outrage—among leaders organized American Jewry. You would wrong. In Israel itself, voices left, even center, warn increasingly urgent tones threats Israeli democracy. (Former Prime Ministers Ehud Olmert Ehud Barak said Israel risks becoming "apartheid state" continues hold West Bank. This April, settlers forced large Israeli bookstore stop selling book critical occupation, Shulamit Aloni, former head dovish Meretz Party, declared "Israel democratic time now.") But United States, groups like AIPAC Presidents' Conference patrol public discourse, scolding people contradict vision Israel state leaders cherish democracy yearn peace. The result terrible irony. In theory, mainstream American Jewish organizations still hew liberal vision Zionism. On website, AIPAC celebrates Israel's commitment "free speech minority rights." The Conference Presidents declares "Israel United States share political, moral intellectual values including democracy, freedom, security peace." These groups would never say, Netanyahu's coalition, Israeli Arabs don't deserve full citizenship West Bank Palestinians don't deserve human rights. But practice, defending virtually anything Israeli government does, make intellectual bodyguards Israeli leaders threaten liberal values profess admire. After Israel's elections last February, instance, Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice-chairman Presidents' Conference, explained Avigdor Lieberman's agenda "far moderate media presented it." Insisting Lieberman bears general animus toward Israeli Arabs, Abraham Foxman, national director Anti- Defamation League, told Jewish Telegraphic Agency "He's saying expel them. He's saying punish them." (Permanently denying citizenship Arab spouses jailing publicly mourn Israeli Independence Day evidently qualify punishment.) The ADL criticized anti-Arab bigotry past, American Jewish Committee, credit, warned Lieberman's proposed loyalty oath would "chill Israel's democratic political debate." But Forward summed overall response America's communal Jewish leadership headline "Jewish Leaders Largely Silent Lieberman's Role Government." Not organized American Jewish community mostly avoid public criticism Israeli government, tries prevent others leveling criticism well. In recent years, American Jewish organizations waged campaign discredit world's respected international human rights groups. In 2006, Foxman called Amnesty International report Israeli killing Lebanese civilians "bigoted, biased, borderline anti-Semitic." The Conference Presidents announced "biased NGOs include Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Christian Aid, [and] Save Children." Last summer, AIPAC spokesman declared Human Rights Watch "has repeatedly demonstrated anti-Israel bias." When Obama administration awarded Presidential Medal Freedom Mary Robinson, former UN high commissioner human rights, ADL AIPAC protested, citing fact presided 2001 World Conference Against Racism Durban, South Africa. (Early drafts conference report implicitly accused Israel racism. Robinson helped expunge defamatory charge, angering Syria Iran.) Human Rights Watch Amnesty International infallible. But groups like AIPAC Presidents' Conference avoid virtually public criticism Israeli actions—directing outrage solely Israel's neighbors—they leave poor position charge bias. Moreover, American Jewish groups claim simply defending Israel foes, actually taking sides struggle within Israel radically different Zionist visions. At moment Anti-Defamation League claimed Robinson harbored "animus toward Israel," alliance seven Israeli human rights groups publicly congratulated award. Many groups, like B'Tselem, monitors Israeli actions Occupied Territories, Israeli branch Physicians Human Rights, least critical Israel's actions Lebanon, Gaza, West Bank Amnesty International Human Rights Watch. All raises uncomfortable question. If American Jewish groups claim Israel's overseas human rights critics motivated anti- Israeli, anti-Semitic, bias, say Israel's domestic human rights critics? The implication clear: must guilty self-hatred, treason. American Jewish leaders don't generally say that, course, allies Netanyahu government do. Last summer, Israel's vice prime minister, Moshe Ya'alon, called anti-occupation group Peace Now "virus." This January, right-wing group called Im Tirtzu accused Israeli human rights organizations fed information Goldstone Commission investigated Israel's Gaza war. A Knesset member Netanyahu's Likud promptly charged Naomi Chazan, head New Israel Fund, supports human rights groups, treason, member Lieberman's party launched investigation aimed curbing foreign funding Israeli NG0s. To credit, Foxman American Jewish leaders opposed move, might impaired work. But reaping sowed. If suggest mainstream human rights criticism Israel's government motivated animus toward state, toward Jews general, give aid comfort Israel make charges human rights critics midst. In American Jewish establishment today, language liberal Zionism—with idioms human rights, equal citizenship, territorial compromise—has drained meaning. It remains lingua franca part generational reasons, many older American Zionists still see liberals sort. They vote Democratic; unmoved biblical claims West Bank; see average Palestinians decent people betrayed bad leaders; secular. They don't want Jewish organizations criticize Israel left, neither want agents Israeli right. These American Zionists largely product particular era. Many shaped terrifying days leading Six-Day War, appeared Israel might overrun, bitter aftermath Yom Kippur War, much world seemed turn Jewish state. In crucible, Israel became Jewish identity, often conjunction Holocaust, 1967 1973 wars helped make central American Jewish life. These Jews embraced Zionism settler movement became major force Israeli politics, 1982 Lebanon war, first intifada. They fell love Israel secular, less divided, less shaped culture, politics, theology occupation. And downplaying significance Avigdor Lieberman, settlers, Shas, American Jewish groups allow older Zionists continue identify internally cohesive, innocent Israel youth, Israel exists memories. But secular Zionists aren't reproducing themselves. Their children memory Arab armies massed Israel's border Israel surviving part thanks urgent military assistance United States. Instead, grown viewing Israel regional hegemon occupying power. As result, conscious parents degree Israeli behavior violates liberal ideals, less willing grant Israel exemption survival seems peril. Because inherited parents' liberalism, cannot embrace uncritical Zionism. Because liberalism real, see liberalism American Jewish establishment fake. To sustain uncritical brand Zionism, therefore, America's Jewish organizations need look elsewhere replenish ranks. They need find young American. Jews come age West Bank occupation troubled it. And young American Jews come disproportionately Orthodox world. Because marry earlier, intermarry less, children, Orthodox Jews growing rapidly share American Jewish population. According 2006 American Jewish Committee (AJC) survey, Orthodox Jews make 12 percent American Jewry age sixty, constitute 34 percent ages eighteen twenty-four. For America's Zionist organizations, Orthodox youngsters potential bonanza. In yeshivas learn devotion Israel early age; generally spend year religious study high school, often know friends relatives immigrated Israel. The AJC study found 16 percent non-Orthodox adult Jews age forty feel "very close Israel," among Orthodox figure 79 percent. As secular Jews drift away America's Zionist institutions, Orthodox counterparts likely step breach. The Orthodox "are still interested parochial Jewish concerns," explains Samuel Heilman, sociologist City University New York. "They among last ones stayed Jewish house, control lights." But parochialism—a deep commitment Jewish concerns, often outweighs universal ones— gives Orthodox Jewish Zionism distinctly illiberal cast. The 2006 AJC poll found 60 percent non- Orthodox American Jews age forty support Palestinian state, figure drops 25 percent among Orthodox. In 2009, Brandeis University's Theodore Sasson asked American Jewish focus groups Israel, found Orthodox participants much less supportive dismantling settlements part peace deal. Even tellingly, Reform, Conservative, unaffiliated Jews tended believe average Palestinians wanted peace, ill- served leaders. Orthodox Jews, contrast, likely see Palestinian people enemy, deny ordinary Palestinians shared common interests values ordinary Israelis Jews. Orthodox Judaism great virtues, including communal warmth commitment Jewish learning unmatched American Jewish world. (I'm biased, since family attends Orthodox synagogue.) But current trends continue, growing influence Orthodox Jews America's Jewish communal institutions erode even liberal-democratic veneer today covers American Zionism. In 2002, America's major Jewish organizations sponsored large Israel solidarity rally Washington Mall. Up east coast, yeshivas shut day, swelling estimated Orthodox share crowd close 70 percent. When Deputy Secretary Defense Paul Wolfowitz told rally "innocent Palestinians suffering dying well," booed. America's Jewish leaders think hard rally. Unless change course, portends future: American Zionist movement even feign concern Palestinian dignity broader American Jewish population even feign concern Israel. My children, given upbringing, could easily end among booers among Luntz's focus group. Either prospect fills dread. In 2004, effort prevent weapons smuggling Egypt, Israeli tanks bulldozers demolished hundreds houses Rafah refugee camp southern Gaza Strip. Watching television, veteran Israeli commentator politician named Tommy Lapid saw elderly Palestinian woman crouched fours looking medicines amid ruins home. He said reminded grandmother. In moment, Lapid captured spirit suffocating within organized American Jewish life. To begin with, watched. In experience, epidemic watching among American Zionists today. A Red Cross study malnutrition Gaza Strip, bill Knesset allow Jewish neighborhoods bar entry Israeli Arabs, Israeli human rights report settlers burning Palestinian olive groves, three Palestinian teenagers shot—it's unpleasant. Rationalizing minimizing Palestinian suffering become kind game. In recent report foster Zionism among America's young, Luntz urges American Jewish groups use word "Arabs, Palestinians," since "the term `Palestinians' evokes images refugee camps, victims oppression," "Arab' says wealth, oil Islam." Of course, Israel—like United States—must sometimes take morally difficult actions defense. But morally difficult allow human connection side. Otherwise, security justifies everything. The heads AIPAC Presidents' Conference ask Israel's leaders would say make scream "no." After all, Lieberman foreign minister; Effi Eitam touring American universities; settlements growing triple rate Israeli population; half Israeli Jewish high school students want Arabs barred Knesset. If line yet crossed, line? What infuriated critics Lapid's comment grandmother died Auschwitz. How dare defile memory Holocaust? Of course, Holocaust immeasurably worse anything Israel done ever do. • But least Lapid used Jewish suffering connect suffering others. In world AIPAC, Holocaust analogies never stop, message always same: Jews licensed victimhood worry themselves. Many Israel's founders believed statehood, Jews would rightly judged way treated non-Jews living dominion. "For first time shall majority living minority," Knesset member Pinchas Lavon declared 1948, "and shall called upon provide example prove Jews live minority." But message American Jewish establishment allies Netanyahu government exactly opposite: since Jews history's permanent victims, always knife-edge extinction, moral responsibility luxury Israel have. Its responsibility survive. As former Knesset speaker Avraham Burg writes remarkable 2008 book, The Holocaust Is Over; We Must Rise From Its Ashes, "Victimhood sets free." This obsession victimhood lies heart Zionism dying among America's secular Jewish young. It simply bears relationship lived experience, seen Israel's. Yes, Israel faces threats Hezbollah Hamas. Yes, Israelis understandably worry nuclear Iran. But dilemmas face possess dozens hundreds nuclear weapons, adversary, however despicable, may acquire one, dilemmas Warsaw Ghetto. The year 2010 not, Benjamin Netanyahu claimed, 1938. The drama Jewish victimhood—a drama feels natural many Jews lived 1938, 1948, even 1967—strikes today's young American Jews farce. But different Zionist calling, never desperately relevant. It roots Israel's Independence Proclamation, promised Jewish state "will based precepts liberty, justice peace taught Hebrew prophets," December 1948 letter Albert Einstein, Hannah Arendt, others The New York Times, protesting right-wing Zionist leader Menachem Begin's visit United States party's militias massacred Arab civilians village Deir Yassin. It call recognize world Jewish fortunes radically changed, best way memorialize history Jewish suffering ethical use Jewish power. For several months now, group Israeli students traveling every Friday East Jerusalem neighborhood Sheikh Jarrah, Palestinian family named Ghawis lives street outside home fifty-three years, evicted make room Jewish settlers. Although repeatedly arrested protesting without permit, called traitors self-haters Israeli right, students keep coming, numbers swelling thousands. What American Jewish organizations brought young people speak Hillel? What face Zionism shown America's Jewish young? What students Luntz's focus group told generation faces challenge momentous Jewish history: save liberal democracy Jewish state earth? "Too many years I lived warm embrace institutionalized elusiveness part it," writes Avraham Burg. "I comfortable there." I know; I comfortable too. But comfortable Zionism become moral abdication. Let's hope Luntz's students, solidarity counterparts Sheikh Jarrah, foster uncomfortable Zionism, Zionism angry Israel risks becoming, love still could be. Let's hope care enough try. —May 12, 2010 .

POLITICO Breaking News: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu canceled visit White House aftermath Israeli military's action flotilla seeking access Gaza, AP reports. White House spokesman Bill Burton said advance Netanyahu's decision White House currently "to understand circumstances surrounding tragedy."

He called you. Wants discuss situation israel trip cancellation. Says he's flexible time wise. Phil gordon jeff feltman obviously following situation. We don't formal talking points yet.
First observation: Bibi's Entebbe reverse. The father, Benzion Netanyahu, 100 years old, secretary Jabotinsky, denounced radical Begin, adored son Yoni, heroically killed Entebbe. Benyamin never measured up. Benzion constantly criticized public deviations doctrine Greater Israel. Bibi desperately seeks father's approbation never equal dead brother. See Benzion's recent scathing undermining son Bibi Bibi's tearful tribute brother last month. The raid ship Gaza resembles raid Entebbe, except hostages, guns, it's Africa, it's fiasco; otherwise, it's Entebbe. (Then, there's Ehud Barak reliving youth raider killing Palestinians Lebanon, feat memorialized Spielberg's film, Munich. Ultimately, didn't work well time either. The film captures moral quandaries, appear escaped participants.) Further observation: The international press inquire whether Obama administration gave wink nod Bush administration Lebanon Gaza incursions. Be prepared. Further: Of course, consequences US foreign policy national security negative across board: analogy North Korean ship sinking Chinese posture support Iranian sanctions, etc., etc. Did Israelis hear Petraeus's testimony? Further: Of course, whatever outcome raid, one inevitable ones would death peace process, is, eve Bibi's scheduled visit Obama, would been, circumstance, light raid, profoundly humiliating president. Or Israelis bone stupid? I don't think so. Cheers, Sid Like Father, Like Son? Netanyahu's Father Says Son Not Serious About Two-State Solution. July 8, 2009 1 Comment In controversial interview Israel's Channel II News, father Prime Minister Netanyahu, Professor Benzion Netanyahu, says son support Palestinian state. The elder Netanyahu, claims prime Minister told deliberately placed impossible conditions Palestinians. Here excerpts interview. When asked son really changed position concerning Palestinian state, 100 year-old historian unequivocally answered: (translation mine) "He support. He supports conditions (the Arabs) never accept it. That I heard him. I didn't propose conditions, did. They never accept conditions. Not one them." When asked personal opinion Palestinian state, senior Netanyahu stated: Herzl Nordau (fathers zionist movement) labor create Palestinian state. This land Jewish land land Arabs. There place Arabs, wont place Arabs. They never agree conditions.

Netanyahu convinced going forced extend settlement construction freeze, due expire September. According senior officials Jerusalem, agreement already reached administration Israeli government announce extension construction freeze territories, Americans "make sure" Palestinians withdraw talks. Israel, however, take "aggressive" action construction resumed areas clearly within consensus inside settlement blocs. The Prime Minister 's Bureau vigorously denied report. "The statements attributed prime minister incorrect," said spokesman Prime Minister's Bureau. "They said Netanyahu forum. The reason simple: prime minister think that, Prime Minister Netanyahu holds great esteem commitment President Obama administration Israel's security efforts renew peace process region." Eli Bardenstein adds: The formal invitation Netanyahu received yesterday meet President Obama next week might attest radical change White House's attitude towards him. Political sources Israel described planned meeting "the peak campaign Israel Jews pursued Obama administration past number weeks."

Published The New Republic (http://www.tnr.com) The Unnecessary Fall A counter-history Obama presidency. • John B. Judis • August 12, 2010 I 12:00 On April 14, 2009, Barack Obama's standing polls beginning slip, Tea Party demonstrators amassing Washington tax day protests, president gave lengthy address atGeorgetown University explaining "five pillars" economic policies. The speech intended promote memorable slogan Obama's program would evoke comparisons Theodore Roosevelt's Square Deal, Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. Obama's contribution New Foundation. "We must lay new foundation growth prosperity—a foundation move us era borrow spend one save invest," declared. Obama would repeat phrase seven times day many occasions next months. At Obama's private White House dinner presidential historians June, historians impressed public New Foundation slogan. "I don't think it's going work," Robert Dallek warned. Doris Kearns Goodwin said sounded "like woman's girdle." One historians might able forewarn Obama slogan unsuccessfully deployed Democratic president before. In 1979 State Union address, Jimmy Carter began, "Tonight, I want examine broad sense state American Union—how building new foundation peaceful prosperous world." Carter would use phrase five times speech, including conclusion, asked members Congress join "in building new foundation." Like Obama's effort, phrase inspired, most, underwear jokes forgotten. Obama's evocation Carter obviously unintended—but Man Plains indeed specter hanging presidency. Of course, Obama already accomplished first 20 months Jimmy Carter entire presidency. But disturbing political resemblance two presidencies. Both men ran inspired campaigns positioned scandals partisan quarrels predecessors initially stirred hopes "transformational" presidency. But, presidents, men somehow failed connect large parts electorate. To sure, number specific reasons Carter Obama landed political trouble. Both men contended rising unemployment—Carter rampant inflation well—and voters' approval president party tend track closely changes economy. Carter faced friction party rise powerful business lobby, Obama dealt Republican Party frustrated dreams post-partisan presidency. Yet important reason difficulties—evident inept attempts brand programs—has inability develop politics resonates public. In United States, politics pivots around allegiance middle class, even identity changed yeoman farmers mechanics store clerks, office workers, x-ray technicians, small business owners. They are, Bill Clinton's words, "those work hard play rules." They central characters populist rhetoric goes back early republic. It depicts middle class embattled threatened either forces (impoverished immigrants, welfare cheaters, ghetto rioters) (Wall Street speculators, state bureaucrats, K Street lobbyists). Populism embraced Glenn Beck Tom Harkin. It intrinsically neither left-wing right-wing. Politicians, Franklin Roosevelt Ronald Reagan, found way using populism's appeal downturns enjoyed success, spurned suffered accordingly. If, circumstances like present one, don't develop populist politics, adversaries use populism define enemy people. That's Carter discovered stagflation late '70s. And that's happened last 20 months Great Recession Barack Obama Democratic Party leads. Obama took office widespread popular support, even among Republicans, first efforts, including $800 billion stimulus, initially enjoyed strong public favor. But wide appeal began dissipate late spring 2009. Disillusion Obama fueled November defeat Democratic gubernatorial candidates New Jersey Virginia. By January 2010, crucial factor Republican Scott Brown's astonishing victory Martha Coakley Massachusetts. In postmortem debate defeats, Democrats blamed Obama's dogged pursuit health care reform economy hemorrhaging jobs. That may factor, real damage done earlier. What doomed Obama politically way dealt financial crisis first six months presidency. In atmosphere primed populist backlash, allowed right wing define terms. As Obama delivering inaugural address, financial crisis already full swing; already apparent financial speculation, outright fraud, irresponsible sometimes illegal housing-loan practices played large role precipitating crisis. The public arms. But, instead rallying public "money changers," Roosevelt done first inaugural, Obama, taking leaf Jimmy Carter's infamous "malaise" speech, put blame public whole. "Our economy badly weakened, consequence greed irresponsibility part some, also collective failure make hard choices prepare nation new age," declared. Over next month, Obama would periodically criticize bankers embarrassing revelations—at various times calling bonuses gave "shameful" "outrage"—but, hearing complaints rhetoric bankers, would back off. At private meeting March 28 13 Wall Street CEOs, president, spokesman Robert Gibbs said, "emphasized Wall Street needs Main Street Main Street needs Wall Street." And, Georgetown speech, Obama returned theme collective responsibility. The recession, Obama said, "was caused perfect storm irresponsibility poor decision-making stretched Wall Street Washington Main Street." Obama's policy followed swerving course rhetoric. One week, would favor harsh restrictions bank insurance-company bonuses, but, next week, would waver; one week, would support legislation allowing bankruptcy judges reduce amount homeowners threatened foreclosure owed banks; next week, would fail protest bank lobbyists pressured Senate kill provisions. But, importantly, Obama—in sharp contrast Roosevelt first months—failed push Congress immediately enact new financial regulations even set commission investigate fraud. (When Congress finally appointed commission July 2009, Obama party put milquetoast Democratic politician, former California State Treasurer Philip Angelides, charge it.) Obama's appointments also conveyed impression wanted let Wall Street hook. He appointed Timothy Geithner treasury secretary. Geithner claimed part Wall Street, but, capacity president Federal Reserve Bank New York, served board directors headed JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. As New York Fed president, Geithner partly responsible decision let Lehman Brothers go under, unpopular tarp program, American International Group (MG) paying back Wall Street creditors government money. Geithner chose chief staff former lobbyist Goldman Sachs. Retiring Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan told me, "Most Americans reading massive compensations bailouts, administration largely hired people culture Wall Street." By spring, Obama's apparent tilt Wall Street sparked right-wing populist revolt country. The newly formed Tea Party movement, Beck Fox News, host right-wing bloggers leading charge; but, less extreme form, general public shared anger. In early April New York Times/CBS News poll, public disapproved Obama's aiding banks 58 percent 33 percent. In poll, public approval Obama's handling economy began fall. Pollsters focus groups also traced disillusionment Obama's economic policies handling financial crisis. Congressman Barney Frank, defends Obama's policies, acknowledges president's political difficulties began revelation MG, received $170 billion government, paid $165 billion bonuses division brought company down. Geithner known bonuses insisted legal grounds block them. (It came Geithner pressured Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd insert provision stimulus bill protected bonuses.) "The pitchforks out. It added injury injury," Frank says. That's public opinion Geithner plummeted. According Rasmussen poll, 24 percent favorable view Geithner 44 percent unfavorable one. The public's view bank bailout AIG bonuses colored view auto bailout, stimulus, health care reform. One rallying cries populist opposition Obama "where's bailout?" (Obama acknowledged "one frequent questions" asked letters.) The auto program became bailout Big Three CEOs; stimulus became bailout government itself; health care reform bailout uninsured—or "reparations," Rush Limbaugh put it. Wrote right-wing blogger Michelle Malkin, "hardworking citizens getting sick played chumps" "moochers, big small, corporate individual, trampling hands demanding endless bailouts." Obama Democrats successfully portrayed aiding "the moochers," "hardworking citizens." In American politics, that's recipe political disaster. Some White House political operation recognized late spring administration's economic efforts defined right-wing populism tried push Obama take populist tack. A group within White House began calling "pitchfork gang," would find attempts convince Obama get tough Wall Street insurance companies undermined Geithner National Economic Council head Larry Summers, worried upsetting business confidence. "There continual tension White House," says person privy discussions. "One week, would hot, then, next week, would dial back." By early January year, Obama clearly losing battle middle class. According CNN poll, 60 percent Americans thought Obama "had paid attention problems faced banks financial institutions" "problems faced middle class Americans." Only 28 percent, barely quarter, thought paid attention middle class. As Brown surged ahead Coakley polls, White House temporarily embraced populist approach. On January 14, Obama called bank bonuses "obscene" said, "we want money back." In January 22 speech Lorain County Community College Elyria, Ohio (a far cry Georgetown), Obama used word "fighting" 13 times "fight" nine times. "I stop fighting you," declared. But, faced falling stock market anger Wall Street, Obama turned conciliatory. On February io, said didn't "begrudge" $17 million bonus awarded Dimon $9 million Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein. "I know guys. They savvy businessmen." Obama's reluctance rail Wall Street might led watered-down financial reform bill, even bill all, but, April 16, Securities Exchange Commission indicted Goldman Sachs fraud. The next week, emboldened Obama went New York criticize bankers directly "failure responsibility." As result indictment Obama's rediscovery anger, Republicans became somewhat less obstructionist, moderate Republicans broke party's leadership, moderate Democrats fell line. Congress produced much stronger bill Democrats ever expected. But Obama's embrace populism remained fitful sporadic. After U.S. Chamber Commerce Verizon's Ivan Seidenberg, head Business Roundtable, criticized Obama anti-business June, president dispatched Geithner, White House aide Valerie Jarrett, Bill Clinton appease business community. Obama said enough anger CEOs, failed convey greater public fighting them. Obama's unwillingness buck Wall Street Business Roundtable, along delayed muddled response BP disaster Gulf, eroded public's confidence leadership. In Pew's midyear report card Obama's image, greatest drop February 2009 June perception Obama "strong leader." Voters sometimes tolerate policies question presidents like John Kennedy Reagan, regard "strong," politicians like Jimmy Carter, regard weak. What factors behind Obama's political difficulties? There doubt that, economy growing faster, unemployment dropping 9 percent, Obama Democrats would popular fearing November rout. But, unfortunately, economy's sluggish recovery cannot completely disentangled White House's weak political performance. In January, White House debated large stimulus propose, Christina Romer, head Council Economic Advisors, proposed $1.2 trillion Keynesian jolt. David Obey, chairman House Budget Committee, told The Fiscal Times Obama's Treasury Department asked initially $1.4 trillion bill. But administration finally proposed stimulus $700 $800 billion included large tax cuts likely stimulate saving consumption—and spending would unlikely produce many jobs end Obama's first term. In stimulus's first year, administration spent $17 billion $139 billion allocated infrastructure spending. Prominent economists, including Paul Krugman Joseph Stiglitz, made case much larger stimulus necessary reverse (rather merely reduce) rise unemployment, that, modest stimulus failed reduce unemployment, Republicans would convince public stimulus toxic medication would block additional Keynesian measures. That argument proven sadly correct. Some White House advisers appear underestimated depth Great Recession. Others seem doubted administration political clout get Congress. But White House might gotten Obama proclaimed national economic emergency (which was); framed issue terms rescuing middle class damage done Wall Street speculators, short-sighted CEOs, Chinese mercantilism; directly attacked Republicans heartless obstructionists. When Obama belatedly made sort case eve financial reform vote year, got much stronger bill anyone anticipated. So it's clear failure get larger stimulus—which ended hurting administration politically—wasn't result political timidity. The president also suffered inability explain public sought large stimulus thought could accomplish. Obama's New Foundation speech Georgetown soon forgotten. Afterward, Obama, dismay Democrats Congress White House aides, pretty much dropped jobs issue. From Labor Day, devoted July visit Buffalo August stopover southern Indiana issue—at time right wing mobilizing him. Obama didn't fail develop consistent narrative economy; didn't really try. Contrast Obama's attempt develop politics justify economic program Reagan 1982. Faced steadily rising unemployment, went 8.6 percent January 10.4 percent November, Reagan political staff, included James Baker, Mike Deaver, Ed Rollins, forged strategy early year calling voters "stay course" blaming current economic troubles Democratic profligacy. "We clearing away economic wreckage dumped laps," Reagan declared. Democrats accused playing "the blame game," strategy, followed letter White House ten months, worked. The Republicans predicted lose many 50 House seats, lost 26 broke even Senate. Some commentators noted Reagan's popularity even lower Obama's. But, key economic questions, much better Obama Democrats currently performing—and voters expressed far greater patience Reagan's program. According polls, even unemployment rate climbed, narrow plurality still expressed confidence Reagan's program would help economy. On eve election, unemployment rate postwar high, New York Times/CBS News poll found 6o percent likely voters thought Reagan's economic program would eventually help country. That's sign successful political operation. If Obama could command numbers, Democrats could seriously limit losses November. But Obama able develop narrative could convince people trust Democrats. Why White House failed convince public fighting effectively behalf? The principal culprit clearly Barack Obama. He strange aversion confrontational politics. His aversion strange schooled it, working community organizer 198os, tutelage activists subscribed teachings radical Saul Alinsky. But, Obama departed Harvard Law School 1988, left Alinsky adversarial tactics behind. The young lawyer returned Chicago won seat Illinois state Senate 1996 practiced different style politics. Obama's principal accomplishments Springfield bills restricting lobbying requiring videotaping confessions potential death penalty cases. He typical blue-collar, bread-and-butter Chicago Democrat, kind good government liberal represents upscale districts city, seeing politics higher calling ill ease (although open opposition to) city's Democratic machine. He also post- racial politician eschewed hard-edged, angry rhetoric Jesse Jackson. (That, too, oddly reminiscent Carter, partly campaigned 1976 white Southern antidote George Wallace's angry racial populism.) Obama carried outlook U.S. Senate, campaign presidency, then, presidency itself. He cerebral, dispassionate, post-partisan; wants "end political strategy based division," "turn page" culture wars 1960s partisan battles 1990s. During campaign, aides jokingly referred "black Jesus." While tolerate even brush aside conflict, reluctant actively foment it. "In time crisis, can't afford govern anger," declared February 2009. During campaign first year office, held blind faith bipartisanship, even Republicans voted bloc legislation. He is, perhaps, ill-suited respects era bruising political warfare. His advisers clearly reinforced inclinations. In campaign, fashioned outsider candidate "hope" "change" extended strategy presidency itself. They see standing party. In meeting congressional leaders last April, senior adviser David Axelrod rejected complaint Obama accorded equal blame Democrats Republicans descriptions "cynical politics Washington." Within White House, top aides still speak promoting Obama "brand." Organizing America, administration's campaign organization, supposed focusing 2010 elections, recently devoted resources organizing parties across country celebrate Obama's forty-ninth birthday. These efforts elevate Obama hurly-burly Washington politics disastrous. Obama's image iconic outsider become screen Fox News, Tea Party, radicalright bloggers, assorted politicians projected image foreigner, Islamic radical, socialist. He remained "the other" aspired campaign, advisers longer control otherness defined. The White House cabinet officials appointed reinforced aversion populism. As Jonathan Alter recounts The Promise: President Obama, Year One, Geithner Summers repeatedly blocked attempts get tough Wall Street grounds would threaten recovery upsetting bankers. For first year, Alter writes, "Obama bought Geithner-Summers argument banks fragile couldn't confronted remained peril." Its reluctance come bankers crippled administration politically, making far difficult get way Congress second stimulus program would boosted recovery Democrats' political prospects. Bad politics trump good policy. Populism profound shortcomings worldview. It tends toward demagoguery. In relentless focus middle class, ignore stigmatize it. It prove hostile long-range scientific outlook. A populist Obama, instance, might postponed battle climate change legislation national health insurance probably would taken weaker stand immigration. But populism indelible part American political psyche, uncomfortable making populist appeals, like Hoover Carter—or, recently, presidential candidate John Kerry—suffer consequences polls. If Obama's politics leads Republican takeover one houses Congress, even Republican president 2012, much Obama accomplished could undone.

The direct negotiations Israel Palestinians preconditions - dictated Israel.

The games purportedly held "without preconditions," every team put best players court aimed win. But unsurprisingly, Shin Ben security service permitted seven Palestinian players, including bench players, enter Israel. Some key players team compelled stay home. After several losses (by 30 40 points), Palestinians turn face team one Israeli colleges, coach announced decided spare players another humiliation, requested game canceled. The illuminating movie "Friendship Games," shown tonight Yes Docu channel (directed Ram Levy, along Ibtisam IVIara'ana, Duki Dror Yoav Shamir), documents tournament, initiative Ed Peskowitz, American Jew co-owner Atlanta Hawks basketball team NBA.

But Israel's success negotiations, like success student team tournament, measured terms "victory" "defeat."

Rage 1:1 Days Rage -- The Noxious Transformation Conservative Movement Rabid Fringe By Max Blumenthal, Nation Books Posted August 10, 2010, Printed August 17, 2010 http://www.alternet.orgistory/147784/ Editor's Note: The following new epilogue Max Blumenthal's book, Republic Gomorrah, paperback (Basic/Nation Books, 2009). "He tell wants strong authority take crushing responsibility thinking Since Republic weak, led break law love obedience. But really strong authority wishes? In reality demands rigorous order others, disorder without responsibility." -- Jean-Paul Sartre, "Anti-Semite Jew" I sure I first detected noxious fumes would envelop conservative movement Obama era. It might early on, April 2009, I visited series gun shows rural California Nevada. Perusing tables piled high high- caliber semi-automatic weapons chatting anyone vicinity, I heard urgent warnings mass roundups, concentration camps, socialist government Washington. "These people purchasing guns people worried what's going country," gun dealer told outside show Reno. "Good luck Obama," young gun enthusiast remarked me. "We outnumber 100 1." At time, Tea Party movement even registered national media's radar. In September 2009, I led panel discussion book inside auditorium filled nearly 100 students faculty University California- Riverside. Beside sat Jonathan Walton, African-American professor religious studies prolific writer, Mark Takano, erudite, openly gay former Democratic congressional candidate local community college trustee. In middle discussion, dozen College Republicans stormed front stage signs denouncing "left-wing hack" hysterical young man leaped crowd, blowing kisses mockingly Takano heckling Walton "racist." Afterward, university police officers insisted escorting ride right-wing heckler attempted follow shouted threats. Who stalker? Just concerned citizen worried taxes? His name Ryan Sorba operative heavily funded national conservative youth outfit, Intercollegiate Studies Institute. Besides founding dozens Republican youth groups across country, Sorba devoted exceptional amount energy interest homosexuals. His intellectual output consists tract titled The Born Gay Hoax, arguing homosexuality curable disease bogus trend manufactured academic leftists. Adding credentials, Sorba history run-ins law, explained I called order. My encounter aggressive right-wing cadre seemed strange, isolated event. But hostility turned symptomatic intensifying campaign delegitimize President Obama allies Congress. The Right's days rage beginning. Through first year office, Obama seemed oblivious threat far right. He campaigned partisanship, declaring "no red states" "conservative America." Apparently, thought merely contrivance myth people rejected science, demonized gays, assailed minority women's rights -- genuinely believed said. Speaking changing Washington, Obama seemed think entire history politics since rise Reagan Right strategies polarization deeply rooted superficial problem attributable certain "divisive" personalities, easily wiped away gestures toward bipartisanship. His view parties simply mirror images sharing fundamental beliefs separated "partisans." The skilled devoted community organizer could bring together. Many supporters media, often part parcel political wars years, reinforced amplified innocence, proclaiming one last could "bridge• partisan divide." Andrew Sullivan, disaffected conservative called critics George W. Bush policies "fifth columnists" fervently supporting Obama, wrote new president destined become "a liberal Reagan reunite America." This optimism pervaded Obama White House president aides sought Republicans willing vote programs. After all, couldn't get along? In autobiographical book The Audacity Hope, Obama highlighted key component political strategy: "I serve blank screen people vastly different political stripes project views." Once elected, conservatives concluded could reverse Obama's strength transforming human tableau fearsome images could conjure. Obama's multiracial background crucial cultivating resentment among shock troops. Those rejected Obama's legitimacy serve president basis background gave birth "Birther" movement sought challenge citizenship. The movement's visible figure, therefore eccentric, Orly Taitz, dentist self- trained lawyer immigrated former Soviet republican Moldova Israel settling conservative bastion Orange County, California. Convinced claims far-right Web site WorldNetDaily Obama planned create "civilian national security force," Taitz told "realized Obama another Stalin--it's cross Stalinist USSR Hitler's Germany." After becoming transfixed online conspiracy theories claiming Obama's family forged birth certificate Hawaii, Taitz snapped action. She filed lawsuit November 2008 California Secretary State Debra Bowen demanding investigation Obama's eligibility serve president. Taitz's plaintiff case Wiley Drake, Orange County radio preacher former second vice president Southern Baptist Convention publicly prayed Obama's death. While lawsuit went nowhere, subsequent suits earned angry rebukes judges, Taitz became instant media sensation, delivering heavily accented screeds Obama friendly interviewers Sean Haimity CNN's Lou Dobbs, Taitz called "greatest supporter" eventually fired indirect result hosting her. In March 2009, Texas Rep. Randy Neugebauer signed Birther bill proposing future presidential candidates must prove citizenship becoming eligible campaign. The Birther movement found voice goverment made indelible impact Republican grassroots. By June 2009, 28 percent Republican respondents Kos/Research 2000 poll said thought Obama wasn't born United States, 30 percent "weren't sure." "Obama Big House," Taitz shrieked me, "not White House!" When Obama announced health care reform first major initiative administration, conservative movement activated campaign demonization -- transformational politics -- designed turn Obama "Other," making seem unfamiliar, therefore threatening, possible. When president urged Congress deliver health care reform bill 2009, Right staged living theater political hatred, Obama's dream bipartisanship transformed nightmarish version "Marat/Sade." On September 12, 2009, tens thousands far-right activists belonging loose confederation anti-government groups called Tea Party Patriots converged Washington's National Mall giant protest Obama health care plan. The date significant: Fox News's top- ranked talk show host Glenn Beck declared birth "9-12 Project" restore sense unity -- siege mentality -- Americans experienced September 11, 2001. But time, Obama -- Osama -- enemy. While covering rally, I witnessed sign sign declaring Obama greater danger America's security al- Qaida; demonstrators held images juxtaposed Obama's face images evildoers Hitler Pol Pot Bin Laden; others carried signs questioning Obama's status U.S. citizen. "We fight al-Qaida, can't kill Obama," said aging demonstrator. Another told me, "Obama biggest Nazi world," pointing placards fashioned depicting Obama House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi SS outfits. According another activist, Obama's agenda similar Hitler's: "Hitler took banking industry, not? And Hitler personal secret service police. [The community- organizing group] ACORN extension that." The seemingly incongruous Tea Party propaganda recalled signs waved right-wing Jewish settlers rallies Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin support peace process, portraying SS officer French collaborator Marshall Petain. In 1995, amid provocative atmosphere, young right-wing Jewish zealot assassinated Rabin. The Israeli tragedy cautionary example targeted hatred leading violence. Members Tea Party "Patriots" seem care rhetoric irrational, comparing Obama Hitler Stalin contradictory obviously hyperbolic. Their motives entirely negative. By purging government multicultural evil seized power illicit means (several activists told believed ACORN helped Obama steal election), convinced mythical golden American yesteryear would return. They interest building anything new even articulating agenda, much less discussing merits policies. The Tea Party's primary concern cultural purification -- freedom from, freedom to. Against dark image president liberal allies, Tea Party activists defined children light. The racial subtext always transparent. The Tea Party's strategy rested guerrilla campaign chaos sabotage designed intimidate Democrats also disorient independent voters might supported health care reform. The Tea Partiers convinced would easy feat, since believed majority country side -- represented "Real America." At 9-12 rally Matt Kibbe, one march organizers, told crowd ABC News reporting 1 million 1.5 million people attendance, something ABC denied, saying "ABCNews.com reported approximate figure 60,000 70,000 protesters." Then Armey led crowd chant "Freedom works! Freedom works!" Unknown Tea Partiers, intoning name corporate-funded Beltway advocacy group, battle cry Mel Gibson William Wallace Braveheart. Contrary image grassroots movement mobilized stifle machinations Washington elites, Tea Party movement creation constellation industry-funded conservative groups close Republican ties. The movement's leading puppet-master Dick Armey, directed resources talking points Tea Party "Patriots" Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group, FreedomWorks. Among corporate clients Armey's lobbying firm, forced leave result involvement Tea Parties, pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb, company clear interest defeating health care reform. (Armey's "real American" clients included Marxist terror cult, People's Mojahedin Iran, received funding assistance Saddam Hussein order launch terrorist strikes throughout 1990's Iranian civilian targets.) Armey collected consulting fee $250,000 directly FreedomWorks $300,000 allied astroturf front groups. FreedomWorks paid much money assortment Republican political consultants. If Armey Tea Party king, Sarah PalM eager crowned Tea Party queen. Just days Obama's inauguration, Palin abruptly quit job Alaskan governor vie honor. PalM's motives quitting became clear inked lucrative deal write political memoir Going Rogue, signed regular contributor Fox News, received $1 million episode reality show cable television, "Sarah Palin's Alaska." PalM's book tour, sent Middle America luxuriously outfitted bus, resembled presidential campaign traveling carnival. Whether PalM intends run president, growing media presence magnified influence within Republican Party. Yet ever-expanding Palin phenomenon greeted hostility Republican politicos desperately seeking expand party's base drubbing 2008. Former McCain campaign manager Steve Schmidt warned Palin's nomination 2012 would "catastrophic" GOP. His doomsday prediction backed October Gallup poll revealing one polarizing unpopular political figures country disapproval rating 50 percent. Unfortunately Schmidt party pragmatists, approve Palin represent heartbeat Republican Party, fervent activists, cannot dissuaded following her, even leading party cliff. A November 2009 special congressional election New York's heavily Republican 23rd district first major test Palin's power. Along parade nationally recognized conservatives, Palin endorsed Doug Hoffman, unknown far- right third-party candidate closely allied Tea Party, helping force popular moderate Republican politician, Dede Scozzafava, race. In end, Palin's ideological purge upstate New York led improbable Democratic victory, first district 100 years. After disaster Palin allies claimed victory, insisting least hastened purge ideologically impure Republicans party. She went endorse Rand Paul, son right-wing libertarian Rep. Ron Paul candidate Kentucky's GOP senatorial primary, Dick Cheney went way endorse Rand's regular Republican opponent, Trey Grayson, Kentucky secretary state. Following Tea Party script avoiding social issues like abortion gay marriage order obscure large presence Christian Right within movement's ranks, self-described "hardcore pro- lifer" Palin recast libertarian concerned primarily issues "economic freedom." She claimed Democratic "cap trade" plan limit carbon emissions would harm livelihood blue-collar workers, assailed health care reform Trojan Horse "socialism" (though admitted family "used hustle border" take advantage Canada's single-payer health care system). But Palin attack much effect one blasted Facebook page claiming Obama health care plan included provision "death panels" would recommend euthanasia severely ill patients like Down syndrome-afflicted son, Trig. With click button, Palin transformed tone health care debate rancorous poisonous. The source Palin's "death panels" smear practiced propagandist, former New York Lieutenant Governor Betsy McCaughey. When President Bill Clinton introduced health care reform first term, McCaughey falsely claimed article published New Republic widely circulated Republicans, plan would force consumers drop private plans buy government's program (the article would go win National Magazine Award retracted years later New Republic's editors). Now back spotlight, pushing rumor would voted non-partisan fact-checking Web site Politifact.com "the lie 2009." McCaughey's latest innuendo boosted cult political crank Lyndon LaRouche, mobilized push rumor mainstream. In June 2009, one LaRouche's top lieutenants publicly confronted Ezekiel Emanuel, National Institute Health's chief bioethicist brother White House chief staff Rahm Emanuel, accusing seeking reintroduce Hitler's T- 4 program kill handicapped health care reform. "President Obama put place reform apparatus reviving euthanasia Hitler Germany 1939, began genocide there," LaRouche staffer Anton Chaitkin charged. Soon, LaRouche's followers street corners around country posters depicting Obama Hitler moustache. At town hall forum health care reform hosted Democratic Rep. Barney Frank, LaRouche follower waved one Obama-as-Hitler posters demanded, "Why continue support Nazi policy, Obama expressly supported policy?" Two months later, Palin whispered rumor Facebook, prominent conservatives former Speaker House Newt Gingrich ranking Senate Finance Committee member Charles Grassley parroted claims audiences indignant Tea Partiers. Not outdone, Glenn Beck devoted extended rant show reality death panels. Echoing LaRouche cultists, Beck accused Ezekiel Emanuel "the devaluing human life, putting price individual." He thundered, "The death panel firing squad. Rationing inevitable know it!" The death panel rumor served variety functions, useful movement, necessarily Republican Party. Most importantly, rumor resonated hard-core libertarians resented existence federal government Christian Right activists viewed legalization abortion slippery slope government-sponsored euthanasia. The hysteria engendered helped repair rift exposed Terri Schiavo charade 2005, evangelical conservative James Dobson publicly clashed Armey, libertarian leader, right government interfere private family matter life death. The slurring Obama sort sleeper agent crypto-Muslim helped bring neoconservatives back fray. The new neo- con generation led Dick Cheney's daughter, Liz, founded anti-Obama advocacy group, Keep America Safe, leveraging donations pro- Israel sources. Asked CNN's Larry King Birther movement challenging Obama's status American citizen, Liz Cheney remarked, "One reasons see people concerned people uncomfortable first time ever, I think, president seems reluctant defend nation overseas." With libertarians, Christian Right, neo-cons seated around table, united resentment alien president, conservative movement whole again. The experiments "Terror Management Theory" Sheldon Solomon, professor psychology Skidmore College, Jeff Greenberg, professor psychologist Unviersity Arizona, Tom Pyszczynski, professor psychology University Colorado, demonstrated connection fear death intensification conservative attitudes. The findings help explain effectiveness death panel rumor insinuations conservative figures Obama truly American somehow sympathetic Islamic terrorists. Indeed, seemingly irrational smears guided tactical reasoning, calculated agitate voters constant reminders mortality. Whether Independents responded, rhetoric death kept Tea Party crowd persistent state panic rage, ensuring standing army ready fan rallies town halls first sign liberal malfeasance. Obama's first year office marked raucous protests; several disturbing murders committed far-right extremists. In April 2009, 22-year-old neo-Nazi wannabe named Richard Poplawsi mowed SWAT team Pittsburgh cops, killing three. Poplawski's best friend told reporters young killer "grew angry recently fears Obama would outlaw guns." Later discovered Poplawski posted video clip neo-Nazi Web site portraying Fox's Glenn Beck contemplating existence concentration camps. (After characteristically thorough investigation, Beck conceded real.) On another occasion, killer posted video promoting Tea Party rallies. A month Pittsburgh bloodbath, Scott Roeder, supporter militant anti- abortion group Operation Rescue, shot Dr. George Tiller death prayed church Wichita, Kansas. Tiller declared fair game anti- abortion movement role Kansas's late-term abortion provider. During least 28 episodes Bill O'Reilly's "O'Reilly Factor," O'Reilly referred Tiller "Tiller baby killer," criminal guilty "Nazi stuff." "I wouldn't want [Tiller] Judgment Day," O'Reilly proclaimed. In August 2009, middle-aged professional named George Sodini walked health club suburban Pittsburgh gunned three women. The mainstream press explained Sodini's motives away homing passages online diaries describing loneliness, inability convince women sex him, descent chronic masturbation. Nearly every major media outlet omitted ignored long deranged entry Sodini projected sexual frustration onto Obama, seemed view symbol black male virility predation. The day Obama's election victory, Sodini wrote: "Good luck Obama! He successful. The liberal media LOVES him. Amerika chosen The Black Man. Good! In light I got ideas outside Obama's plans economy such. Here is: Every black man get young white girl ... Kinda reverse indentured servitude thing. Every daddy know sends little girl college, ... real good. I saw it. 'Not little girl', daddy says! (Yeah right!!) Black dudes thier [sic] choice best white?? [ellipses original]." In another posting anti- Clinton forum 1994, height Republicans' Whitewater investigation, Sodini revealed purchased bumper sticker reading, "Stop Socialism, Impeach Clinton," National Review ad. A year later, Sodini ranted anti-government militia site, "I convinced drastic action required bring country back Constitutional order 200 years ago. I don't think group political leaders achieve us." Whether Sodini's murder spree motivated political passions, pathologically death-driven fixated phantasmagoria right-wing imagery. In final diary entry, Sodini proclaimed, "Death lives!" More media figure Obama era, Glenn Beck encouraged campaign racial demonization conspiracy consumed Tea Party "Patriots." During broadcast "Fox Friends," Beck opined Obama "has exposed guy deep-seated hatred white people, white culture." As evidence, Beck pointed White House green-jobs czar Van Jones, African American former community organizer eventually forced resign direct result Beck's crusade. From there, Beck targeted another black Obama adviser, Valerie Jarrett, highlighting ties ACORN upholding Jones evidence Obama's "socialist" agenda. In another broadcast, Beck played audio clip unidentified African Americans referring "Obama money" collected welfare checks Detroit. Then showed footage members Kansas City-based youth group practicing step show, traditional African-American group dance apparently unfamiliar enough Beck transfixed audience felt liberty claim footage evidence "Obama's SS" trained across inner- city America. In September 2009, Beck relentlessly targeted ACORN, Right's new favorite hobgoblin, admitting intended use poor people's advocacy group distract viewers health care debate. "Trust me," Beck said, "Everybody says they're going talking health care. I don't think so." (His statement reminiscent Rush Limbaugh's scandal- mongering remark early Clinton administration: "Whitewater health care.") Beck promptly cued series hidden camera videos shot conservative youth activists James O'Keefe Hannah Giles inside ACORN field offices. In videos, O'Keefe baited African-American staffers making statements explaining Giles, claimed prostitute, could obtain low-income housing. O'Keefe edited images clad outlandish pimp costume create impression dressed way meetings ACORN; however, Giles later admitted partner lied wearing costume farther ineriminate ACORN. In end. ACORN exonerated criminal wrongdoing separate incident O'Keefe arrested charged federal crime several conservative pals disguised telephone repairmen attempted wiretap phone lines office Senator Mary 'Landrieu Louisiana. Like Ryan Sorba, O'Keefe posse movement cadres paid directed well-funded conservative outfits; O'Keefe trained Leadership Institute, right-wing youth Froup nurtured leadinG, lights like Jack Abriunoff, Karl Rove, Ralph Reed, Jeff Gannon. While O'Keefe buddies plea-bargained prosecutors, Beck basked formula success. His show earned hithest ratings Fox News, topping network franchises like O'Reilly Sean Hannity. In process. Beck's opinions became firmly implanted nervous systems Tea Party activists. "Glenn Beck taught us everything know," demonstrator 9-12 rally told Me. "He's opened eyes much." But unlike right-wing radio warhorses helped usher Newt Gin<trich's Republican counter-revolution 1994, Beck authentic product movement. When Rush Limbaugh first began dominating AM airwaves, Beck mired world mid-level commercial radio, delivering corny yarns lesbians celebrity trash hopes becoming next Howard Stem. By night, tirelessly recounted, medicated anxiety cocaine alcohol, destroying first marriage process. "We remember Glenn womanizing, drinking, drugs. Everybody knew time saw a: complete mess was," shock jock Tampa, Florida, called Bubba Love Sponge remarked broadcast nationally syndicated show. Like Dusty Rhodes, pseudo- populist demagogue Elia Kazan's 1957 film, A Face Crowd. Beck self- destructive drifter Who might crumpled bottle Mad Dog 20/20 alleyway locked away ,a prison cell fame found first. Beck able stabilize life made escape freedom., marrying conservative Mormon, converting religion, transmuting urge abuse drugs conservative radio diatribes. When Beck first broke television On CNN's Headline News Channel, struggled articulate coherent political world view. If distinguished big-time conservative .hosts way, strained often snide attempts humor, remnants failed radio career. Nevertheless, help liberal agent, Matthew Hiltzik, Beck snagged primetime slot Fox News early 2009. Around time, Beck began promoting work arcane Mormon conspiracy-peddler named W. Clean Skousen, described political lodestar. Suddenly, Beck something offer irritable mental gestures. Thanks Beck's designation Skousen's pseudohistorical tract The 5000 Year Leap "required reading" Web site 9- 12 Project, promotion book show, previously obscure Skousen. became Hidden imam Tea Party movement. By summer 2009, Skousen's Leap among top 10 books Amazon.com fixture literature tables Tea Party gatherings. It went selling puny couple thousand copies 2007 selling 200,000 copies 2009. Just book generated instant appeal difficult understand. It little slapdash quotes Founding Fathers, often taken context deliberately oversimplified, explain America greatest nation history. process, Skousen claims church state separation un-American, "coercive taxation" communist, marriage underpinning free society. Benjamin Franklin., wrote length merits "amours" "old women," famously solicited prostitutes fathered son wedlock, ultimate authority Skousen quoted importance marriage. Though Skousen claims Founders world's foremost source eternal wisdom, buttressed points fringe sources like conspiracist Norman Dodd's screeds Illuminati. According. Skousen, Dodd claimed "powerful influences congregating United States" like Rockefellers Rothschilds forced United States World War I. Skousen published Dodd's manifestoes obscure journal Freemen's Digest, founded express purpose propagating conspiracies. Skousen's paranoid politics outgrowth participation. extreme anti-communist groups 1950s. He boasted close friendship then-FBI director J. Edgar Hoover said provided research communist plots, claims disputed FBI historians. (During recent interview. Skousen's son, Paul, told contrary rumors Hoover's cross-dressing homosexual dalliances, would set top cop blind dates live women.) Skousen fired job Salt Lake City's police chief for, words city's conservative Mormon mayor, "conduct[ing] hi.s office chief police exactly manner communists operate government." From there, Skousen sailed far shores Right-peddling conspiracy tracts like The Naked Communist-, earning condemnation beloved FBI, accused internal memo "promoting [his] anti-communism obvious financial purposes." Skousen's vocal support far-right John Birch Society's claim communists controlled President Dwight Eisenhower cost support corporate backers paid Red-bashing lecture tours. He went radar several years, returning late 1960s accuse Jewish Rothschild family secretly bankrolling everyone Ho Chi Minh civil rights. movement. By late 1970s, even Church Latter Day Saints distanced Skousen conspiracy theories. His work fell margins might disappeared entirely Beck revived it, turning The 5000 Year Leap bible Tea Party movement. Journalist Alexander Zaitchik observed authoritative profile Skousen Salon.com Skousen's renewed influence Beck Tea Party 'suggests modern base Republican Party headed strange place." Besides influencing Beck, Skousen's teachings inspired one Tea Party movement's visible grassroots celebrities, retired Sheriff Richard Mack. I met Mack February far- right rally outside Montgomery, Alabama. On makeshift stage towed middle rodeo arena pickup truck, Mack recalled reverence mentorship Skousen, said taught everything needed know Constitution. Mack urged spellbound audience stockpile ammo store food. "If control food supply," Mack warned, "you control people. And that's first step slavery." Already hero conservatives successfully suing Clinton administration provision Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act requiring law enforcement conduct criminal background checks gun purchasers, Mack reemerged Obama era archetypal local lawman vowed resist tyrannical federal government. Along dozen former active military law enforcement personnel, Mack helped form self-styled Tea Party militia called Oathkeepers. Galvanized fear creeping socialism, Oathkeepers solemnly swore refuse tyrannical federal orders cooperating foreign troops forcing Americans concentration camps. Because group's members trained combat, vow came suggestion armed resistance. Besides Mack, Oathkeepers attracted coterie militia movement retreads ranks. The well-established figure Mike Vanderboegh, longtime militia fanatic published booklet mid- 1990s entitled Strategy Tactics Militia Civil War, calling sniper attacks "war criminals, secret policemen, rats." With Obama office, Vandeboegh churned anti- government screeds right-wing blogs renewed passion supported efforts cashing $1,300 federal disability compensation received month. For energy far right exerted campaign strangle Obama's agenda, Democrat posed greatest threat passage health care reform. Representative Bart Stupak Michigan office since 1993, placing among senior leadership so-called centrist Blue Dog Democrats. When health care reform introduced Congress, Stupak became leader informal caucus anti-abortion Democrats, making de facto swing vote House version bill. By extension, Stupak point man campaign ensure bill would allow federal funding abortion low-income women. But close consultation leaders U.S. Conference Catholic Bishops, Stupak went step further. He introduced draconian amendment block women paying abortions even private insurance plans. The amendment, passed House shut Senate, became key sticking point health care negotiations. 'He's big hero pro-life community," former Bush Catholic issues adviser Deal Hudson told November 2009. "Thanks him, first time I remember pro-life Democrats power." To chagrin Republicans, Stupak entertained offers compromise Democratic leadership. According Hudson, Catholic Bishops keen see health care reform pass, bill contained clear provision forbidding patients spending federal money abortion. Finally, March, pressure House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Obam.a agreed sign executive order forbidding federal funding abortion. Stupak mollified. Now anti- abortion caucus pledged deliver swing votes Democrats needed pass bill. As soon reports seeped declaring imminent passage health care reform, major right-wing blogs like RedState.org churned virulent denunciations Stupak, calling traitor sellout. The blog comment sections filled dozens diatribes referring Stupak language previously reserved Dr. George Tiller: "Bart Baby-Killer." On March 20, thousands Tea Party activists surrounded Capitol's Longworth Building expectation Obama's pep talk House Democrats health care vote. Democratic Representative john Lewis, hero civil rights movement, Representative Barney Frank, first openly gay member Congress, passed crowd way inside Capitol. Thsligger!" demonstrator barked Lewis. Another called Frank "faggot," eliciting laughter cheers nearby protesters. Meanwhile, another African-American Democrat, Representative Emanuel Cleaver, ascended Capitol steps, protester screaming Lewis Frank spat face. With demonstration carried night, cries "Kill bill!'' drifted calls violence. "I would gladly stand men take fascists down," man camouflage battle dress uniform proclaimed front amateur videographer, pointing toward Capitol. "You haven't heard last me!" The next day, Republican members Congress emerged Longworth Building salute Tea Partiers. The demonstrators cheered wildly proxies inside. Finally, hours impassioned speeches House floor, bill passed. But drama hardly over. Republican Representative Joe Pitts, anti-abortion Catholic co-authored Stupak's original amendment, demanded motion bring back floor vote, transparent exercise grandstanding certain fail. In response, Stupak rushed podium stinging rebuke Pitts Republicans. "The motion commit support life," Stupak declared. "It Democrats stood up...." Heckling Republican side interrupted statement. As Stupak looked around House chamber, Rep. Randy Neugebauer, right-wing Republican Texas openly supported Birther movement, began shouting backbench, "Baby killer!" Other Republicans joined in, parroting base insults. While Republicans sank heads defeat, militant devotees Tea Party movement called right-wing Kristallnacht. "If wish send message Pelosi party cannot fail hear, break windows," Vanderboegh Oathkeepers wrote far-right blog hours bill passed. "Break NOW. Break run break again." Within three days, windows doors Democratic Party headquarters New York, Kansas Arizona shattered. Meanwhile, least 10 Democratic members Congress reported receiving death threats. Images nooses faxed offices Stupak James Clyburn, African-American congressman South Carolina.

sbwhoeop Wednesday, August 18, 2010 9:18 AM H: Interesting relevant contribution debate interrelated jobs issue China policy. Go back proposals revival manufacturing sector, too. What Bill's program lm jobs mentioned? If won't listen, simply op-ed. Sid Does Thomas Friedman Have Talk "Senior Economic Policy Makers" Get So Many Things Wrong? Dean Baker co-director Center Economic Policy Research Washington, DC. Wednesday, 18 August 2010 04:04 Thomas Friedman begins oiece 1Q(44v telling readers that: "over past weeks I've chance speak senior economic policy makers America Germany." This might lead readers believe share great insights would possible someone special access senior economic policy makers. Readers expectation seriously disappointed. There nothing insightful found Washington Post's editorial pages average workday. Friedman rehashes usual cliches, usual lack thought. In so, gets story recent past present seriously wrong. Starting past, badly misrepresents prior business cycle: "we've ended decade debt-fueled growth borrowed money China give tax cut entitlements nothing curtail spending make long-term investments new growth engines." The main problem facing U.S. economy last decade lack demand. This large part due fact China lent us. China's lending policy propping value dollar order maintain export market United States. (At start decade, Clinton administration also tried promote over-valued dollar.) The over-valued -U.S. dollar made imports China countries cheap United States made exports expensive countries. This led large growing trade deficit business cycle. The trade deficit replaced domestic demand, preventing economy approaching normal levels employment (even boost housing bubble) crash. There reason whatsoever believe China's decision prop dollar way affected Bush tax cuts. In words, neither Bush tax cuts growth entitlements anything borrowing China. The issue China's decision lend thereby prop dollar. Given weakness demand decade, expenses could easily filled domestic production without borrowing abroad. Friedman better shifts discussion past present. He refers businesses' reluctance hire result "unusual uncertainty," phrase attributed Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bemanke. Of course reluctance hire, simply lack demand labor. A reluctance hire would reflected increasing number hours per worker, employers sought meet demand labor working existing workforce hours. This happening. There modest uptick hours low point downturn, increase hours per worker certainly rapid recessions average workweek still far shorter every sector downturn. Later tells readers: "America's solvency inflection point coinciding technological one. Thanks Internet diffusion, rise cloud computing, social networking shift laptops desktops hand-held iPads iF'hones, technology destroying older, less skilled jobs paid decent wage faster pace ever spinning new skilled jobs pay decent wage require education ever." This great story -- social networking soaring, IPads everywhere -- Friedman evidence whatsoever development increased demand educated workers reduced demand less educated workers? If so, would place column present evidence. Otherwise, readers might think 4.7 percent unemployment rate college grads (nearly triple pre-recession level), coupled decline real wages decade, implies reduced demand labor highly educated workers well less educated workers. Friedman's proposed fix also seems bit wide mark. He insists: "There one way deal challenge: innovation stimulate new industries jobs pay workers $40 hour, coupled huge initiative train Americans win jobs global competitors. There way." We better hope another way. A wage $40 hour would put worker well 90th percentile wage distribution. Even double number jobs pay range -- incredible accomplishment -- happens 80 percent workforce? Friedman warns us challenge Europe getting Germany's past present wrong: "Keeping Germany won't easy. A decade ago Germany 'sick man Europe.' No more. The Germans pulled together. Labor gave wage hikes allowed businesses improve competitiveness worker flexibility, government subsidized firms keep skilled workers job downturn." Germany clearly done sorne changes benefited economy, like work sharing, haven't, past "sick man Europe" invention Friedman highly placed sources. Germany always ran trade surplus. That basic measure country's competitiveness: foreigners buying goods. Germany's unemployment rate 2.000 ayeravd 7 .,5_percept, hugely different current 7.0 percent rate. The story Friedman seems completely missed basics current economic crisis spite weeks conversing senior economic policy makers. The current crisis due lack demand pure simple. If generate demand either expansionary Fed monetary policy, greater fiscal stimulus, increased exports due falling dollar, reason believe economy return high levels employment. Certainly Friedman presented evidence increased demand generate increased employment always has. The longer term debt problem overwhelmingly health care story. Apparently Mr. Friedman's sources don't access documents like Medicare trustees report, imply U.S. health care costs controlled serious long-term deficit problem. This may prove -Wrong, seems would least worth noting column. Of course, fixed health care system, always achieve huge saving retyinq efficient health care systems countries. If Friedman's intention scare us, succeeded. After all, senior economic policy makers U.S. Germany badly misinformed Friedman implies, expect times ahead.

Sid http://www.newstatesman.com/asia/2010/08/india-pakistan-afghanistan iNT aLOSE The military mullahs William Dalrymple Published 23 August 2010 The Pakistani state long history nurturing jihadis means dominating Afghanistan undermining India. It proving fatal alliance. It May nightmarish year Pakistan pretty good one country's inscrutable chief army staff, powerful man Land Pure, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. For start, army's response floods compared well usual corrupt incompetence Pakistan's civilian politicians, guided chateau-hopping president, Asif Ali Zardari (while minister investment, nicknamed "Mr 10 Per Cent"; upgraded "Mr 110 Per Cent"). This led discussion army circles whether time drop civilian fig leaf return country loving embrace military. So serious threat, one country's senior well-connected journalists. Najam Sethi, editor-in-chief Friday Times, went record month warn elements army plotting yet another coup."( know definitely discussed," said. Then news Kayani going allowed keep job second term: "an extraordinary situation requires extraordinary decision overcome it", explained brigadier, writing Nation newspaper. Kayani, former head Pakistan's notorious intelligence agency, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISO, continue run army, default Pakistan's foreign policy, November 2013. But Kayani's biggest triumph year, arguably greatest career, visit Kabul July honoured guest Afghan president, Hamid Karzai. The visit marked important thawing Pak-Afghan relations, glacial ever since Karzai came power 2001. It also coincided sacking Amrullah Saleh, Karzai's pro-Indian rabidly anti-ISI former security chief. Saleh tough Tajik rose prominence mujahedin protege Ahmed Shah Massoud, Indian-backed "Lion Panjshir". The Taliban, sponsors ISI, regarded Saleh fiercest opponent, something Saleh enormously proud of. When I dinner Kabul May, spoke length frustration ineffectiveness Karzai's government taking fight Taliban, extent ISI managing aid, arm train puppet insurgents North Waziristan Balochistan. Saleh's sacking gave notice important change direction Karzai. As Bruce Riedel, Barack Obama's Af-Pak adviser, said news broke, "it means Karzai already planning post-American Afghanistan". • It seems Kayani Karzai discussing sort accommodation Afghan government ISI- sponsored elements Taliban, maybe Sirajuddin Haqqani, could give much Pashtun south pro-Pakistan Taliban, preserve Karzai power Kabul US withdrawal. The expulsion India, Pakistan's great regional rival, Afghanistan, least closing four regional consulates, would top priority ISI return deal kept Karzai power. With US toppling Taliban 11 September 2001 attacks, Pakistan's influence disappeared abruptly Afghanistan India quickly filled vacuum. To ISI's horror, early years decade, India provided reconstruction assistance training worth roughly £835m total. It also built roads, sanitation projects, new Afghan parliament free medical facilities across country. It even offered help train Afghan army. Nato refused. As General Stanley McChrystal put report last year, "while Indian activities largely benefit Afghan people, increasing Indian influence Afghanistan likely exacerbate regional tensions encourage Pakistani countermeasures". McChrystal right. The Pakistanis always paranoid small Indian presence Afghanistan. "We strong evidence [that India is] using Afghanistan Pakistan's interests destabilise Pakistan," foreign ministry spokesman claimed March. Pakistan's military establishment, terrified economic superpower emerging south, believes would suicide accept Indian presence regards Afghan backyard - potential point retreat army event Indian invasion, something Pakistani analysts refer vital "strategic depth". According Indian diplomatic sources, still fewer 3,600 Indians Afghanistan; ten Indian diplomatic officers, opposed nearly 150 UK embassy. Yet horror encircled led ISI risk Pakistan's relationship main strategic ally, US, order keep Taliban play leadership ISI patronage Quetta - policy Kayani developed head IS!. Karzai's new deal Pakistanis, clear intention try reach accommodation proxies among Taliban, therefore represents major strategic victory Kayani Pakistan's military, well grave diplomatic defeat India. Pakistan's support Taliban today recent chapter old story complicity jihadi movements Pakistani state. Since days anti-Soviet mujahedin, Pakistan's army saw violent Islamic groups ingenious cost-effective means dominating Afghanistan (which finally achieved retreat Soviets 1987) bogging Hindu-dominated Indian army Kashmir (which managed great effect 1990 onwards). The former ISI director Dick Dastardly lookalike Hamid Gul, largely responsible developing strategy, said me: "If jihadis go contain India, tying one rnillion men army soil, legitimate cause, support them?" Next Gul Islamabad living room lay piece Berlin Wall presented city's people "delivering first blow" Soviet empire use jihadis 1980s. The WikiLeaks documents suggest still busy liaising jihadis "retirement". The Pakistani military top brass long convinced could control militants nurtured. In taped conversation President Pervez Musharraf Muhammad Aziz Khan, chief general staff, India released 1999, Aziz said army jihadis "tooti" (balls). Yet Islamists increasingly followed agendas, sending suicide bombers Pakistan's religious minorities political leaders, even IS! headquarters. Nonetheless, many army still believe jihadis practical defence Indian hegemony nuclear weapons. For them, supporting Islamist groups ideological religious whim, much practical patriotic imperative - vital survival strategy Pakistani state. The army ISI continued duplicitous risky policy 11 September 2001 despite Musharrafs public promises contrary. The speed US lost interest Afghanistan invasion embarked plans invade Iraq convinced Pakistani army Washington long-term commitment Karzai's regime. This led generals keeping Taliban reserve, used reinstal pro-Pakistani regime Kabul American gaze turned elsewhere. So .ISI gave refuge leadership Taliban fled Afghanistan 2001. Mullah Mohammed Omar kept IS! safehouse Quetta; militia lodged sprawling suburb Pashtunabad. There, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar presided Taliban military committee war chest. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, leader Hizb-e-lslami, lured back exile Iran allowed operate freely outside Peshawar, Jalaluddin Haqqani, one violent Taliban commanders, given sanctuary North Waziristan. Other groups despatched safehouses Balochistan. By 2004, US filmed Pakistani army trucks delivering Taliban fighters Afghan border recovering days later; wireless monitoring US base Bagram picked Taliban commanders arranging Pakistani army officers border safe passage came Afghanistan. Western intelligence agencies concluded ISI running full training programme Afghan Taliban, turning blind eye raised funds Gulf allowing import materiel, mainly via Dubai. By 2005 Taliban, covert Pakistani support, launching full-scale assault Nato troops Afghanistan given covering fire returned bases Pakistan. At time, Taliban attacks Indian interests Afghanistan intensified, beginning process turning Afghan conflict, like Kashmir, today: lndo-Pak proxy war. The Indian embassy Kabul twice bombed - July 2008 October 2009 - two city-centre hotels thought used Research Analysis Wing (Raw), Indian intelligence agency. Seven Indian civilians two Indian military officers died blasts. The degree ISI controlling Afghan Taliban become clear, documents published WikiLeaks. A report Matt Waldman Carr Centre Human Rights Harvard, based interviews ten former senior Taliban commanders, closely documents IS! "orchestrates, sustains strongly influences" Taliban shows !SI even represented Taliban's supreme leadership council, Quetta Shura. Meanwhile, Punjab, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, founder Lashkar-e-Toiba, man believed behind 2008 Bombay attacks, allowed continue operating Muridke, near Lahore. "The powerful western world terrorising Muslims," told conference Islamabad year. "We invaded, manipulated looted. We must fight evil trio America, Israel India. Suicide missions accordance Islam. In fact, suicide attack best form jihad." At time Pursuing policy selectively using jihadis, Pakistan appeased US giving generous assistance CIA arresting foreign Arab al-Qaeda personnel. A major assault also launched militants took Lal Masjid ultra-radical Pakistan Taliban took Swat Valley announced intention turning country Islamic Emirate. In course operations others Federally Administered Tribal Areas, 1,500 Pakistani soldiers policemen killed; another 250,000 people made homeless Pak army assault Bajaur. The IS1 even prepared arrest members Afghan Taliban didn't follow orders. Hence seizure Karachi, February, Taliban second-in- command, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, along aboutia dozen senior Taliban ISI regarded infringing hospitality opening talks Karzai administration via Saudis, without ISI clearance. Yet, even though Pakistani army conducted major offensives six tribal areas, seventh, North Waziristan, left alone, home ISI's favourite proxies: Haqqani Hekmatyar. Similarly, Pakistan's foot-dragging response 2008 attacks Bombay, lack response attacks minority faith groups Pakistan past months, show Janus-faced policy remains place. This summer, chief minister Punjab, Shahbaz Sharif, quoted heatedly denying militant groups working Pakistani Punjab, Punjabi Taliban even existed. There still, eyes many Pakistani establishment, good Taliban bad Taliban, useful militants expendable ones. In eyes, ongoing defeat Nato Afghanistan, US British troops suffering record casualties last month, vindication long-term strategy. Islamabad succeeded regaining influence Afghanistan Delhi checked. But India take lying down. Already Indian press reported attempts - resuscitate Northern Alliance contingency Taliban's takeover south, India working conjuction Russia, Iran central Asian "stans". The Indian national security adviser, Shivshankar Menon, despatched Afghanistan March, foreign minister, S M Krishna, visited Tehran. Post-American Afghanistan looking increasingly likely divided Tajik, Uzbek Hazara north Pashtun south, either formally, partition, likely, slip inter-ethnic civil war, India supporting arming north Pakistan south. As diplomacy gathers pace, Afghan Taliban, already control 70 per cent country. continue increase power. The worrying development spread Taliban units previously peaceful north, taken pockets Pathan settlement around Kunduz Badakhshan. The death British aid worker Karen Woo 5 August direct result. In Pakistan. too, jihadi activity growing. Last year 87 suicide attacks across country, killing roughly 3,000 people ISI week stated that, first time nation's history, regarded home-grown Islamic militants bigger threat integrity nation India. Yet army continues obsess India. In recent speech, Kayani emphasised although army knows dangers militancy, Indian attacks principally focused. At time Pakistan's economy crisis, electricity supply increasingly erratic educational system complete breakdown, Kayani secured huge increase country's defence budget. It pretty picture: growing violence everywhere, increasing Indo-Pak tensions defeat western interests region. Worst all, Pakistani army regards major triumph, unlikely change policy time soon.

OLUMNISTS JVlartin Wolf Obama cautious fearful times By Martin Wolf Published: Au• ust 31 2010 22:48 j Last updated: August 31 2010 22:48 Suppose US presidential election 1932 had, fact, taken place 1930, early stage Great Depression. Suppose, too, Franklin Delano Roosevelt won then, though landslide 1932. How different subsequent events might been. The president might watched helplessly output employment collapsed. The decades Democratic dominance might happened. On chances wheel history turns. But time different: crisis brought Barack Obama power close beginning economic collapse. I (among others) argued policy needed hugely aggressive. Alas, not. I noted February 4 2009, beginning new presidency: "Instead overwhelming fiscal stimulus, emerging small, wasteful ill-focused." A week later, I asked: "Has Barack Obama's presidency already failed? In normal times, would ludicrous question. But normal times. They times great danger. Today, new US administration disown responsibility inheritance; tomorrow, it. Today, offer solutions; tomorrow become problem. Today, control events; tomorrow, events take control it. Doing little far riskier much." This right. The direction policy wrong: policymakers — though economists — learnt great deal 1930s. Sensible people knew aggressive monetary fiscal expansion needed, together reconstruction financial sector. But, Larry Summers, Mr Obama's chief economic adviser, said: "When markets overshoot, policymakers must overshoot too". Unfortunately, administration failed follow excellent advice. This allowed opponents claim policy ineffective merely inadequate. In consequence, administration lost credibility public chances renewed fiscal expansion disappeared. With Federal Reserve cautious, too, likelihood lengthy period weak growth heavy joblessness high. So, too, chances domestic global political friction. True, idea policies adopted last months Bush administration first months one far better nothing weirdly controversial US. A recent paper Alan Blinder, former vice-chairman Fed, Mark Zandi Moody's argues critics wrong. They use standard macro-economic model assess would happened without intervention, without financial interventions (including monetary policy) without fiscal action. They conclude peak trough decline gross domestic product would close 12 per cent policy response, compared actual decline 4 per cent (see chart). Similarly, unemployment rate would peaked 16.5 per cent, instead actual 10 per cent. The bigger collapse would also meant fiscal deficit $2,600bn fiscal year 2011. The outcome also disastrous modest fiscal response financial •olic res•onse. It little better way round. The implication modest stimulus package February 2009 — mere 5.7 per cent 2009 GDP, spread several years — made positive contribution supported analysis Congressional Budget Office: argues 2010, US GDP 1.5 per cent 4.1 per cent higher unemployment rate 0.7 1.8 percentage points lower, result package. Panglossians believe private economy always equilibrium, unless governments intervene, disagree. I wish way run experiment without hurting hundreds millions people. But I find idea allowing collapse much financial system, avoiding unconventional monetary policy struggling close fiscal deficit would consistent rapid sustained recovery quite bizarre. A fascinating perspective come, however, comparisons happened advanced countries. The recession US output (and demand) relatively small, decline employment exceptionally large, result extraordinary surge US productivity (see charts). This contrast would happen output would happen employment missed initial Congressional Budget Office analysis stimulus. Since US epicentre financial crisis, relatively small decline output remarkable. Moreover, since fiscal monetary stimuli bear directly demand output, jobs, policy success. At time, enthusiasm US managers laid workers also extraordinary. No doubt, due collapse construction. But must due ease US companies lay workers incentives managers maintain profits downturn expense jobs. Debate emerging much surge unemployment structural. My answer, European experience, one way ensure becomes structural let linger. In short run, simplest way prevent happening expand demand output. Since huge slack labour market, slightest threat inflation — far risk deflation — constraint bond foreign exchange markets monetary fiscal stimulus, policies pursued. Yet, alas, Fed seems decided fall asleep administration lost initiative. So going happen? I assume that, midterm elections, resurgent Republicans offer new tax cuts ignore fiscal deficits. They pretend nothing reviled stimulus, though much thing — increasing fiscal deficits, thereby offsetting private frugality. That would put administration spot. It would choose vetoing tax cuts accepting them, allowing Republicans get credit "yacht mansion-led" recovery. Any recovery better none. But could much better this.

The political brain Americans today reflects volatile mixture fear fury, mix together, get explosion. The question point mitigate damage bomb detonates November. The bad news it's late Democrats would good policy good politics (and House actually do), namely pass major jobs bill clear private sector couldn't keep Americans employed. The "Obama Doctrine" Americans want work ability contribute productivity nation right work, private sector can't meet demand jobs, plenty roads bridges fix, new energy sources develop manufacture, schools build renovate kids workers returning training compete 21st century global economy. From spent much last four years testing messages range issues, immigration taxes deficits, I say certainty nothing John Boehner Eric Cantor could say could come within 30 points generating enthusiasm -- particularly among swing voters -- message began, "We don't shortage work ethic country, shortage work." That message resonates across political spectrum. And isn't even strongest message we've tested last weeks months beats back toughest deficit-cutting language side muster. But it's late that. The administration opted alternative doctrine, Larry Summers enunciated This Week several months ago: unemployment going remain high foreseeable future eventually come -- there's nothing -- push small symbolic measures whose symbolism tends escape people work. It's hard excited symbolism children hungry bank repossessing home -- although didn't anything deserve -- people making like bandits. Although situation looks bleak Democrats November, ain't 'til it's over. Republicans shooting foot country, running Tea Party candidates far right can't see Middle America porch. And endangered Democrats likely see victory November understand public mood speak it. What public mood? It characterized single phrase -- populist anger -- cuts across partisan lines. On right, alloyed racial anxiety prejudice. On left, alloyed tremendous disappointment could kind bold leadership times like cry out. And among people vast political center, populist anger alloyed anxiety uncertainty -- jobs, homes, children's future. How Create Populist Explosion: A Tragedy Two Acts So get here? The story told tragedy two acts. Act I: The GOP Sets Country Course Economic Destruction President Calls Truth Reconciliation without Truth Part • A strong economic downturn devolves Great Recession, stock market crashes major banks fail. By October 2008, upper middle class moderate Republicans suburbs frightened what's happening assets they're willing give Democrats chance. • A Republican administration believes neither government regulation creates 700 billion bank bailout accountability. Unlike Republicans, would say "no" situation like let Great Recession turn Great Depression, Democrats right thing, don't make clear start Bush Bailouts remind Americans, over, cause bankruptcies bankruptcy Republican ideology. • A charismatic young president raises people's hopes expectations, uniquely can. Americans frightened, willing waiting hear alternative narrative "government problem, solution" path back economic recovery security. • The White House refuses tell American people three stories desperately need hear. • The first economy gone ditch, it. The president steadfast position "look forward, backward," even GOP blocking every initiative clean mess. As conservative attacks Democrats increase, refuses indict Republicans Congress President Bush destroyed economy putting one eight Americans work one five either behind mortgage process homes foreclosed bankers gambled away. Why need tell American people responsible misery -- repeat again? Because otherwise, worst economic crisis since Great Depression didn't subside within year half, voters would start associate party. This Neuroscience 101 - - it's mental associations formed. But president never even uttered George W. Bush's name first year office, first time mention Bush appoint him, along former President Clinton, co-lead American relief efforts Haiti. The president doesn't like putting antagonists stories, forced to, would cite unnamed "naysayers," "Washington politics usual," "Congress," counterproductive given Congress held party. The guiding belief White House implicit messaging strategy Americans good grasp economics good memories: • The second story American people needed hear president deficit spending essential economy spiraling downward. It's hard story tell, even sound bite. But one best educators occupy Oval Office decades chose educate -- actually once, prodding, never repeated superb explanation --- remind voters every time opponents attacked deficit spending left 1.2 trillion dollar deficit day walked office unpaid-for tax cuts millionaires unpaid-for war Iraq called one sacrifice except soldiers families (and kids grandkids, paying war generations). A year later, Democrats ropes, president started tell story. It right move, appeared defensive hadn't part guiding narrative start. • The third story president needed offer alternative narrative government. The president party offer effective government solution multiple problems 30 years solid branding conservatives since Ronald Reagan government problem. But narrative never came. • The White House Democratic Congress pass virtually economists outside Goldman Sachs-to- Washington pipeline consider half-stimulus predict likely produce half-results. It fulfilled promise. But equally predictable political result discrediting concept government intervention stimulate economy eyes public -- enough scare Democratic lawmakers learned Keynesian economics intro economics indefinite future. Instead blasting Republicans hurled country toward abyss would take drastic measures avert warning American people could easily first two three trillion-dollar packages might needed get Americans back work get gears economy grinding could start returning kinds surpluses Bill Clinton left last time Democrat White House, president chose compromise party unpopular took office 20 percent voters point would even admit pollster considered Republicans -- lowest point GOP since rise public opinion polling 50 years earlier. • The economy continues free-fall, shedding 700,000 jobs month. Meanwhile, Democrats don't take kind dramatic steps necessary stop bleeding. Americans becoming desperate, remain hopeful new president turn things around, perhaps jobs provisions new "stimulus" act cauterize wound. Meanwhile, stimulus portrayed Republicans mixture pork fat, one effectively answering charges, creating increasingly negative associations act never adequately crafted sold. • The logical follow-up bill designed pull economy ditch make bill unnecessary future, attacking Wall Street thrown us crisis passing strong legislation rein excesses created economic meltdown. This would sealed American people's loyalty new president Congress. (Heading November, is, fact, popular piece legislation Democrats passed, took nearly year half get there, then, neither president Democratic Congress enjoyed good average American.) Instead, banks received bailouts foreclosing record rates homeowners whose payroll taxes funded bailouts don't seem get kind attention needs federal government. Adding insult injury, banks double triple credit card interest rates high 30 percent, including people's existing credit card debt -- continuing receive no-interest loans federal government. • Despite talk accountability, one fired (except one auto executive), virtually one prosecuted even investigated far anyone knows, banks received bailouts flaunt record bonuses. Act II: An Anemic Economy Meets Anemic Health Care Plan • The public clamoring health care reform. Over 40 million people don't health insurance all, 85 percent voters health care seen costs double Bush years time real income declined. Effective narratives health care widely available win 2:1 margin toughest Harry-and-Louise anti-reform language side. The opposition knows it, evident leaked memo Republican wordsmith Frank Luntz, warns uphill climb opponents reform, would well accept major elements it. • But instead using well-tested narratives highly effective campaign devising new ones own, administration decides try "sell" health care without narrative. (I wrote detail year ago repeat history here, except telegraphic form.) The president refuses state stands substantive debates health reform year, whether "public option" (a term ill-conceived it's hard believe public supported anyway; imagine support might received called instead "the one health care plan health insurance companies don't get control"). Instead, White House uses phrases "bending cost curve" conservatives flood airwaves evocative phrases "government takeover," "a bureaucrat doctor," "death panels." • Instead using Big Pharma health insurance industry villains health care story, would explain need overhaul rather Band-Aid, White House offers story without protagonists antagonists, cuts secret deals industries become public. • Over interminable months trying get votes Republicans fought Medicare seniors 30 years program popular keep attacking still trying gut Social Security despite popularity, public watches George Will describes "serial bribery" Republican Democratic Senators alike, gets take turn 60th vote. • At 11th hour, compromise plan finally going pass, president nixes idea Medicare-like alternative Americans choose health-insurance industry plan desire, despite 60 percent even swing voters wanting included bill. • Instead signature bill demonstrates Democrats govern effectively government force good working middle class Americans (who told better plans they've negotiated offered years employers "Cadillacs" going taxed existence), entire process proves average American government can't anything right scares moderate Democrats away voting bill would ever put record supporting government spending. • "Government" hits all-time low polls, matching popularity big corporations, CEOs, bailouts. • Populist anger emerges primary emotion across political spectrum, president's job approval swing voters drops high thirties. • Following conventional wisdom, Democrats return all-too-familiar defensive crouch, conclude trouble, tack right. On health care, president Cabinet fan television "reassure" public health care abortion won't covered (thanks reassurance, us didn't find reassuring), domestic partners won't covered, immigrants won't covered. None issues needed conceded. (I know I tested messages them, well- messaged progressive positions would boosted popularity bill swing voters.) • The White House starts adopting failed conservative policies talking points leave public utterly confused president, extension, party, stands central issues day. The president talks cutting deficits increasing spending breath, using metaphor families tightening belt tough times, strengthens resolve stimulating faltering economy; pledges support massively expanding offshore drilling "clean coal" (which doesn't exist, way) speech climate change; sends 1200 additional National Guards Arizona apparent reward passing "No Latino Left Behind," publicly objecting legislation. • The underlying psychological assumption moves mix policies right left equal parts, win center. In fact, one ever won center way. It appears weak, opportunistic, incoherent average swing voter, particularly problematic time people center desperately want know leaders vision coherent plan (which FDR Ronald Reagan effective moving voters center). It doesn't win votes right. But one predictable effect: It sucks motivation base, feel demoralized betrayed (if they're part "professional left") less likely vote (if they're average voters don't follow politics carefully don't feel enthusiastic anymore, even don't really know why). • Capping off, BP disaster occurs two weeks president adopted "drill here, drill now," "all above" position Republican Party oil companies. This could perfect opportunity go offensive, contrast Democrats stand (common sense, protection safety, land leave children, key American industries jobs, sticking ordinary Americans big businesses lobbyists) Republicans stand for; connect dots happened Wall Street (with regulators owned operated companies supposed regulate) happened Gulf (where precisely thing happened). Instead, administration finds defensive, increasingly sounding like subsidiary BP, allowing BP call shots control information weeks, defending increasingly hard-to-believe statistics, issuing press releases appear indistinguishable issued BP inconsistent assessments independent scientists. Where Do We Go Here? So find today: Democratic Party Democratic base demoralized unlikely vote high numbers November; Republican Party selling replanted Bushes tremendous enthusiasm; vast political center filled voters utterly confused unsure turn certain things aren't going well. In January 2009 one could predicted Democrats would predicament today. Perhaps Democrats might lose seats lost off-year election, certainly that. We seen -- American public knew seen -- disastrous performance president party living history, American people elected tremendously charismatic young president enormous Democratic majorities houses Congress. They given president Congress strong mandate whatever kind change necessary get us economic free-fall put Americans back work. But red flags already end Obama's first week office led offer following advice new administration: Tell story got mess you'll it. Tell coherent story deficit spending. Re-brand government there's one story (Reagan's), it's one supports progressive agenda. Never let attacks go unanswered, emboldens opposition leads public believe answers them. And throw bipartisan party one comes, don't throw another one. All followed predictable unfortunate. A year half later, White House hasn't consistently done things, although President intermittently them, does, well. The question today whether Democrats channel populist anger seeing around country late game. The answer we'd better try. Having recently tested messages economics jobs, including talk deficits taxes -- widely assumed Democrats' Achilles Heel, particularly -- little question Democrats progressives center left simply say believe ways evocative, values-driven, speak people's worries 'anger, many stand good chance surviving November, particularly opponents nothing say warmed-over rhetoric cutting taxes millionaires multinationals fiscal restraint except cuts profits campaign contributors. Even evocative boilerplate conservative messages fall flat honest messages speak need get Americans working again. And issue issue, message resonant right one sides working middle class Americans small business owners special interests, big business, lobbyists. But actions speak louder words, Americans want see action. It may late kind jobs bill seen year half ago, isn't late Democrats go offensive Republicans - - virtually -- opposed extending unemployment insurance millions Americans thrown work Republicans' corporate sponsors. It isn't late Democrats contrast support highly popular aid state local governments saved jobs hundreds thousands teachers, firefighters, police country Republicans' desire throw onto street. It isn't late make voting issue bill Republicans stalling would give small businesses fighting chance economy stacked them, make clear one party stands small businesses, create 75 percent new jobs country, party stands big businesses outsource American jobs offshore profits avoid paying fair share American taxes. It's late pass bill would limit credit card interest rates reasonable percent rate credit made available credit card companies. It's late pass first badly need "fix" health care reform act demonstrate Americans Democrats mean say first step, namely law stops insurance companies increasing premiums 40 percent cutting size networks 50-75 percent, violates principles affordability choice essential efforts sell health care reform public. It's late vow change rules Senate prevent use filibuster give every special interest veto power every important piece legislation. It's late introduce legislation that's hold House Senate guarantee fair elections, voice everyday Americans heard voice special interests finance political campaigns. On every one issues, strong populist message trounces anything side say. But Democrats need play offense. They need take up-or-down votes bill bill, including expect side block, knowing every one votes leverage campaign ad behind it. They need change narrative sounds average American like whiny impotent one -- "the Republicans won't let us it" -- narrative strength numbers shared constituents. And need make every election choice two well-articulated approaches governance -- offer articulation sides' positions values. That leads final point. What Democrats needed offer American people clear narrative led country mess find today clear vision lead us out. That narrative would laid roadmap elected officials voters alike, rather making legislative issue seemingly discrete turn onto dirt road. That narrative might included -- include today -- key elements: economy tumbling, it's role leadership government stop free-fall; Wall Street gambling financial security, homes, jobs, true leaders sit back helplessly wax eloquent aboUt free market, take away dice; private sector can't create jobs people want work, we'll put Americans back work rebuilding roads, bridges, schools; Big Oil preventing us competing China's wind solar energy programs, we'll eliminate tax breaks lead dysfunctional investments 19th century fuels public-private partnership companies create clean, safe fuels 21st century millions good American jobs follow. That's Democrats stand for. It's time said it.

America's Faltering Search Peace Middle East: Openings Others? Remarks staff Royal Norwegian Ministry Foreign Affairs and, separately, members Norwegian Institute International Affairs Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.) 1 September 2010, Oslo, Norway You asked speak current American policies Middle East, emphasis prospects peace Holy Land. You suggested I touch relationship Gulf Arabs, especially Saudi Arabia, this. It honor challenge address subject capital / ministry. The declaration principles worked Oslo seventeen years ago last direct negotiation Israelis Palestinian Arabs reach consequential, positive results. The Oslo accords real step toward peace, another deceptive pseudo-event endlessly unproductive, so-called "peace process." And one step forward Oslo 1993 followed several steps backwards, great deal learned happened. There doubt importance today's topic. The ongoing conflict Holy Land increasingly disturbs world's conscience well tranquility. The Israel-Palestine issue began struggle context European colonialism. In post-colonial era, tension Israelis Palestinians dispossessed became, degrees, principal source radicalization instability Arab East Arab world whole. It stimulated escalating terrorism Israelis home allies abroad. Since end Cold War, interaction Israel captive Palestinian population emerged fountainhead global strife. It increasingly difficult distinguish strife war religions conflict civilizations. For better ill, country, United States played continues play key international part contest. American policies, external actor, capacity stoke stifle hatreds Middle East spread reverse infection wider world. American policies actions Middle East thus affect much region. Yet, I argue, United States obsessed process rather substance. It failed involve parties essential peace. It acted Israel's behalf preempt rather enlist international regional support peace. It defined issues ways preclude rather promote progress. Its concept "peace process" therefore become handmaiden Israeli expansionism rather driver peace. There alternatives tomorrow's diplomatic peace pageant Potomac. And, Norway shown, role powers America crafting peace Holy Land. Over thirty years ago, Camp David, Jimmy Carter pushed Israel door peace Egypt's Anwar Sadat opened. Twenty years ago, first Bush administration pressed Israel negotiating table Palestinian leaders, setting stage clandestine meetings Oslo. The capacity United States rally governments behind cause espouses may atrophied, American power remains far greater nation. Nowhere evident Middle East. For four decades, Israel able rely aid United States dominate region militarily sustain economic prosperity. It counted leverage American politics block application international law protect political repercussions policies actions. Unquestioning American support enabled Israel put seizure ever land ahead achievement modus vivendi Palestinians Arabs. Neither violent resistance dispossessed objections abroad brought successive Israeli governments question, let alone alter priority assign land peace. Ironically, Palestinians developed dependency relationship America. This locked political framework Israel exercises decisive influence. They powerless end occupation, pogroms, ethnic cleansing, humiliations Jewish soldiers settlers. Nor able prevent progressive confinement checkpoint-encircled ghettos West Bank great open-air prison Gaza. Despite appalling record failure, American monopoly management search peace Palestine remains unchallenged. Since end Cold War, Russia — contender countervailing influence region — lapsed impotence. The former colonial powers European Union, earlier laid basis conflict region, largely sat hands ringing them, content let America take lead. China, India, Asian powers prudently kept political military distance. In region itself, Iran postured exploited Palestinian cause without anything advance it. Until recently, Turkey remained aloof. On rare occasions, case 1973 Arab oil embargo, Arabs backed verbal opposition Israel action. Egypt Jordan settled unpopular coexistence Israel sustained U.S. subventions. Saudi Arabia twice taken initiative offer Israel diplomatic concessions conclude arrangements peaceful coexistence Palestinians. But, overall, Arab governments earned contempt Palestinians people lack serious engagement. For part, Arab leaders timorously demanded America solve Israel-Palestine problem them, obsequiously courting American protection Israel, other, Iran, — cases — increasingly frustrated angry subjects citizens. Islam charges rulers duty defend faithful uphold justice. It demands embody righteousness. The resentment mostly Muslim Arabs governing elites' failure meet standards generates sympathy terrorism directed Israel United States Arab governments associated it. The perpetrators September 11, 2001, terrorist attack United States saw part reprisal American complicity Israeli cruelties Palestinians Arabs. They justified strike Washington's protection Arab governments willing overlook American contributions Muslim suffering. Washington's response attack included suspending efforts make peace Holy Land well invading occupying Afghanistan Iraq. All three actions inadvertently strengthened terrorist case attacks America allies. The armed struggle Americans Muslim radicals already spilled Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, countries. Authoritative voices Israel call adding Iran list countries war America. They echoed Zionist neo-conservative spokesmen United States, The widening involvement Americans combat Muslim lands inflamed anti-American passions catalyzed metastasis terrorism. It caused growing majority world's 1.6 billion Muslims see United States menace faith, way life, homelands, personal security. American populists European xenophobes meanwhile undercut liberal centrist Muslim arguments intolerance empowers terrorism equating terrorism extremist advocates Islam followers. The current outburst bigoted demagoguery construction Islamic cultural center mosque New York merely recent illustration this. It suggests blatant racism Islamophobia contemporary Israeli politics contagious. It rules global alliances religious extremists essential encompass political defeat. President Obama's inability break pattern must enormous personal disappointment him. He came office committed crafting new relationship Arab Muslim worlds. His first interview international media Arab satellite television. He reached publicly privately Iran. He addressed Turkish parliament persuasive empathy. He traveled great center Islamic learning Cairo deliver remarkably eloquent message conciliation Muslims everywhere. He made clear understood centrality injustices Holy Land Muslim estrangement West. He promised responsible withdrawal Iraq judicious recrafting strategy Afghanistan. Few doubt Mr. Obama's sincerity. Yet none initiatives led policy change anyone detect, let alone believe It analyze explain wide gaps rhetoric achievement Obama Administration's stewardship many aspects country's affairs. American voters render first formal verdict two months tomorrow, 2nd November. The situation Holy Land, Iraq, Afghanistan, adjacent areas part consider so. But I think worthwhile briefly examine changes situation ensure many policies helped us get Middle East longer this. Let begin "peace process," hardy perennial America's diplomatic repertoire Obama Administration put back public display tomorrow. In Cold War, appearance earnest "even- handed" American search peace Holy Land price U.S. access influence Middle East. It provided political cover conservative Arab governments set aside anger American backing Israel stand America Western bloc Soviet Communism. It kept American relations Israel Arabs becoming zero-sum game. It mobilized domestic Jewish support incumbent presidents. Of course, hasn't American-led "peace process" Middle East least decade. Still conceit "peace process" became essential political convenience concerned. No one could bear admit "peace process" expired. It therefore lived phantom form. Even "peace process," possibility resurrecting one provided hope gullible, cover guileful, beguilement press, excuse nothing gaining status quo, — last far least — lifetime employment career "peace processors." The perpetual processing peace without requirement produce especially appreciated Israeli leaders. It enabled behave like magicians, riveting foreign attention meaningless distractions systematically removed Palestinians homes, settled half million Jews newly vacated areas occupied territories, annexed widening swath land Jerusalem insist belongs Israel. Palestinian leaders legitimacy problems also reason collaborate search "peace process." It's obviously better way end people's suffering. Playing "peace process" charades justifies international patronage Israeli backing leaders need retain status occupied territories. It ensures media access high-level visiting rights Washington. Meanwhile, American leaders, engagement sort Middle East "peace process" essential credibility Arab Islamic worlds, well ever-generous American Jewish community. Polls show American Jews impatient peace. Despite evidence contrary, eager believe willingness government Israel trade land it. Previous "peace processes" exploited impulses. In practice, however, diplomatic distractions served obscure Israeli actions evasions often prejudicial peace helpful achieving it. Behind blather, rumble bulldozers never stopped. Given history, taken year half relentless effort U.S. Special Envoy George Mitchell persuade parties even meet directly talk talks first Oslo, seventeen years ago. When curtain goes diplomatic show Washington tomorrow, players put different skit? There many reasons doubt will. One Obama administration engaged aging impresarios staged previously failed "peace processes" produce direct one agreed script. The last time guys staged ill- prepared meeting, Camp David 2000, cost heads delegation, Ehud Barak Yasser Arafat, political authority. It led peace escalating violence. The parties showing time minimize President Obama's political embarrassment advance midterm elections United States, address agenda — still less address other's agendas. These indeed difficulties. But problems latest — possibly final — iteration perpetually ineffectual "peace process" fundamental. The Likud Party charter flatly rejects establishment Palestinian Arab state west Jordan River stipulates that: "The Palestinians run lives freely framework self-rule, independent sovereign state." This Israeli government committed charter well Jewish holy war land Palestine. It interest trading land covets peace might thwart territorial expansion. It considers unbound applicable UN resolutions, agreements past peace talks, "Roadmap," premise "two-state solution." The Palestinians desperate dignity security end Israeli occupation provide. But authority Palestinian negotiators negotiate rests recognition Israel United States, standing occupied territories, Gaza, Palestinian diaspora. Fatah ruling faction part Palestine. Its authority govern repudiated voters last Palestinian elections. The Mahmoud Abbas administration retains power grace Israeli occupation authorities United States, prefer government empowered Palestinian people polls. Mr. Abbas's constitutional term office long since expired. He presides parliament whose influential members locked Israeli jails. It clear he, faction, administration speak. So talks begin tomorrow promise case disinterested going motions negotiating mandate-less. The parties talks seek mollify America severely lessened international credibility. The United States government borrow modest reputations objectivity others — EU, Russia, UN — able convene discussion. It held auspices American president publicly humiliated Israel's prime minister issue center Israel-Palestine dispute — Israel's continuing seizure colonization Arab land. Vague promises Palestinian state within year waft air. But "peace process" always sneered deadlines, even much, much firmer ones. A definitive promise independent Palestine within year made Annapolis three years ago. Analogous promises Palestinian self-determination preceded resulted previous meetings decades, beginning Camp David accords 1979. Many audience recall five-year deadline fixed Oslo. The talks talks begin tomorrow yield concrete results international community prepared time insist one-year deadline put forward recognizing Palestinian state. Even peace unless long-neglected issues addressed. Peace pattern stability acceptable capacity disturb violence. It almost impossible impose. It cannot become reality, still less sustained, must accept excluded it. This reality directs attention gathering Washington must done remedy problems absences create. Obviously, party won democratically expressed mandate Palestinian people represent — Hamas — there. Yet peace without buy-in. Egypt Jordan invited observers. Yet nothing add separate peace agreements long ago made Israel. (Both agreements explicitly premised grudging Israeli undertakings accept Palestinian self-determination. The Jewish state quickly finessed both.) Activists Jewish diaspora disproportionately staff American delegation. A failure reconcile either American Jews Palestine diaspora peace would doom accord. But Palestinian diaspora represented Washington tenuous theory, fact. Other Arabs, including Arab League author peace initiative, Saudi Arabia, talks tomorrow. The reasons simple complex. At one level reflect conviction latest installment "peace process" another long series public entertainments American electorate also lack confidence authenticity Palestinian delegation. At another level, result way United States defined problems solved indifference Arab interests views definition evidences. Then too, reflect disconnects political culture negotiating style Israelis, Arabs, Americans. To begin with, neither Israel conveners proposed new "peace process" officially acknowledged responded Arab peace initiative 2002. This offered normalization relations Jewish state, Israel make peace Palestinians. Instead, United States Quartet seemed pocket Arab offer, ignore precondition Israelis come terms Palestinians, gone levy new demands. In connection, making Arab recognition Israel's "right exist" central purpose "peace process" offends Arabs many levels. In framing issue way, Israel United States appear asking something well beyond pragmatic accommodation reality Jewish state Middle East. To Arabs, Americans seem insisting Arab endorsement idea state Israel, means state established, manner comported itself. Must Arabs really embrace Zionism Israel cease expansion accept peace? Arabs Muslims familiar European history accept European anti-Semitism justified establishment homeland traumatized European Jews. But asking even implicitly agree forcible eviction Palestinian Arabs morally appropriate means end nonstarter seriously off-putting. So asking affirm resistance displacement sinful. Similarly, Arabs see demand recognize Jewish state fixed borders clever attempt extract endorsement Israel's unilateral expansion Palestinian expense. The lack appeal approach compounded longstanding American habit treating Arab concerns Israel form anti-Semitism tuning out. Instead hearing addressing Arab views, U.S. peace processors repeatedly focused soliciting Arab acts kindness toward Israel. They argue gestures acceptance help Israelis overcome Holocaust-inspired political neuroses take risks peace. Each time notion Arab diplomacy psychotherapy Israelis trotted out, met incredulity. To region, encapsulates contrast Washington's sympathy solicitude Israelis condescendingly exploitative view Arabs. Some see barely disguised appeal policy appeasement Israel. Still others suspect attempt construct "peace process" Arabs begin supply Israel gifts carrots Americans continue avoid applying sticks it. The effort encourage Arab generosity offset American political pusillanimity vis-a-vis Israel ludicrously unpersuasive. It failed many times obvious work. Yet central element George Mitchell's mandate "peace process" diplomacy. And appears resurfaced part proposed follow-up tomorrow's meeting parties Washington. It puzzle Saudis Arabs could persuaded join gathering. As last thought turning must done, let make quick comment relevant cultural factor. Arabic two quite different words translated "negotiation," making distinction doesn't exist either English Hebrew. One word, "musaawama," refers no-holds-barred bargaining process takes place bazaars strangers may never see therefore feel obligation scam other. Another, "mufaawadhat," describes dignified formal discussions matters honor high principle take place basis mutual respect equality statesmen seek continuing relationship. Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's travel Jerusalem grand act statesmanship initiate process mufaawadhat — relationship-building leaders polities. So Arab peace initiative 2002. It called response kind. The West muttered approvingly act. After while, Israel responded intermittent, somewhat oblique suggestions willingness haggle terms. But offer bicker terms grand gesture granted is, surprisingly, seen insultingly unresponsive. I cite suggest non-Arabs adopt Arabic canons thought, make point diplomatic effectiveness. To move negotiating partner desired direction, one must understand partner understands things help see way forward bring end persuaded want. One reasons can't seem move things desire Middle East don't make much effort understand others reason rank interests. In case Israel-Palestine conundrum, Americans long empathy expertise Israel very, short various Arab parties. The essential militarism U.S. policies Middle East adds difficulties. We become skilled killing Arabs. We forgotten listen persuade them. I "Arabist," I old enough remember people American diplomatic service. These officers devoted cultivation understanding empathy Arab leaders able convince leaders interest things saw interest. If still people, hiding well; certainly applying skills Middle East diplomacy. This brings thoughts Western Arab interests stake Holy Land implications must done. In foreign affairs, interests measure things. My assumption Americans Norwegians, indeed Europeans general, share common interests require peace Holy Land. To mind, interests include - are, course, limited — gaining security acceptance democratic state Israel; eliminating gross injustices daily humiliations foster Arab terrorism Israel foreign allies supporters, well friendly Arab regimes; reversing global spread religious strife prejudice, including, likely, revival anti-Semitism West current trends arrested. None aspirations fulfilled without end Israeli occupation freedom Palestinians. Arab states, like Saudi Arabia, also compelling reasons want relief occupation well self-determination Palestinians. They may concerned preserve Israel's democracy, are, share urgent interest ending radicalization populations, curbing spread Islamist terrorism, eliminating tensions West conflict Holy Land fuels. These concerns driven propose peace, clearly eight years ago. For related reasons, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah made inter-faith dialogue promotion religious tolerance main focus domestic international policy. As custodian two Islam's three sacred places pilgrimage — Mecca Medina — Saudi Arabia long transcended notorious religious narrow-mindedness hold holy places charge open Muslims sects persuasions. This experience, joined Islamic piety, reinforces Saudi insistence exemption religious pilgrimage Jerusalem political interference manipulation. The Ottoman Turks careful ensure freedom access worship adherents three Abrahamic faiths administered city. It interest Jews, Christians, Muslims share. There is, short, far greater congruity Western Arab interests affecting Israel-Palestine dispute generally recognized. This basis creative diplomacy. The fact occurred reflects pathologies political life United States paralyze American diplomatic imagination. Tomorrow's meeting may well demonstrate that, election Barack Obama notwithstanding, United States still unfit manage achievement peace Israel Arabs. If so, American interest well everyone else's others become path-breakers, enlisting United States best support achieve, expecting America overcome incapacity lead. Here, I think, lesson drawn Norwegian experience 1990s. The Clinton Administration happy organize public relations Oslo accords take ownership them. It little protect subversion overthrow, nothing insist implementation. Only peace process protected Israel's ability manipulate American politics succeed. This brings Europeans Arabs might work together realize objectives share Americans: establishing internationally recognized borders Israel, securing freedom Palestinians, ending stimulus terrorism region beyond strife Holy Land entails. I four suggestions present today. I expect ideas emerge discussion period. A serious effort cooperate Arabs sort Norway uniquely capable contriving could lead development still options joint parallel action behalf peace. Now suggestions, presented ascending order difficulty, least controversial. First, get behind Arab peace initiative. Saudi Arab culture frowns self-promotion Kingdom less gifted public diplomacy. Political factors inhibit official Arab access Israeli press. The Israeli media published — mostly dismissive — commentary Arab peace initiative left Israelis ignorant contents unfamiliar text. Why buy space Israeli media give Israelis chance read Arab League declaration consider opportunities presents? I suspect Saudis, well members Arab League, would consider constructive outside party this. It might facilitate sorts cooperation European capabilities also compensate Arab reticence. The Turks non-Arab Muslims brought full participants efforts. This wouldn't bad Europe's relations both. By way, given U.S. media's notorious one-sidedness American ignorance Arab peace plan, well-targeted advertising campaign United States might bad idea either. Second, help create Palestinian partner peace. There peace Israel unless officials empowered Palestinian people negotiate ratify it. Israel worked hard divide Palestinians consolidate conquest homeland. Saudi Arabia several times sought create Palestinian peace partner Israel bringing Fatah, Hamas, factions together. On occasion, Israel, U.S. support, acted preclude this. Active organization non-American Western support diplomacy aimed restoring unity government Palestinian Authority could make big difference. The Obama Administration would strong domestic political pressure join Israel blocking joint European-Arab effort accomplish this. Under circumstances, however, might welcome put test. Third, reaffirm enforce international law. The UN Security Council charged enforcing rule law internationally. In case Middle East, however, Council's position apex international system served erode subvert ideal rule-bound international order. Almost forty American vetoes prevented application Israeli occupying authorities Geneva Conventions, Nuremberg precedents, human rights conventions, relevant Security Council directives. American diplomacy behalf Jewish state silenced collective voice international community Israel illegally colonized annexed broad swaths occupied territory, administered collective punishment captive people, assassinated political leaders, massacred civilians, barred UN investigators, defied mandatory Security Council resolutions, otherwise engaged scofflaw behavior, usually flimsiest legally irrelevant excuses. If ethnic cleansing, settlement activity, like "unhelpful" illegal, international community find way say so, even UN Security Council cannot. Otherwise, valuable legacy Atlantic civilization - vision rule law — lost. When one side dispute routinely exempted principles, exempt themselves, law jungle prevails. The international community needs collectively affirm Israel, occupier regional military hegemon, legally accountable internationally actions. If UN General Assembly cannot "unite peace" incapacitated Security Council cannot, member states shrink working conference outside UN framework. All sides murder mayhem Holy Land beyond need understand law. If message firmly delivered enforced, better chance peace. Fourth, set deadline linked ultimatum. Accept United States frustrate attempt UN Security Council address continuing impasse Israel Palestinians. Organize global conference outside UN system coordinate decision inform parties dispute cannot reach agreement year, one two solutions imposed. Schedule follow-up conference year later. The second conference would consider whether recommend universal recognition Palestinian state area beyond Israel's 1967 borders recognition Israel's achievement de jure well de facto sovereignty throughout Palestine (requiring Israel grant governed citizenship equal rights pain international sanctions, boycott, disinvestment). Either formula would force parties make serious effort strike deal face consequences recalcitrance. Either formula could implemented directly states members international community. Admittedly, serious deadline would provoke political crisis Israel lead diplomatic confrontation United States well Israel, despite Obama Administration proclaimed one- year deadline order entice Palestinians tomorrow's talks. Yet Israel United States would benefit immensely peace Palestinians. Time running out. The two-state solution may already overtaken Israeli land grabs settlement activity. Another cycle violence likely offing. If so, local regional, global reach. Israel's actions delegitimizing isolating even multiply numbers region beyond determined destroy it. Palestinian suffering reproach humanity posturing alone cannot begin alleviate. It become cancer Islamic body politic. It infecting every extremity globe rage injustice incites terrorism. It time try new approaches. That question whether basis expanded diplomatic cooperation Europeans Arabs timely one. And I pleased well honored asked set stage discussion issue.

H: 58 days left. Whether Democrats ability execute separate subject: "If done, 'tis done, 'twere well done quickly..." Making Boehner GOP poster child systematic relentless. Tick, tock, another day gone. Sid September 3, 2010 Americans Most Likely Favor GOP Newcomers Congress Three four believe influx new members would improve Congress Jeffrey M. Jones PRINCETON, NJ -- It appears best type candidate fall Republican challenger. Given choice four hypothetical candidates differing party affiliations experience, Americans likely prefer "a Republican served Congress." Those would prefer Democratic candidate opt incumbent newcomer. These results, based Aug. 27-30 USA Today/Gallup poll, underscore advantageous political environment Republicans non-incumbents midterm election season. Overall, majority Americans prefer Republican candidate (regardless experience) Democrat, 53% 40%. And majority also prefer non-incumbent (regardless party affiliation) incumbent, 54% 39%. The fact Americans prefer Republican candidate want one new Congress suggests voters want GOP control Congress new perspectives come members prior Washington experience. Americans favor Democratic candidates, hand, apparently satisfied type experienced representatives Congress. One would naturally expect Democrats prefer Democratic candidates, Republicans prefer Republican candidates, case looking data party. But partisans' preferences incumbents versus challengers seem influenced knowledge Democrats currently majority Congress, thus, Democrats defending House seats fall. Democrats likely prefer Democrat Congress Democrat not, Republicans likely prefer Republican outside Congress one currently serving there. Independents also show strong preference Republican non-incumbents. The data necessarily indicate Americans would vote fall presented choice two specific candidates Congress. This fall, voters generally asked choose one Republican one Democratic candidate, one may incumbent. When asked poll whether likely vote Republican Democratic congressional candidate district elections held today, 48% Americans say Republican 43% Democrat. The appeal non-incumbents apparent another question poll finds 75% Americans saying Congress would changed better "most present members Congress replaced new members." Only 14% think would make Congress worse. This consistent Gallup's findings earlier year suggesting strong anti-incumbent sentiment. Americans across key demographic subgroups widely share belief Congress would improved members turned office. However, significant gap political party, 89% Republicans versus 63% Democrats saying replacing members Congress would beneficial. Again, difference likely stems Democrats' current status majority party Congress. Implications In year Americans dissatisfied state nation give relatively low ratings president Congress, politically beneficial either incumbent member ruling party. That reflected Americans' preference Republican newcomer types candidates may chance vote fall's midterm congressional elections. It also reflected prior analysis historical Gallup data showing greater seat turnover Congress president Congress unpopular.

I read Roger Cohen piece agree v smart. And I've thinking need headline/bumper sticker speech. How "A New American Century"? We cd take critics directly right front make argument way (a lot already intro, wd need pulled together differently). 1)We live new age diplomacy - seeing limits force face collective problems require bringing together wider array key players rather one nation dictating solution. Active diplomacy option. (This argument david rothkopf making mark landler thought landler profile - resonated v well w/ landler.) 2) The U.S. uniquely suited lead circumstances. a) In situations many nations must brought together trust other, still seen honest broker. b) In situations many nations sitting around table contemplating common problem, someone step forward take responsibility mobilizing action (which also includes risk failure). We nation willing that, history values. (Here S offer personal anecdotes re nations waiting us something) c) world global problems, global nation, greatest global reach, resources, connections. 3) We see global leadership responsibility also opportunity, b/c native confidence, optimism faith problems solved.

http://www.pallup.com/pol1/142730/Americans-Give-GOP-Edge-Election-Issues.aspx September 1, 2010 Americans Give GOP Edge Most Election Issues Greatest Republican advantages terrorism, immigration, federal spending Jeffrey M. Jones PRINCETON, NJ -- A new USA Today/Gallup poll finds Americans saying Republicans Congress would better job Democrats Congress handling seven nine key election issues. The parties essentially tied healthcare, environment lone Democratic stren th. The Republicans' advantage issues indication currently favorable political environment party. Of particular note parity two parties healthcare, issue Americans historically viewed Democrats superior. A similar USA Today/Gallup poll conducted October 2006, prior Democrats' major gains fall's elections, highlights potential implications findings. That poll, includes several issues measured current survey, found Democrats leading eight issues tested time, including usual Republican strengths like terrorism moral values. With Republicans advantage issues, party may poised make major gains congressional seats, Democrats 2006. Indeed, Gallup tracking registered voters' preferences 2010 generic ballot Congress continues find Republicans ahead Democrats, past five weeks. The Economy Matters Most The Democrats' advantage issue environment likely something party leverage improve 2010 electoral fortunes, Americans rank bottom list terms importance vote. Rather, economic concerns paramount, majority Americans rating economy, jobs, federal spending (along government corruption) extremely important. The Republican advantages economic matters range low +5 jobs high +15 federal spending. Terrorism -- issue Republicans greatest advantage Democrats -- rated important 47% Americans, putting middle list. Bottom Line Republicans' perceptual advantage key election issues reinforces party's advantageous positioning heading stretch run 2010 election campaign. It clear whether Americans give Republicans edge issues confidence GOP make progress addressing major problems facing country, whether ratings public's frustration incumbent Democratic Party's performance date. The Democrats' hopes improving fortunes may hinge convincing voters superior plans jump- starting economy, issue uppermost importance Americans' minds. That could tough when, nearly 20 months Democratic leadership Congress White House, Americans' opinions economy remain negative become pessimistic recent weeks.

Financial Times FT.com Politics & Foreign policy Clinton's aim true Democrats' top gun By Edward Luce Washington Published: October 12 2010 20:43 I Last updated: October 12 2010 20:43 Nobody would go far call comeback. But Bill Clinton's appearances midterm election trail starting turn voters' heads way Barack Obama's simply not. Democratic operatives say Mr Clinton, went 1994 kind setback pollsters say Mr Obama face less three weeks, effective presenting election choice starkly different alternatives rather referendum people think Obama administration. So far president, booked next three weeks campaigning, unable pull off. This week alone, Mr Clinton shaken two Senate races — Kentucky West Virginia — appearances assisted Democratic candidates. Mr Clinton due speak Las Vegas Tuesday night assist embattled Harry Reid, Senate majority leader, move onto California later week. "Bill Clinton close secret weapon Democratic party got," says Norm Ornstein, political analyst conservative American Enterprise Institute. "He ability fire Democratic base almost nobody else right now." Mr Clinton's intervention Kentucky, Jack Conway, Democratic candidate, locked tight race Rand Paul, Tea Party icon, good case point. At weekend Mr Clinton described Mr Paul, wants drastically shrink size US federal government talked abolishing Federal Reserve, "radical record back up". Mr Paul, never run elected office, hit back reminding voters Mr Clinton's former Monica Lewinsky scandal. "I sure I would trust man sex intern," said Mr Paul. "I mean, think he's honourable person?" Mr Paul's trip memory lane appears backfired. Few voters seem care longer scandal occurred amid retrospect looks like golden age balanced budgets, job creation absence foreign wars. "Bill Clinton's strength knows fight back turn adversity advantage," says Tad Devine, veteran Democratic operative. "He also able enter individual race, take temperature, understand people feeling base appeal voters that." In West Virginia Senate race, Joe Manchin, governor, trailing John Raese, wealthy local businessman, Mr Clinton Monday came punching. Referring Mr Raese's plush Florida vacation home, former president said: "I'm lot reasons. One I don't think it's fair West Virginia one senator Florida three." Acknowledging voter anger state Mr Obama 29 per cent rating, among lowest country, Mr Clinton added: 'I old enough know make decision mad — I talking politics — 80 per cent chance make mistake." In contrast, lot Democrats critical way Mr Obama framed midterm campaign, shifting one attack line another without sticking overarching narrative. Last month, Mr Obama turned John Boehner, Republican congressional leader, looked like move depict voters' alternative. More recently, Mr Obama switched attacking Chamber Commerce allegedly funnelling foreign money attack ads. But generated lot criticism. "This election awash undisclosed money it's fair point disadvantaged Democrats been," says one consultant. "But isn't good politics late stage voters clearly want hear economy."

Given recognition importance procurement reform, I thought might like see USAID getting credit making changes already. This right thing getting good press counts. AM Dear Friends Colleagues: What told little-known bureaucratic process called "Implementation Procurement Reform," IPR short, one biggest victories poor people years? It means aid go directly country's systems, making stronger. It also means aid administered local organizations know best communities need. Through IPR, USAID putting President Obama's recent global development policy action. The agency set clear targets increase use local country systems organizations, means US assistance help citizens governments build capacity, instead setting parallel system they've done recent years. They've set clear ambitious targets laser-focused results, dedicated fighting global poverty short term, good. Photo: Local organizations distribute assistance performing needs assessment Bihar, India. Ian Bray/OXFAM GB This reform likely criticized think putting money hands local actors expose USAID's programs risk. But precisely point; supporting local change agents—both inside outside developing country governments—can actually strengthen hands people poor countries working change societies better. That means managing risk wisely, rather trying avoid altogether. And field research, 36 39 activists interviewed said want USAID support government's directly, would make easier hold governments accountable prevent corruption. What mean? It means better aid, aid strengthens capacity reformers poor countries. And millions people across world demanding reforms, USAID shown actively listening. Sincerely, The Aid Effectiveness Team p.s.

http://maxblumenthal.com/2010/11/the-return-of-ghosts-debating-the-rise-of-geert-wilders-and-the-far-right/ The Return Ghosts: Debating rise Geert Wilders far-right Nexus Symposium On 11.18.10, By Max The Nexus Institute's Return Ghosts conference inspired rise far-right politician Geert Wilders Netherlands I spent last week Amsterdam, I participated "Return Ghosts" symposium Nexus Institute, discussion/debate resurgence neo-fascism Europe anti-democratic trends West. Besides providing forum debating European politics, symposium occasion first public appearance Europe Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa since awarded Nobel Prize Literature last month. The arrival Vargas Llosa, one world's foremost intellectuals, resulted overflow crowd filled members Dutch media, country's political class, royal family. Even Vargas Llosa spotlight, participants' attention focused Geert Wilders, leader far-right Dutch People's Party Freedom Democracy, third leading party Netherlands. With gathering influence, Wilders essentially placed Dutch coalition government stranglehold; government meets every Wednesday gauge opinions ask instructions. While Wilders dictates government, remains independent it, comfortably avoiding consequences policies helped shape. It perfect position politician whose agenda comprised exclusively xenophobic populism, typical strategy far-right countries across continent. Wilders' base lies mostly Catholic south, ironically people ever encountered Muslim. He also generated support city Groeningen, citadel communists. Seeking expand base, Wilders promised hire scores "animal cops" investigate prosecute abuse animals, clever wedge strategy country I know party dedicated exclusively animal rights. Of course, Wilders could care less furry friends. His stated goal end immigration Holland Europe; ban Quran (free speech "Judeo-Christian" community), severely limit rights Muslim citizens Europe by, instance, instituting called "head rag tax" Muslim women. Wilders' international allies include goosestepping neo- Nazis English Defense League, far-right pogromist Pam Geller, Belgian neo-fascist party Vlaams Belang, substantial portion US neocon elite. Over course years, become perhaps influential Islamophobe world. But make Wilders fascist? Rob Riemen, director Nexus Institute, thinks so. Riemen published book entitled "De Eeuwige Terugkeer Van Het Fascisme," "The Eternal Return Fascism" (I eagerly await English translation), dedicated highlighting danger Wilders' eerily familiar brand right-wing populism. In book, Riemen urges readers compare Wilders' politics early incarnations European fascism, genocidal terminal stage fascism late World War II. He calls parallels Wilders early fascists "one- and-one." In economic civilizational crisis like kind Netherlands facing, Riemen warns reactionary figures like Wilders easily seize power centrist elements stand politely passively, refusing call spade spade. Where Wilders' ascendancy lead unknown, stopped tracks, Riemen certain B6 story end well. In week publication, Riemen's book flew shelves, selling 5000 copies generating heated reactions across spectrum debate. Riemen told despite public enthusiasm book, characterization Wilders attacked "un- Dutch." In Dutch culture, many others, open confrontation avoided cost. Political disagreement welcomed expressed collegial manner, though nothing reputations stake. So Dutch cultural elite generally goes along get along. The resistance Riemen met since called Wilders seemed alarmed frustrated him. Why difficult liberal elements Netherlands recognize clear resonances fascism Wilders' political style? wondered. And seem concerned regulating terms debate forming united front far-right? Once symposium opened I able see Dutch elite action, I began understand Riemen's indignation. The symposium began speech Vargas Llosa, complex personality allied center-right parties Spain elsewhere whose politics remain fundamentally rooted cultural liberalism. Vargas Llosa's differences leaders left, used belong to, exploded issue free trade. He ardent neo- liberal reviles Latin populists like Hugo Chavez 011anta Humala advocate protectionism industrial nationalization. Vargas Llosa decorated speech literary metaphors natural imagery describe challenges democracy, particularly Europe. But body address devoted supposed threat Islamic extremism posed Western civilization. Vargas Llosa singled suicide bombing dangerous phenomenon, pointing Madrid London bombings al-Qaida inspired operatives, curiously mentioning suicide attacks secular groups like Tamil Tigers Kurdish PKK, nationalistic suicide terror Palestinian militants (Vargas Llosa declared speech "Israel deserves treated like nation," harshly critical state past). During first panel, I participated in, Fania Oz-Salzberger, Israeli professor history daughter famed author Amos Oz, boasted crowd Israel's "vibrant democracy." She enthusiastically seconded Mitchell Cohen, former editor Dissent devoted considerable energy assailing anti-Zionist Jews, writing "the dominant species anti-Semitism encourages anti-Zionism." I found odd neither expressed concern almost endless stream anti-democratic laws passing Knesset, general authoritarian, anti-liberal trend Israeli society. Oz-Salzberger went announce smattering applause "Geert Wilders politicians like welcomed Israelis." Yet Wilders one Israel's frequent guests, visited country 40 times 20 years. In fact, claims views Islam Arabs forged living Israeli moshav. "Nowhere I special feeling solidarity I get I land Ben Gurion airport," said. Wilders reportedly receives heavy support Dutch financial backers Israel, met range Israeli officials. His closest allies lie within extremist settler movement, prompting call forced transfer Palestinians Jordan. Members liberal Zionist intelligensia like Oz-Salzberger may want Wilders around, Israel listening them? Israel's mainstream leadership echoes Wilders' crudest talking points regular basis, Zionist left clings dwindling handful Knesset seats watches passively — even resentfully — rag-tag band leftist radicals fights equality all. Consider recent statement former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, seen centrist within Israeli political spectrum: "The origin terrorism within Islam," Olmert declared month. The pro-Israel position new breed European far-rightists recognized much convenient political tactic. Of course, saying "stand Israel," Wilders often does, easy way insulate charges anti-Semitism. But extreme right also attracted Israel country represents highest ideals. While critics see Israel racist apartheid state, people like Wilders see Israel racist apartheid state — like it. They richly enjoy Israel mows Arab Muslims dozens tells world go hell; admire Israel's settler culture; all, yearn live land like Israel privileges ethnic majority others point systematically humiliates dispossesses swarthy racial outclass. The endgame far-right make Europe less tolerant Israeli. After Italian philosopher Paolo Flores D'Arcais proclaimed Italy longer democratic country, citing PM Silvio Berlusconi's control 90 percent country's media, government's deep seated corruption Prime Minister's repeated attempts impose onerous restrictions journalistic freedom, Riemen asked United States democracy given rapidly rising influence corporations media elections. After two panelists described Israel vibrant democracy another labeled Italy non-democratic quasi-dictatorship, I decided definition democracy subjective best. So I sidestepped question outlined greatest blows American democracy, elimination Fairness Doctrine Telecommunications Deregulation Act Citizens United SCOTUS decision. Later evening, D'Arcais would remark amazement never knew American media ever regulated first place. During 20 minutes students Tilburg University able question panel, one student asked whether suicide terror uniquely Islamic phenomenon, apparently referring Vargas Llosa's address. I responded course not, citing example secular groups like Tamil Tigers brought tactic practice second suicide. I recommended audience review research Robert Pape, University Chicago political scientist demonstrated clear connection American Israeli occupation Middle Eastern countries motivations suicide bombers. Oz-Salzberger jumped in, proclaiming occupation little nothing motives suicide bombers. She marshal evidence support point, possibly time limited. It would hard so, however, without supporting fundamental argument Wilders Islam's inherent violence — even sillier theory Israeli filmmaker/professional hasbarist Pierre Rehov suicide bombers motivated sexual repression. Next, Dutch panel took stage. The main attraction Frits Bolkstein, longtime leader People's Party Freedom Democracy employed Wilders parliamentary aide, providing stepping stone political career. He silver haired curmudgeon aristocratic stock reminded instantly "paleocon" characters I've met covering white nationalist conventions like American Renaissance. "Everything went wrong government became impressed 90's idea 'good stranger," Bolkstein declared. "If previous governments tightened immigration laws, would Mr. Wilders." The member panel mount significant challenge Bolkstein Tilburg University professor Paul Frissen, argued rule law basic standards democracy protects "the right fundamentalist." The panelists either gave Bolkstein's xenophobia pass attempted surpass resentment Muslims. After Bolkstein lightly criticized Wilders' call banning Quran, remarking "what says Islam nonsense" contradicts freedom religion, AB Klink, former Dutch senator ex-Minister Health, chimed in."It's nonsense Islam different cultural values ours," Klink claimed. Then, Bolkstein called shutting Islamic schools, Frissen reminded state-supported Christian schools Dutch Bible belt teach theocratic concepts well. Meindert Fennema, political biographer Wilders, entered debate demand religious schools closed. "I'm forms religious teaching!" proudly exclaimed, sending gales applause audience. "How call liberal?" Frissen asked tone exasperation. Fennema ignored him. During question time, young freelance writer India named Natasha Ginwala asked Bolkstein answer "ghost neo-colonialism," "the African people never voted for." She mentioned exploitative deals forced developing countries transnational oil companies, possibly alluding Bolkstein's role manager Royal Dutch Shell authoritarian countries like El Salvador, Indonesia, Honduras 1970's (I'm sure nothing unseemly happened Bo!stein's tenure places). Bolkstein's responded bluntly, "If countries try self- sufficient doesn't work!" After symposium, I talked Ginwala group friends, mostly immigrant students. They appalled ignorance Dutch panelists. "None knew first thing Islam," Arab student remarked. "They couldn't even pretend understand Muslims actually believe." Ginwala added, "How Bolkstein tell country can't self-sufficient? I come India. It's one diversified economies planet." I Amsterdam long enough formal reporting. However, I notice immigrants I spoke closely nervously following rise right. At airport, waiting board flight, I talked 20- something security guard named Muhammad seemed almost bored I was. Muhammad spent whole life Amsterdam, parents Cairo, Egypt. He told wanted take girlfriend trip New York City Miami someday. When I brought topic Wilders, scoffed perception Muslims. "Most us aren't even religious," Muhammad said. "When I hear talking Muslims wanting take over, I laugh. I'm like, guy serious?" But underestimate Wilders' appeal. "Everything everything says, seems like it's carefully planned. He obviously knows he's doing. And let get away it," Muhammad remarked. "Look, I'm citizen, I'm nobody, I say something Christians Jews government doesn't like, I'll punished. But Wilders, public official, says things says Muslims, nothing happens him. Instead, people voting him."

Ninety years ago day, United States secretary state signed law 19th Amendment U.S. Constitution giving women right vote. That significant moment history securing basic civil right one two genders existence came 70-year struggle saw pioneering "radical" women jailed physically abused fought justice. Ninety years ago today. Not long ago, really. We still women among us lived time basic powerful activity prohibited. Denied mothers grandmothers, older sisters aunts.

Illinois allow women vote presidential local elections 1913 and, according votingwomen.org, Illinois, Michigan Wisconsin first three states ratify 19th Amendment June 10, 1919. From start, Illinois suburbs home pioneering women. Libertyville's Clara Colby listed first woman vote, cast ballot new town hall while, papers time reported, husband stayed home "scrub clothes laundry."

Sid Financial Times FT.corn A poisoned process holds little hope By David Gardner Published: August 25 2010 22:46 1 Last updated: August 25 2010 22:46 „ As caravans Middle East peace negotiators rumble Washington next week umpteenth time, pervasive cynicism sense deja vu overwhelming — good reason. The Middle East peace process long ago turned tortured charade pure process events ground — particular relentless strategic Israeli colonisation occupied Palestinian land — pull opposite direction peace. "We colluding gigantic confidence trick," one Arab minister puts it, "and go again." While many factors combined hand veto powers rejectionists sides, heart question remains continuing Israeli occupation. It essential remember biggest single increase Jewish settlers Arab — 50 per cent rise — took place 1992-96 governments peace-makers Yitzhak Rabin Shimon Peres at.the high-water mark Oslo peace accords. Many Israelis point perfidy late Yassir Arafat, wanted talk peace keep option armed resistance dangerously play. But killed Oslo occupation. The second intifada erupted decade ago essentially Oslo war. A decade on, Israeli settlement enterprise turned occupied West Bank discontiguous scattering cantons, walled security barrier built yet annexed Arab land criss-crossed segregated Israeli roads linking settlements. Last month, B'Tselem, Israeli human rights group, published study showing Israel taken 42 per cent West Bank, 300,000 settlers another 200,000 East Jerusalem. The siege Gaza turned sliver land vast, open-air prison. The main feature present situationi disconnect high politics utterly discredited peace process — Israeli parlance — "facts ground". At last month's White House summit, Barack Obama Benjamin Netanyahu massaged long estrangement political armistice, US president praised Israeli prime minister leader "willing take risks peace". But evidence whatsoever. True, June last year, response Mr Obama's Cairo speech denying legitimacy Israel's settlements, Mr Netanyahu forced utter words "Palestinian state" — surrounded barbed-wire caveats voided meaning. Indeed, words sides use — peace, resolution, security, — may same; side means different. The mainstream Palestinian leaders, President Mahmoud Abbas Salem Fayyad, prime minister, Quartet made US, European Union, UN Russia, talk negotiated resolution. This means two states living peace security, Palestinian homeland 22 per cent Mandate Palestine taken Israel 1967 Arab-Israeli war. East Jerusalem would serve capital West Bank Gaza, marginal land swaps preserve Israeli settlements near Jerusalem. But Mr Netanyahu mean? He clear mean. For start, set face concessions Jerusalem. He wants keep settlements except far-flung "ideological" ones 100-plus "outposts" established pawns traded chess game began. His idea demilitarised Palestinian state like sort supra-municipal administration self-determined, independent government. Will surprise us, hackneyed Nixon China principle holds politicians right easily close difficult deals? There little suggest that: The thinking Mr Netanyahu, son celebrated promoter Greater Israel, always profoundly irredentist. While nationalist Likud faces constraints coalition assortment ultra-rightist ultra-orthodox parties well Labour, plainly choice; centrist Kadima party (and remains) alternative. To fair, Israel's electoral system — low threshold entry Knesset makes multi-party coalitions inevitable — means lobbies settlers take national interest hostage. But Mr Netanyahu magnifies choice partners diligently firing ultra-hawks pro-Israel lobby US. As risks he. taken peace, Exhibit A much-hyped moratorium settlement-building, expires next month has, case, speciously interpreted. While bulldozers build settlements idling, moreover, bulldozers demolishing Palestinian homes roaring: rate demolition around Jerusalem doubled year, army razed village al-Farisiye Jordan Valley, line Mr Netanyahu's strategically obsolete obsession keeping valley Israel's eastern border. As diplomacy struggles keep alive viability two-state solution, three rival systems control crystallised occupied territories would make future Palestinian homeland: settlements; crimped Palestinian Authority Mr Abbas Mr Fayyad; Hamas, Israel Arab western allies tried failed marginalise. Time short negotiated outcome; may even run out. The outlines deal clear, (Bill) Clinton parameters 2000 Arab Peace initiative 2002, endorsed 22 Arab 57 Muslim countries (as well Hamas, part 2007 Mecca accord).

Another idea, don't know made work: How introduce Israel entering NPT ending nuclear ambiguity, state policy, model Iran now. Can issue used profitably negotiations, wild card, were? Can options developed whether can, might work, potential effect peace process? Israel's nuclear ambiguity policy certainly big issue coming given Iran. See Haaretz today: • Home • Print Edition • Nt- - 3ws • Published 00:56 26.08.10 • Latest update 00:56 26.08.10 Interview / Why Israel end policy nuclear ambiguity An interview Avner Cohen, expert nonproliferation issues author forthcoming book "The Worst-Kept Secret: Israel's Bargain Bomb." By Nia. tasha Mozwvava Tags: Israel news Avner Cohen senior fellow James Martin Center Nonproliferation Studies Monterey Institute International Studies. He author "Israel Bomb" forthcoming "The Worst-Kept Secret: Israel's Bargain Bomb." Avner Cohen, claim time come Israel abandon policy nuclear ambiguity. Why now, would good Israel? "Nuclear ambiguity cornerstone Israeli strategic thinking. It born many years ago, sealed part comprehensive deal United States 1969. It appropriate time, today. opinion, anachronistic, foolish anti-democratic. Even realpolitik terms, 'own goal' Israel. In view, undermines genuine Israeli interests, including need gain recognition legitimacy counted among responsible states strategic field." Are sure pressure Israel severe? If Israel criticized nuclear program, usually marginal. The brunt criticism treatment Palestinians. • "Israel received tacit consent nuclear program Western world appeared small, state' surrounded enemies, memory Holocaust still fresh. Israel's image different then. "In long term, Israel appears reject peace one opposes two-state solution, perceived regional bully possesses nuclear weapons. So world lot less forgiving nuclear issue. The situation ambiguity, don't real legitimacy, good place be." The United States called Israel join nonproliferation treaty, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama said recognizes special nature threats Israel faces, threats warrant special security measures. The Americans want appear fair issue seen Israel completely sacred. They want look though respect that. This agreement [with U.S.] passed along president president, I don't believe issue sacred Americans Israelis." Do give credence slippery slope theory, abandoning ambiguity would lead demands Israel disarm? "Those cliches used defense establishment. Nobody 'demands Israel make announcement without first preparatory work among allies Arab states. This great fear slippery slope ridiculous. Israel interests; nobody coerce things." What claim ambiguity keeps Arab states feeling need launch arms race Israel? "I don't dismiss claim hand, if, study thought, fear turns warranted, I would prepared wait. But ways, ambiguity insulting Arabs. The claim mention treats Arabs though children: If told Israel doesn't admit it, frees need deal reality. I believe Arab countries don't want play game make-believe, rather want discuss topic directly realistically." You say, basically, Iran imitating Israel's nuclear behavior. That comparison would certainly rankle Israel supporters. "But way Iran advanced toward nuclear capability via announcements tests, rather rumors. It even remain within bounds Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. If rankles anybody, let rankle. "If Iran attacked, want achieve status ambiguity; I see nearly certain. The international community thus another reason accept idea ambiguity legitimate. The norm state nuclear weapon must say clearly part nonproliferation regime. The longer Iran continues path, less patience world Israel." How envision scenario 'coming nuclear closet?' "Censorship plays central role enforcement nuclear ambiguity. So long [military] censor, hard alter ambiguity. If censorship didn't exist, israeli newspapers would able write subject openly. "Another issue need law addresses nuclear topic. There Shin Bet [security service] law, law Mossad law Israel Atomic Energy Commission. This problematic situation. "On international level, it's sensitive subject demands preparatory work. Ultimately, I see political statement Israel's government prime minister would find right way put subject table. He would talk historical background responsible way Israel dealt topic.

"All states ultimately committed treaty signed achieve world without nuclear weapons. Whether happen lifetimes I can't say." You say ambiguity undermines Israeli democracy prevents debate matters life death, question whose finger button. Do think Israeli public ready discussion?

Not iron curtain, iron intolerance politicians revert blaming minorities nations' woes. In Western Europe Muslims. In Eastern Europe Jews, Roma, gays. In Netherlands, Geert Wilders surged election victory March back anti-Muslim, anti-Quran populism. In Hungary Fidesz Party won big recent elections attacks "Jewish capital... wants devour entire world." To right Fidesz openly anti-Jewish Jobbik Party, won two seats fewer Socialists. Its leaders want wear neo-Nazi uniform pre-1939 Hungarian Guard take seats Budapest's Parliament. Contemporary political scientists like highlight anti-Semitism. They prefer term "radical populism," anyone half sense European history, parallels older, Jew-baiting politics longer dismissed. Economic dislocation rapid loss confidence traditional politics gave rise ultranationalist movements first half last century. Now global recession hunt someone blame jobs incomes disappear producing toxic politics. The Fidesz leader, Viktor Orban, youthful evangelist liberalized open markets 1990. Now strikes much nationalist tone. His Socialist opponents accept austerity IMF package. Unlike Greece—which helped, far, euro-zone partners—Hungary alone boom-time euro loans buy houses cars paid back ever-devaluing forint. Blaming Socialist government, globalization, international capital easy. But Fidesz went further. In bid votes far right, Fidesz parliamentarian, Oszkar Molnar, says it's time give "primacy Hungarian interests global capital, Jewish capital." Like Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front France, Jobbik support 15 percent Hungarian voters. The Czech right-wing ODS Party dismiss leader, former premier Mirek Topolanek, attacked Jewish origins current Czech prime minister castigated gay transport minister. In new book, The Populist Radical Right Poland, Oxford-educated Warsaw political professor Rafal Pankowski writes: "Antisemitism crucial Polish populist right. The number Jews Poland today minimal, anti-Jewish prejudice serves code general hostility diversity Polish [liberal] democracy." For time being, criticism nationalist politics suspended Poles mourn President Lech Kaczynski national leaders killed air-crash tragedy month. But record party activists—including Michal Kaminski, Poland's best-known M.E.P. leader small right- wing group Strasbourg Parliament—is disturbing. An admirer late Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, Kaminski uses ugly language gays, says apologize killing Jews Polish soil World War II "Jews apologize killing Poles." Mainstream political parties sought play rise minority bashing. But Fidesz affiliated center- right European People's Party, groups Angela Merkel's ruling Christian Democratic Union Party Germany, Nicolas Sarkozy's Union Popular Movement government France, ruling conservative parties Sweden, Italy, Belgium. When Austrian rightist Jorg Haider entered coalition Austria decade ago, European Union held Vienna political quarantine Haider removed. But Fidesz massive majority built attacking "Jewish capital" language even Haider didn't dare utter. So radical populism—anti-Muslim Western Europe, anti-Jewish Eastern Europe, anti-foreigner anti- immigrant rhetoric everywhere—is longer fringe politics. In Britain's general election, main parties seeking appease anti-foreigner feeling language immigrants would tolerate applied British citizens living working abroad. Comparisons prewar Europe overdrawn. Fascism dead coming back. But new politics intolerance afoot Europe, one knows deal it. http://www.newsweek.com/2010/09/05/how-marine-le-pen-is-changing-french-politics.print.html B6 Eit What Tea Party Looks Like Europe Marine Le Pen moving father's rabble-rousing, far-right party away fringe, redefining French politics process.

While measures proved popular opinion polls, Sarkozy, ironically, not. His abysmal approval ratings remain low 30s. The younger Le Pen takes great pleasure watching Sarkozy squirm. "I think I get [his] nerves quite bit," says. "My profile much complicated deal father." The old man could painted creature past, purveyor old prejudices "sulfurous" reputation, says Marine. Today, however, Front wants bill "neither left right." If means losing fringe elements (many support Marine's rival, Bruno Gollnisch), well, "tent pis," says. Other right-wing movements Europe also pushing political mainstream.

If Sarkozy finds facing Marine Le Pen presidential race year half now, may find wishing old man stayed around little longer. With Barbie Nadeau Rome
FYI The Christian Science Monitor - CSMonitor.com War terror: Obama softened language, hardened Muslim hearts The Obama administration's shift counterterrorism language sought bridge divide Muslim world soften Americans' fear Islam. But new rhetoric hasn't matched policy, unintended costs home abroad high. By Stuart Gottlieb posted October 14, 2010 9:58 EDT New Haven, Conn. — One defining aspects Obama administration's counterterrorism strategy effort change America's rhetorical approach threat terrorism, particularly Islamic terrorism. "The language use matters," President Obama told Arabic satellite television station Al Arabiya interview first week office. Scrubbed George W. Bush-era terms like "war terrorism," "radical Islam," "jihadist."The White House's 2010 National Security Strategy formally replaced term "Islamic terrorism" "violent extremism." The purpose shift semantics two-fold. First, aimed repackage fight terrorism specific fight Al Qaeda, Islamic extremism, Mr. Obama believes contributed post-9/11 perception America "at war Islam." Indeed, new rhetoric gone hand hand Obama's outreach Muslim world build "a new partnership based mutual respect mutual interest." Second, part broader effort soften Americans' fear Islamic terrorism, Obama officials believe plays directly hands extremists. Language change ineffective Now fair ask whether Obama's use language regarding terrorism proven effective. Startling new polls suggest hasn't. The first, Brookings Institution Washington, shows May 2009 May 2010 number Middle Eastern Arabs expressing optimism Obama's approach toward region dropped 51 percent 16 percent, describing "discouraged" Obama presidency rising 15 percent 63 percent. The second, Pew Research Center, shows August 2010 fewer Americans held favorable view Islam (30 percent) five years earlier Bush administration (41 percent), Americans (35 percent) saying Islam encourages violence religions (in 2002, 25 percent). These starkly negative trend lines suggest limited utility language fighting terrorism. Yes, terrorism propaganda-fueled activity – ongoing battle win hearts minds attract new recruits fight cause. And course language used combating terrorism vital – counterproductive "smoke 'em out" rhetoric Bush administration case point. But rhetoric match policy, appears discount play threats, credibility – thus effectiveness – overall counterterrorism strategy may undermined. It appears Obama administration dug hole. Rhetoric doesn't match policy When looking beyond nuanced language appealing promises, Muslims around world see administration ramped war Afghanistan; killing scores Muslim civilians drone strikes; continues hold 1,000 Muslim detainees Guantanamo, Bagram, prisons; maintains seemingly unconditional support Israel. This critique policies, point match raised expectations Muslim world muddled Obama's oft-stated goal turning Muslims toward America away extremist movements. The price downplaying threat A large price also paid domestically disconnected rhetoric. Despite maintaining nearly Bush's hard-line tactics — USA Patriot Act, warrantless surveillance, indefinite detentions White House consistently played threat, even face clear uptick terrorism activity. For example, following failed 2009 Christmas Day airline bombing, Obama described suspect "isolated extremist," despite ties Al Qaeda. And administration's initial response failed May 2010 Times Square bombing American Muslim trained Pakistan call "one-off' event. Attorney General Eric Holder stated congressional testimony believed recent Islamic terror plots unconnected, unrelated radical Islam. There little doubt administration's unwillingness speak candidly Islamic terrorism taken toll public's trust. A Gallup poll released last month shows Americans favoring Republicans Democrats issue terrorism 55 percent 31 percent — 49 percent 42 percent last fall. Time reverse trend Obama entered office promising fight smarter effective war terrorism, many ways has. His instincts maintain aggressive tactics toning inflammatory rhetoric sound. Yet administration seems overlearned key lesson Bush years — overstating threat terrorism costs attached. So, too, rhetoric understates threat, especially detached policy. It late reverse troubling trend. The White House begin focusing less overly reassuring rhetoric — paid dividends home abroad — candid accounting threats faced policies employed confront them.

For Sunday reading, summary interesting proposal former Jordanian foreign minister Marwan Muasher. "Palestinian-Israeli Direct Talks: The Case Regional Approach"By Marwan Muasher (Carnegie Endowment Bulletin, August 2010) Marwan Muasher – former Jordanian foreign minister, ambassador, deputy prime minister – advocates regional settlement Israeli-Palestinian conflict, capitalizing 2002 Arab Peace Initiative. His approach depends first securing end-game "deposits" parties: The parties would offer hypothetical commitments might willing give onset, "deposited" U.S. committed side willing same. Saudi Arabia's deposit, instance, would outline agree package included details Jerusalem. The Saudi package would also promise secure Arab Muslim backing painful compromises Palestinians would need accept. Muasher advocates similar approach Syrian track—asking Syria deposit end-game commitments return full Israeli withdrawal Golan Heights. In deposits, Saudis Syrians must clearly commit address inclusion Hamas Hezbollah regional agreement. The Arab states would end logistical, financial, military support two groups, would assume responsibility delivering two actors, helping transform political players. Israel's deposit would spell commitment solution based 1967 borders return Golan. According Muasher, deposits would make much easier President Abbas engage talks aimed ending conflict. After given Arab cover, Abbas could provide end-game deposits. According Muasher, absent commitments Arab states, Palestinian positions remain maximalist. Once U.S. deposits sides make reasonable, comprehensive package, put package table cooperation Quartet. Once comprehensive package presented, U.S. focus confidence- building measures move sides toward end game. AM

November 23, 2010 Effort Liberal Balance G.O.P. Groups Begins By MICHAEL LUO In may prove significant development 2012 elections, David Brock, prominent Democratic political operative, says amassed $4 million pledges last weeks moving quickly hire staff set hopes become permanent liberal counterweight airwaves Republican-leaning outside groups spent heavily year's midterm elections. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, former Maryland lieutenant governor eldest Robert F. Kennedy's 11 children, agreed serve chairwoman group, called American Bridge, lending still extremely nascent undertaking weight remains one significant families Democratic politics. Leading Democratic donors already pledged money group include Rob McKay, heir Taco Bell fortune chairman Democracy Alliance, partnership wealthy liberal donors; Robert Dyson, heads Dyson-Kissner-Moran, takeover acquisitions firm New York City; Marcia L. Carsey, television producer gave $1 million Democratic outside groups 2004. Mr. Brock said interview planned formally file papers Federal Election Commission Tuesday set American Bridge known independent-expenditure-only political action committee, meaning able take contributions unlimited size individuals corporations must regularly disclose donors. Certain set debate, however, Mr. Brock appears positioning new organization fund-raising consultants raise money Democratic-oriented media efforts American Bridge also via one nonprofit organizations Mr. Brock currently runs, Media Matters Action Network, disclose donors. The action network, tracks conservative politicians advocacy organizations, organized 501(c)(4) nonprofit group set take expanded role 2012 elections, including potentially running television ads, according internal draft concept paper American Bridge's Media Matter Action Network's plans obtained The New York Times. Mr. Brock said "money money," would actively solicit donors entities and, end, media spending would apportioned accordingly. The moves Mr. Brock recent weeks make concrete effort far part Democratic activists establish kind centralized structure hope become left's answer 2012 groups right U.S. Chamber Commerce, American Crossroads others, significantly outspent Democratic- leaning outside groups year. It early say whether Mr. Brock's group emerge go-to vehicle giant contributions left. Mr. Brock led much-heralded independent group 2008 presidential election failed gain much traction Obama campaign indicated preferred donors give groups. But Mr. Brock, former conservative journalist publicly disavowed right late 1990s, respected political player, drawn plaudits liberal donors running array groups Media Matters umbrella. Mr. Brock pointed various groups associated Media Matters raised combined $23 million year. Its backers include major Democratic donors like George Soros, billionaire recently announced given $1 million group; Peter B. Lewis, billionaire chairman Progressive Insurance, who, like Mr. Soros, gave $20 million Democratic-oriented groups 2004; Hollywood producer Steve Bing. "My donor base already constitutes major individual players historically given hundreds millions dollars types efforts," Mr. Brock said. "They need asked, I doubt step critical time." There also seems widespread agreement among Democratic activists donors need groups heavily involved 2012 elections. White House officials signaled recent weeks Obama administration would object Democratic- leaning outside groups getting involved 2012 elections, change Obama campaign's attitude toward groups 2008. But also indicated would prefer names donors disclosed. The lack disclosure among Republican-leaning outside groups became central Democratic talking point year spending outside groups right exploded midterm elections. But overriding desire part liberal donors activists hold White House win back lost House Senate may trump principles. Most political operatives agree easier raise money option offering anonymity available. "It would sort funny principle stand on, essentially tie one hand behind back," Mr. McKay said. Besides Mr. Brock, numerous Democratic activists discussions setting similar independent efforts. On Monday, instance, Steve Rosenthal, chief executive America Coming Together, Democratic fund- raising vehicle focused voter mobilization 2004 election, convened group political operatives, many active election, Washington restaurant discuss might done 2012. No one, however, apparently gone far Mr. Brock terms raising money formally setting organization. Mr. Brock said $4 million pledges group collected far deposited bank account end first quarter 2011. By way comparison, America's Families First Action Fund, one major Democratic independent efforts House races year, raised $4 million entire cycle mid-October. The internal concept paper American Bridge lays series priorities next year, including initially focusing attacking vulnerable Republicans Senate House, prelude major spending 2012.

sbwhoeor Sunday, September 19, 2010 11:18 PM H: Richard Medley sent around private newsletter. Sid US Election And The Fed Welcome To The New (Old) World September 19, 2010 One main debates inside senior Fed offices much may balance much conservative fiscal policy Republicans take over. This important question facing officials sides fence (far squiggles whirls monthly numbers). But it's spending taxes, important are, it's also implementation Reg Reform Health Care Reform. All going change November. Here details. Amid snarkiness crazy Tea Party candidates may (and, know, LOVE snarkiness) two things lost: 1. The President lost control spending tax agenda 2. The President lost control implementing Reg Reform health care legislation Congress pushed through. All polling parties independent sources point strongly Republicans taking House. Although less likely take Senate, able gain effective control spending, taxes large scale administrative reforms. Let's start spending: The basic fact spending approved Congress starts House. As wrote nearly week ago, House Republican Leader Boehner senior staff made clear us would like freeze spending 2008 levels annual cost savings $340 billion. This one top Republican priorities. Freezing spending 2008 levels happen. However, even unlikely event Republicans take House budget -- -- frozen near FY 2010 levels (i.e. last time money formally appropriated). Since spending bills approved fiscal year starts October, Congress pass "continuing resolution" keeps government running specific appropriations made (the 1995 government shutdown happened appropriations continuing resolution...the government literally runs spending authority). Congress pass CR next weeks likely run formation new Congress (say February March) next year. They could lame duck session, would cutting close cute. Because new Congress - even Republicans fail take full control House - dominated fiscal conservatives, Boehner's CR idea traction. The Senate make moderate, President veto thus shut government sign take hit. In turn two things: (1) frees money Bush tax rollovers (2) helps plan slow freeze implementation reg reform health care reform bills. The first part obvious. The second may less so. People forget implementation rules requires staff increases, staff reg writing, etc that's money. By freezing spending previous levels freeze ability hire new staff seriously obstruct new rule writing process. Add Boehner's commitment overturn two major regulatory reforms you've got tidal wave indecision paralysis (Jesus, talk mixed metaphors although would interesting see one those). The hearings announce simply chilling effect threatening overturn laws accomplish ninety-percent wants get done, potentially give courts time strike parts health care bill appeal. THE SENATE While everyone written Republican control Senate (we haven't), attention Senate look like even consensus 52-54 Democratic majority prevails. The point US Senate function January 2011 given new membership. We got glimpse would look like moderate Republican Scott Brown elected health care public option panned Reg Reform trimmed around edges. The incoming crop members much ardent government spending, debt, taxes regulatory oversight. They make Boehner's job much easier Take quick look new members (and several marry sworn office). While candidates replacing Republican open seats, generally considered conservative predecessors: 1. ck (CO) - likely winner 2. Toomey (PA) - likely winner 3. Rubio (FL) - likely winner 4. Ayotte (NH) - likely winner 5. Blunt (MO) - likely winner 6. Portman (OH) -likely winner 7. Coats (IN) - likely winner 8. Paul (KY) - likely winner 9. Miller (AK) - likely winner 10. Lee (UT) - likely winner 11. Boozman (AR) - likely winner 12. Hoeven (ND) - likely winner 13. Kirk (IL) - 50/50 (lean GOP) 14. Angle (NV) - 50/50 tossup There several Democrat-controlled seats remain play (CA, WI, WA, CT). These races continue develop report picture Election Day becomes clearer. These likely new members join following traditional budget trouble-makers US Senate: 1. DeMint (SC) 2. Coburn (OK) 3. Inhofe (OK) 4. McConnell (KY) 5. Kyl (AZ) 6. McCain (AZ) 7. Thune (SD) 8. Crapo (ID) 9. Vitter (LA) 10. Burr (NC) One aggressive Senator slow body snail's pace, Republicans operated efficiently minority party 41 votes total. In January, least 22 new existing serious road blocks patrolling Senate Floor. The Republican pick-ups make getting 60 votes cloture impossible spending bills. Welcome new reality.
Slaughter, Anne-Marie <SlaughterA@state.gov> Tuesday, November 23, 2010 11:52 PM Abedin, Huma; Sullivan, Jacob J; Mills, Cheryl D Chet Crocker, Scott Lasensky, Sam Lewis OPED MEP Crocker Lasensky Lewis OPED.doc I'm abusing privileges sending two emails one evening, published yet. November 2010 Declaring America's Stand Middle East Peace By Chester A. Crocker, Scott B. Lasensky Samuel W. Lewis Faltering Middle East peace talks need jolt. Washington powerful option moving process forward: taking firm stand end conflict. An American declaration principles—carefully crafted properly marketed--could spark debate thereby change political calculus leaders. As mediator world power, one America's strongest assets ability legitimize ideas rally others support. A central role U.S. conflict must define zone negotiability. This mean imposing peace. Rather, would statement basic principles U.S. believes guide parties toward negotiated solution. America long declared support "two states," must say means practice. Even current talks resume, without American ideas parties unlikely agree broad trade-offs necessary reach peace deal. A quick deal "borders security," many proposed, unlikely without Washington addressing end-game. Otherwise, sides would exposed issues set later discussion, like Jerusalem refugees. Opinion polling consistently showed support peace strongest core issues addressed. An American statement principles would mobilize regional support. It would provide, first time, public framework engaging sponsors Arab Peace Initiative. It would also strengthen ability reassert importance regional support structure bilateral negotiations, especially reviving multilateral contacts meetings involving Israelis neighbors throughout region. Moreover, greater regional engagement peace process carry powerful benefits regional challenges like Iranian nuclear program. A clearer U.S. declaration also surest way protect prospects two-state solution unrelenting onslaught ground pushes parties away peace deal. An American set ideas would anchor present-day demands issues like Jerusalem, security settlements clear vision future. Perhaps urgently, would broaden debate narrow confines settlements question. At minimum, American declaration based 1967 lines, agreed territorial swaps; support compromise Jerusalem allows two capitals two states; include provisions security limitations guarantees; reiterate America's support agreed solution refugee problem; reaffirm long-standing commitment State Israel. But American principles also include caveat, given ultimate interest agreed, viable solution—not particular formula. What would take American ideas succeed? Unlike past efforts, Washington try 'pre-cook' declaration one parties choreograph reactions. In fact, U.S. statement principles would explicitly described country believes support; implication cannot support. Thus, U.S. statement would designed achieve immediate approval adoption parties. Its purpose would clarify America stands, define interests work for. It would aim influencing climate thinking region, sobering illusions encouraging need support. Timing context course key considerations. Assuming current gridlock negotiations persists, time must elapse election results digested, abroad, public attention redirected toward foreboding increasingly dangerous Arab-Israel stalemate. A presidential speech essential dramatize seriousness purpose lay principles. It immediately followed major, high level diplomatic effort persuade key Middle East leaders Quartet UN allies genuine desire regionalize peacemaking effort. To maximize support key members Congress, speech occur Congress adjourns. No consultation stalemated parties beyond routine precede speech, leaks contents must kept absolute minimum purpose undermined. The speech could usefully also remove veil silence shrouds breakthroughs past negotiations; example, progress Annapolis process. As substance, endorsement two-state solution comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace, Obama Administration hinted Palestinian settlement also accompany normalized relations Israel Arab states, putting broader framing around traditionally defined conflict Israel immediate neighbors. The normalization piece puzzle fully articulated part new strategy based presenting American ideas parties. It way entice skeptical Israelis, also leads back long overdue need Washington engage Arab Peace Initiative. If U.S. puts forward peace principles, American leadership ensure diplomatic process defined clear picture possible parties expect gain negotiated settlement, never gain without one. Skeptics say risky present American ideas parties, would pull rug current leaders, exposing withering domestic criticism. Others argue galvanize obstructionists, support compromise, could well precipitate crisis ground. Others simply worry cost American prestige key players react negatively. But risks overstated, complete collapse process would far dangerous, particularly strategic environment shifts favor regional forces seek undermine, rather promote peace. America must limit managing conflict often upended shared interests peace stability. END Chester A.

sbwhoeop Monday, August 23, 2010 10:06 AM H: Yes, vast right wing conspiracy. Sid B6 A must read piece looks Koch brothers control funding tea party right wing. http://www.nowyorkenconlirep2rtin08130/100830fa fpct maysl2pitatIbie=true#IxzzoxQ uvTcbT A REPORTER AT 1.ARGE COVERT OPERATIONS The billionaire brothers waging war Obama. Jane Mayetmo, (.s.. David H. Koch 1996. He brother Charles lifelong libertarians quietly given hundred million dollars right-wing causes. On May 17th, black-tie audience Metropolitan Opera House applauded tall, jovial-looking billionaire tOok stage. It seventieth annual spring gala American Ballet Theatre, David H. Koch celebrated generosity member board trustees; recently donated $2.5 million toward company's upcoming season, given many millions that. Koch received award flanked two gala's co-chairs, Blaine Trump, peach-colored gown, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, emerald green. Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, patron ballet and, coincidentally, previous owner Fifth Avenue apartment Koch bought, 1995, sold, eleven years later, thirty-two million dollars, found small. The gala marked social ascent Koch, who, age seventy, become one city's prominent philanthropists. In 2008, donated hundred million dollars modernize. Lincoln Center's New York State Theatre building, bears name. He given twenty million American Museum Natural History, whose dinosaur wing named him. This spring, noticing decrepit state fountains outside Metropolitan Museum Art, Koch pledged least ten million dollars renovation. He trustee museum, perhaps coveted social prize city, serves board Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where, donated forty million dollars, endowed chair research center named him. One dignitary conspicuously absent gala: event's third honorary co-chair, Michelle Obama. Her office said scheduling conflict prevented attending. Yet First Lady shared stage Koch might created awkward tableau. In Washington, Koch best known part family repeatedly funded stealth attacks federal government, Obama Administration particular. With brother Charles, seventy-four, David Koch owns virtually Koch Industries, conglomerate, headquartered Wichita. Kansas, whose annual revenues estimated hundred billion dollars. The company grown spectacularly since father, Fred, died, 1967, brothers took charge. The Kochs operate oil refineries Alaska, Texas, Minnesota, control four thousand miles pipeline. Koch Industries owns Brawny paper towels, Dixie. cups, Georgia-Pacific lumber, Staimnaster carpet, Lycra, among products. Forbes ranks second-largest private company country, Cargill, consistent profitability made David Charles Koch—who, years ago, bought two brothers—among richest Men America. Their combined fortune thirty-five billion dollars exceeded Bill Gates Warren Buffett. The Kochs longtime libertarians believe drastically lower personal corporate taxes, minimal social services needy, much less oversight industry—especially environmental regulation. These views dovetail brothers' corporate interests. In study released spring, University Massachusetts Amherst's Political Economy Research Institute named Koch Industries one top ten air polluters United States.- And Greenpeace issued report identifying company "kingpin climate science denial." The report showed that, 2005 2008, Kochs vastly outdid ExxonMobil giving money organizations fighting legislation related climate change, unclerwriting'a huge network foundations, think tanks, political front groups. Indeed, brothers funded opposition campaigns many Obama Administration policies—from health-care reform economic-stimulus program----that, political circles, ideological network known Kochtopus. In statement, Koch Industries said Greenpeace report "distorts environmental record companies." And. . David Koch, recent, admiring article New York, protested "radical press" turned family "whipping boys," exaggerated influence American politics. But Charles Lewis, founder Center Public Integrity, nonpartisan watchdog group, said, "The Kochs whole different level. There's one else spent much money. The sheer dimension sets apart. They pattern lawbreaking, political manipulation, obfuscation. I've Washington since Watergate, I've never seen anything like it. They Standard Oil times." weeks Lincoln Center gala, advocacy wing Americans Prosperity Foundation—an organization David Koch started, 2004—held different kind gathering. Over July 4th weekend, summit called Texas Defending American Dream took place chilly hotel ballroom Austin. Though Koch freely promotes philanthropic ventures, lie attend summit, name evidence. And occasion audience roused a,dance performance series speakers denouncing President Barack Obama. Peggy Venable, organizer summit, warned Administration officials "have socialist visiOn country." Five hundred people attended summit, served, part, training session Tea Party activists Texas. An advertisement cast event populist uprising vested corporate power. "Today, voices average Americans drowned lobbyists special interests," said. "But something it." The pitch made mention corporate funders. The White House expressed frustration sponsors largely eluded public notice. David . Axelrod, Obama's senior adviser, said, "What don't say that, part, grassroots citizens' movement brought bunch oil billionaires." In April, 2009, Melissa Cohlmia, company spokesperson; denied Kochs direct links Tea Party, saying Americans Prosperity "an independent organization Koch companies way direct activities." .Later, issued statement: "No funding provided Koch companies, Koch foundations, Charles Koch David Koch specifically support tea parties." David Koch told New York, "I've never tea-party event. No one representing tea party ever even approached me." At lectern Austin, however, Venable—a longtime political operative draws salary Americans Prosperity, worked Koch-funded political groups since 1994—spoke less warily: "We love Tea Parties doing, that's we're going take back America!" declared, crowd cheered. In subsequent interview, described early member movement, joking, "I part Tea Party cool!" She explained role Americans Prosperity help "educate" Tea Party activists policy details, give "next-step training" rallies, political energy could channelled "more effectively." And noted Americans Prosperity provided Tea Party activists lists elected officials target. She said Kochs. "They're certainly people. David's chairman board. I've certainly met them, I'm appreciative Of do." Venable honored several Tea Party "citizen leaders" summit. The Texas branch Americans Prosperity gave Blogger Year Award young woman named Sibyl West. On June 14th, West, writing site, described Obama "cokehead chief." In online thread, West speculated President exhibiting symptoms "demonic possession (aka schizophrenia, etc.)." The summit featured several paid speakers, including Janine Turner, actress best known role television series "Northern Exposure." She declared, "They don't want children know rights. They don't want children know God!" During catered lunch, Venable introduced Ted Cruz, former solicitor general Texas, told crowd Obama "the radical President ever occupy Oval Office," hidden voters secret agenda—"the government taking economy lives." Countering Obama, Cruz proclaimed, epic fight generation!" As crowd rose feet cheered, quoted defiant words Texan Alamo: "Victory, death!" Americans Prosperity worked closely Tea Party since movement's inception. In weeks first Tax Day protests, April, 2009, Americans Prosperity hosted Web site offering supporters "Tea Party Talking Points." The Arizona branch urged people send tea bags Obama; Missouri branch urged members sign "Taxpayer Tea Party Registration" provided directions nine protests. The group continues stoke rebellion. The North Carolina branch recently launched "Tea Party Finder" Web site, advertised "a hub Tea Parties North Carolina." The anti-government fervor infusing 2010 elections represents political triumph Kochs. By giving money "educate," fund, organize Tea Party protesters, helped turn private agenda mass movement. Bruce Bartlett, conservative economist historian, worked National Center Policy Analysis, Dallas-based think tank Kochs fund, said, "The problem whole libertarian movement it's chiefs Indians. There haven't actual people, like voters, give crap it. So problem Kochs trying create movement." With emergence Tea Party, said, "everyone suddenly sees first time Indians there—people provide real ideological power." The Kochs, said, "trying shape control channel populist uprising policies."- A Republican campaign consultant done research behalf Charles David Koch said Tea Party, "The Koch brothers gave money founded it. It's like put seeds ground. Then rainstorm comes, frogs come mud—and they're candidates!" The Kochs political operatives declined requests interviews. Instead, prominent New York public-relations executive close Kochs put forward two friends: George Pataki, former governor New York, Mortimer Zuckerman, publisher real-estate magnate. Pataki, Republican received campaign donations David Koch, called "a patriot cares deeply country." Zuckerman praised David's "gentle decency" "range public interests." The Republican campaign consultant said family's political activities, "To call radar understatement. They underground!" Another former Koch adviser said, "They're smart. This right-wing, redneck stuff works them. They see way get things done without getting dirty themselves." Rob Stein, Democratic political strategist studied conservative movement's finances, said Kochs "at epicenter anti-Obama movement. But it's Obama. They would done Hillary Clinton. They Bill • Clinton. They destroy progressivism." ddly enough, fiercely capitalist Koch family owes part fortune Joseph Stalin. Fred Koch son Dutch printer settled Texas ran weekly newspaper. Fred attended M.I.T., earned degree chemical engineering. In 1927, invented efficient process converting oil gasoline; but, according family lore, America's major oil companies regarded threat shut industry. Unable succeed home, Koch found work Soviet Union. In nineteen-thirties, company trained Bolshevik engineers helped Stalin's regime set fifteen modern oil refineries. Over time, however, Stalin brutally purged several Koch's Soviet colleagues. Koch deeply affected experience, regretted collaboration. He returned U.S. In headquarters company, Rock Island Oil & Refining, Wichita, kept photographs aimed proving Soviet refineries destroyed Second World War. Gus diZerega, former friend Charles Koch, recalled, "As Soviets became stronger military power, Fred felt certain amount guilt helped build up. I think bothered lot." In 1958, Fred Koch became one original members john Birch Society, arch-conservative group known, part, highly skeptical view governance spreading fears Communist takeover. Members considered President Dwight D. Eisenhower Communist agent. In self-published broadside, Koch claimed Communists infiltrated Democrat Republican Parties." He wrote admiringly Benito Mussolini's suppression Communists Italy, disparagingly American civil-rights movement. "The colored man looms large Communist plan take America," warned. Welfare secret plot attract rural blacks cities, would foment "a vicious race war." In 1963 speech prefigures Tea Party's talk secret 'socialist plot, Koch predicted Communists would "infiltrate highest offices government U.S. President Communist, unknown rest us." Koch married Mary Robinson, daughter Missouri physician, four sons: Freddie, Charles, twins, David William. John Damgard, president Futures Industry Association, David's schoolmate friend. He recalled Fred Koch "a real John Wayne type." Koch emphasized rugged pursuits, taking sons big-game hunting Africa, requiring farm labor family ranch. The Kochs lived stone mansion large compound across Wichita's country club; summer, boys could hear friends splashing pool, allowed join them. "By instilling work ethie early age, father big favor, although didn't seem like favor back then," Charles written. "By time I eight, made sure work occupied spare time." David Koch recalled father also indoctrinated boys politically. "He constantly speaking us children wrong government," told Brian Doherty, editor libertarian magazine Reason, author "Radicals Capitalism," 2007 history libertarian movement. "It's something I grew with—a fundamental point view big government bad, imposition government controls lives economic fortunes good." David attended Deerfield Academy, Massachusetts, Charles sent military school. Charles, David, William earned engineering degrees father's alma mater, M.I.T., later joined family company. Charles eventually assumed control, David deputy; William's career company less successful. Freddie went Harvard studied playwriting Yale School Drama. His father reportedly disapproved him, punished financially. (Freddie, spokesperson, denied this:) In 1967, Fred Koch died, heart attack, Charles renamed business Koch Industries, honor father. Fred Koch's made sons extraordinarily wealthy. David Koch joked good fortune 2003 speech alumni Deerfield, where, pledging twenty-five million dollars, made school's sole "lifetime trustee." He said, "You might ask: How David Koch happen wealth generous? Well, let tell story. It started I alittle boy. One day, father gave apple. I soon sold five dollars bought two apples sold ten. Then I bought four apples sold twenty. Well, went day day, week week, month month, year year, father died left three hundred million dollars!" David Charles absorbed father's conservative politics, share views, according diZerega, befriended Charles mid-sixties, meeting browsing John Birch Society bookstore Wichita. Charles eventually invited Kochs' mansion, participate informal political-discussion group. "It pretty clear Charles thought Birch Society bullshit," diZerega recalled. DiZerega, lost touch Charles, eventually abandOned right-wing views, became political-science professor. He credits Charles opening mind political philosophy, set path academia; Charles one three people dedicated first book. But diZerega believes Koch brothers followed wayward intellectual trajectory, transferring father's paranoia Soviet Communism distrust U.S. government, seeing expansion, beginning New Deal, tyrannical threat freedom. In essay, posted Beliefnet, diZerega writes, "As state socialism failed ... target many within organizations shifted kind regulation all. 'Socialism' kept. defined downwards." Members the. John Birch Society developed.an interest school Austrian economists promoted free-market ideals. Charles David Koch particularly influenced work Friedrich von Hayek, author "The Road Serfdom" (1944), argued centralized government planning led, inexorably, totalitarianism. Hayek'S belief unfettered capitalism proved inspirational many conservatives, anti-Soviet dissidents; lately, Tea Party supporters championed work. In June, talk-radio host Glenn Beck, supported Tea Party rebellion, promoted "The Road Serfdom" show; paperback soon became No. 1 best-seller Amazon. (Beck appears fan Kochs; midst arecent on-air parody Al Gore, Beck said, without explanation, "I want thank Charles Koch information." Beck declined elaborate relationship.) Charles David also became devotees radical thinker, Robert LeFevre, favored abolition state didn't like label "anarchist"; called "autarchist." LeFevre liked say "government disease masquerading cure." In 1956, opened institution called Freedom School, Colorado Springs. Brian Doherty, Reason, told "LeFevre anarchist figure won Charles's heart," school "a tiny world people thought New Deal horrible mistake." According diZerega, Charles supported school financially, even gave money take classes there. Throughout seventies, Charles David continued build Koch Industries. In 1980, William, assistance Freddie, attempted take company Charles, who, felt, assumed autocratic control. In retaliation, company's board, answered Charles, fired William. ("Charles runs iron hand," Bruce Bartlett, economist, told me.) Lawsuits filed, William Freddie one side Charles David other. In 1983, Charles David bought brothers' share company nearly billion dollars. But antagonism remained, litigation continued seventeen years, brothers hiring rival private investigators; 1990, walked past one another stony expressions mother's funeral. Eventually. Freddie moved Monaco, income tax. He bought historic, estates France. Austria, elsewhere, filling art, antiques, opera scores, literary manuscripts. William founded energy company, Oxbow, turned yachting; spent estimated sixty-five million dollars win America's Cup, 1992. With Charles undisputed chairman C.E.O., Koch Industries expanded rapidly. Roger Altman, heads investment-banking firm Evercore, told company's performance "beyond phenomenal." Charles remained Wichita, wife two children, guarding privacy supporting community charities. David moved New York City, executive vice-president company C.E.O. Chemical Technology Group. A financial expert knows Koch Industries well told me, "Charles company. Charles runs it." David, described associates "affable" "a bit lunk," enjoyed years life wealthy bachelor. He rented yacht South France bought waterfront home Southampton, threw parties Web site New York Social Diary likened "East Coast version Hugh Hefher's soirees." In 1996, married Julia Flesher, fashion assistant. They live nine- thousand-square-foot duplex 740 Park Avenue, three children. Though David's manner cosmopolitan, genial, Charles, Brian Doherty, interviewed brothers, couldn't think single issue brothers disagreed. As fortunes grew, Charles David Koch became primary underwriters hard-line libertarian politics America. Charles's goal, Doherty described it, tear government "out root." The brothers' first major public step came 1979, Charles persuaded David, thirty-nine, run public office. They become supporters Libertarian Party, backing Presidential candidate, Ed Clark, running Ronald Reagan right. Frustrated legal limits campaign donations, contrived place David ticket, Vice-Presidential slot; upon becoming candidate, could lavish much personal fortune wished campaign. The ticket's slogan "The Libertarian Party one source funds: You." In fact, primary source funds David Koch, spent two million dollars effort. Many ideas propounded 1980 campaign presaged Tea Party movement. Ed Clark told The Nation libertarians getting ready stage "a big tea party," people "sick death" taxes. The Libertarian Party platform called abolition F.B.I. C.I.A., well federal regulatory agencies, Securities Exchange Commission Department Energy. The Party wanted end Social Security, minimum-wage laws, gun control, personal corporate income taxes; proposed legalization prostitution, recreational drugs, suicide. Government reduced one function: protection individual rights. William F. Buckley, Jr., traditional conservative, called movement "Anarcho-Totalitarianism." That November, Libertarian ticket received one per cent vote. The brothers realized brand politics didn't sell ballot box. Charles Koch became openly scornful conventional politics. "It tends nasty, corrupting business," told reporter time. "I'm interested advancing libertarian ideas." According Doherty's book, .Kochs came regard elected politicians merely "actors playing script." A longtime confidant Kochs told Doherty brothers wanted "supply themes words scripts." In order alter direction America, "influence areas policy ideas percolate from: academia. think tanks." fter 1980 election, Charles David Koch receded public arena. But poured hundred million . dollars dozens seemingly independent organizations. Tax records indicate 2008 three main Koch family foundations gave money.to thirty-four political policy organizations, three founded, several direct. The Kochs company given additional millions political campaigns, advocacy groups, lobbyists. The family's subterranean financial role fuelled suspicion left: Lee Fang, liberal blog ThinkProgress, called Kochs billionaires behind hate." Only Kochs know precisely much spent politics. Public tax records show 1998 2008 Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation spent forty-eight million dollars. The Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, controlled Charles Koch wife, along two company employees accountant, spent twenty-eight million. The David H. Koch Charitable Foundation spent hundred twenty million. Meanwhile, since 1998 Koch Industries spent fifty million dollars lobbying. Separately, company's political-action committee, KochPAC, donated eight million dollars political campaigns, eighty per cent Republicans. So far 2010, Koch Industries leads energy companies political contributions, since 2006. In addition, past dozen years Kochs family members personally spent two million dollars political contributions. In second quarter 2010, David Koch biggest individual contributor Republican Governors Association, million-dollar donation. Other gifts Kochs may untraceable; federal tax law permits anonymous personal donations politically active nonprofit groups. In recent decades, members several industrial dynasties spent parts fortunes conservative agenda. In nineteen-eighties, Olin family, owns chemicals-and-manufacturing conglomerate, became known funding right-leaning thinking academia, particularly law schools. And nineties Richard Mellon Scaife, descendant Andrew Mellon, spent millions attempting discredit President Bill Clinton. An Rabin-Havt, vice-president Democratic-leaning Web site Media Matters, said Kochs' effort Unusual, marshalling corporate personal funds: "Their role, terms financial commitments, staggering." Of course, Democrats give money, too. Their prominent donor, financier George Soros, runs foundation, Open Society Institute, spent much hundred million dollars year America. Soros also made generous private contributions various Democratic campaigns, including Obama's. But Michael Vachon, spokesman, argued Soros's giving transparent, "none contributions service economic interests." The Kochs given millions dollars nonprofit groups criticize environmental regulation support lower taxes industry. Gus diZerega, former friend, suggested Kochs' youthful idealism libertarianism largely devolved rationale corporate self-interest. He said Charles, "Perhaps confused making money freedom." Some critics suggested Kochs' approach subverted purpose tax-exempt giving. By law, charitable foundations must conduct exclusively nonpartisan activities promote public welfare. A 2004 report National Committee Responsive Philanthropy, watchdog group, described Kochs' foundations self-serving, concluding, "These foundations give money nonprofit organizations research advocacy issues impact profit margin Koch Industries." The Kochs gone well beyond immediate self-interest, however, funding organizations aim push country libertarian. direction. Among institutions subsidized Institute Justice, files. lawsuits opposing state federal regulations; Institute Humane Studies, underwrites libertarian academics; Bill Rights Institute, promotes conservative slant Constitution. Many organizations funded Kochs employ specialists write position Papers subsequently quoted politicians pundits. David Koch acknowledged family exerts tight ideological control. "If we're going give lot money, we'll make darn sure • spend way goes along intent," told Doherty. "And make wrong turn start things don't agree with, withdraw funding." Kochs' subsidization pro-corporate movement fulfills, many ways, vision laid secret 1971 memo Lewis Powell. Virginia attorney, wrote two months nominated Supreme Court. The antiwar movement turned anger defense contractors, Dow Chemical, Ralph Nader leading public-interest crusade corporations. Powell, writing report U.S. Chamber Commerce, urged American companies fight back. The greatest threat free enterprise, warned, Communism New Left but, rather, "respectable elements society"—intellectuals, journalists, scientists. To defeat them, wrote, business leaders needed wage long-term, • unified campaign change public opinion. Charles Koch seems approached business politics deliberation engineer. "To bring social change," told Doherty, requires "a strategy" "vertically horizontally integrated," spanning "from idea creation policy development education grassroots organizations lobbying litigation political action." The project, admitted, extremely ambitious. "We radical philosophy," said. In 1977, Kochs provided funds launch nation's first libertarian think tank, Cato Institute. According 'Center Public Integrity, 1986 1993 Koch family gave eleven million dollars institute. Today Cato hundred full-time employees, experts policy papers widely quoted respected mainstream media. It describes nonpartisan, scholars times critical parties. But consistently pushed corporate tax cuts, reductions social services, laissez-faire environmental policies. When President Obama, 2008 speech, described science global warming "beyond dispute," Cato Institute took full-page ad Times contradict him. Cato's resident scholars relentlessly criticized political attempts stop global warming expensive, ineffective, unnecessary. Ed Crane, Cato Institute's founder president, told "global-warming theories give government control economy." Cato scholars particularly energetic promoting Climategate scandal. Last year, private e-mails climate scientists University East Anglia, England, mysteriously leaked, exchanges appeared suggest willingness falsify data order buttress idea global warming real. In two weeks e-mails went public, one Cato scholar gave twenty media interviews trumpeting alleged scandal. But five independent inquiries since exonerated researchers, nothing found e-mails data discredit scientific consensus global warming. • Nevertheless, controversy succeeded spreading skepticism climate change. Even though National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration recently issued report concluding evidence global warming unequivocal, Americans convinced time since 1997 scientists exaggerated seriousness global warming. The Kochs promote statistic company's Web site mention role funding played fostering doubt. In 2002 memo, Republican political consultant Frank Luntz wrote long "voters believe consensus global warming within scientific community' status quo would prevail. The key opponents environmental reform, said, question science—a public-relations strategy tobacco industry used effectively years forestall regulation. The Kochs funded many sources environmental skepticism, Heritage Foundation, argued "scientific facts gathered past 10 years support notion catastrophic human-made warming." The brothers given money obscure groups, too, Independent Women's Forum, opposes presentation global warming scientific fact American public schools. Until 2008, group run Nancy Pfotenhauer, former lobbyist Koch Industries. Mary Beth Jarvis, vice-president Koch subsidiary, group's board. Naomi Oreskes, professor history science studies University California, San Diego, co-author "Merchants Doubt," new book chronicles various attempts American industry manipulate public opinion science. She noted Kochs, heads "a company refineries pipelines," "a lot stake." She added, "If answer phase fossil fuels, different group people going making money, shouldn't surprised they're fighting tooth nail." David Koch told New York unconvinced global warming caused human activity. Even been, said, heating planet beneficial, resulting longer growing seasons Northern Hemisphere. "The Earth able support enormously people far greater land area available produce food," said. n mid-eighties, Kochs provided millions dollars George Mason University, Arlington, Virginia, set another think tank. Now known Mercatus Center, promotes "the world's premier university source market-oriented ideas—bridging gap academic ideas real-world problems." Financial records show Koch family foundations contributed thirty million dollar's George Mason, much gone Mercatus Center, nonprofit organization. "It's ground zero deregulation policy Washington," Rob Stein, Democratic strategist, said. It unusual arrangement. "George Mason public university, receives public funds," Stein noted. "Virginia hosting institution Kochs practically control." The founder Mercatus Center Richard Fink, formerly economist. Fink heads Koch Industries' lobbying operation Washington. In addition, president Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, president Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, director Fred C. Mary R. Koch Foundation, director co- founder, David Koch, Americans Prosperity Foundation. Fink, many titles, become central nervous system Kochtopus. He appears supplanted Ed Crane, head Cato Institute, brothers' main political lieutenant. Though David remains board Cato, Charles Koch fallen Crane. Associates suggested Crane insufficiently respectful Charles's management philosophy, distilled book called "The Science Success," trademarked name Market-Based Management, M.B.M. In book. Charles recommends instilling company's corporate culture competitiveness marketplace.. Koch describes M.B.M. "holistic system" containing "five dimensions: vision, virtue talents, knowledge processes, decision rights incentives." A top Cato Institute official told Charles "thinks he's genius. He's emperor, he's convinced he's wearing clothes." Fink, contrast, far embracing Charles's ideas. (Fink, like Kochs, declined to. interviewed.) At 1995 conference philanthropfsts, Fink adopted language economics speaking Mercatus Center's purpose. He said grant-makers use think tanks political-action groups convert intellectual raw materials policy "products." The Wall Street Journal called Mercatus Center "the important think tank you've never heard of," noted fourteen twenty-three regulations President George W. Bush placed "hit list" suggested first Mercatus scholars. Fink told paper Kochs "other means fighting [their] battles," Mercatus Center riot actively promote company's private interests. But Thomas McGarity, law professor University Texas, specializes environmental issues, told "Koch constantly trouble E.P.A., Mercatus constantly hammered agency." An environmental lawyer clashed Mercatus Center called "a means laundering economic aims." The lawyer explained strategy: "You take corporate money give neutral-sounding think tank," "hires people pedigrees academic degrees put credible-seeming studies. But coincide perfectly economic interests funders." In 1997, instance, E.P.A. moved reduce surface ozone, form pollution caused, part, emissions oil refineries. Susan Dudley, economist became top official 'Mercatus Center, criticized proposed rule. The E.P.A., argued, taken account smog-free skies would result cases skin cancer. She projected pollution controlled would cause eleven thousand additional cases skin cancer year. In 1999, District Columbia Circuit Court took 'up Dudley's smog argument. Evaluating E.P.A. rule, court found E.P.A. "explicitly disregarded" "possible health benefits ozone." In another part opinion, court ruled, 2-1, E.P.A. overstepped authority calibrating standards ozone emissions. As Constitutional Accountability Center, think tank, revealed, judges majority previously attended legal junkets, Montana ranch, arranged Foundation Research Economics Environment—a group funded Koch family foundations. The judges claimed ruling unaffected attendance. deas don't happen own," Matt Kibbe, president Freedom Works, Tea Party advocacy group, told me. "Throughout history, ideas need patrons." The Koch brothers, helping create Cato Mercatus, concluded think tanks alone enough effect change. They needed mechanism deliver ideas street, attract public's support. 1984, David Koch Richard Fink created yet another organization. Kibbe joined them. The group, Citizens Sound Economy, seemed like grassroots movement, according Center Public Integrity sponsored principally Kochs, provided $7.9 million 1986 19.93. Its mission, Kibbe said, "was take heavy ideas translate mass America.... We read literature Obama nonviolent revolutions--Saul _Minsky, Gandhi, Martin Luther King. We studied idea Boston Tea Party example nonviolent social change. We learned needed boots ground sell ideas, candidates." Within years, group mobilized fifty paid field workers, twenty-six states, rally voters behind Kochs' agenda. David Charles, according one participant, "very controlling, top down. You can't build organization them. They run it." Around time, brothers faced political crisis. In 1989, Senate Select Committee Indian Affairs investigated business released scathing report accusing Koch Oil "a widespread sophisticated scheme steal crude oil Indians others fraudulent mismeasuring." The Kochs admitted improperly taken thirty-one million dollars' worth crude oil, said accidental. Charles Koch told committee investigators oil measurement "a uncertain art." To defend reputation, Koch IndustrieS hired Robert Strauss, premier Washington lobbyist; company soon opened office city. A grand jury convened investigate allegations, eventually disbanded, without issuing criminal charges. According Senate report, committee hearings Koch operatives delved personal lives committee staffers, even questioning ex-wife. Senate investigators upset Kochs' tactics. Kenneth Batten, counsel Senate committee, said, "These people amassed unaccountable power!' .' By •1993, Bill Clinton became President, Citizens Sound Economy become prototype kind corporate-backed opposition campaigns proliferated Obama era. The group waged successful assault Clinton's proposed B.T.U. tax energy, instance, running advertisements, staging media events, targeting opponents. And mobilized anti-tax rallies outside Capitol—rallies NPR described "designed strike fear hearts wavering Democrats." Dan Glickman, former Democratic congressman Wichita, supported B.I.U. tax, recalled, "I'd Congress eighteen years. The Kochs actually engaged funded opponent. They used lot 'resources effort—their employees, too." Glickman suffered surprise defeat. "I can't prove it, I think I probably victim," said. The Kochs continued disperse money, creating slippery organizations generic-sounding names, made difficult ascertain extent influence Washington. In 1990, Citizens Sound Economy created spinoff group, Citizens Environment, called acid rain environmental problems "myths." When Pittsburgh Post-Gazette investigated matter, discovered spinoff group "no citizen membership own." In 1997, another Senate investigation began looking minority report called "an audacious plan pour millions dollars contributions Republican campaigns nationwide without disclosing amount source," order evade campaign-finance laws. A shell corporation, Triad Management, paid three million dollars attack ads twenty-six House races three Senate races. More half advertising money came obscure nonprofit group, Economic Education Trust. The Senate committee's minority report suggested "the trust financed whole part Charles David Koch Wichita, Kansas." The brothers suspected secretly paid attack ads, aired states Koch Industries business. In Kansas, Triad Management especially active, funds may played decisive role four six federal races. The Kochs, asked reporters given money, refused comment. In i998, however, Wall Street Journal confirmed consultant Kochs' payroll involved scheme. Charles Lewis, Center Public Integrity, described scandal "historic. Triad first time major corporation used cutout"—a front operation—"in threatening way. Koch Industries poster child company run amok." uring Clinton Administration, energy industry faced increased scrutiny regulation. In mid-nineties, Justice Department filed two lawsuits Koch Industries, claiming responsible three hundred oil spills, released estimated three million gallons oil lakes rivers. The penalty potentially high two hundred fourteen million dollars. In settlement. Koch Industries paid record thirty-million-dollar civil fine, agreed spend five million dollars environmental projects. In 1999, jury found Koch Industries guilty negligence malice deaths two Texas teen-agers explosion resulted leaky underground butane pipeline. (In 2001, company paid undisclosed settlement.) And final months Clinton Presidency Justice Department levelled ninety-seven-count indictment company, covering discharge ninety-one tons benzene, carcinogen, refinery Corpus Christi, Texas. The company liable •for three hundred fifty million dollars fines, four Koch employees faced thirty-five years prison. The Koch Petroleum Group eventually pleaded guilty one criminal charge covering environmental violations, including falsification documents, paid twenty-million-dollar fine. David Uhlmann, career prosecutor who, time, headed environmental-crimes section Justice Department, described suit "one significant cases ever brought Clean Air Act." He added, "Environmental crimes almost always motivated economics arrogance, Koch case healthy dose both." During 2000 election campaign, Koch Industries spent nine hundred thousand dollars support candidacies George W. Bush Republicans. During Bush years, Koch Industries fossil-fuel companies enjoyed remarkable prosperity. The 2005 energy bill, Hillary Clinton dubbed Dick Cheney Lobbyist Energy Bill, offered enormous subsidies tax breaks energy companies. The Kochs cast deficit hawks, but, according study Media Matters, companies benefitted nearly hundred million dollars government contracts since 2000. In 2004, Citizens Sound Economy accused illegitimately throwing weight behind Bush's reelection. The group's Oregon branch attempted get Ralph Nader Presidential ballot, order dilute Democratic support John Kerry. Critics argued illegal, tax-exempt nonprofit organization donate services partisan political purposes. (A complaint filed Federal Election Commission; dismissed.) That year, internal rivalries Citizens Sound Economy caused organization split apart. David Koch Fink started new group, Americans Prosperity, hired Tim Phillips run it. Phillips political veteran worked Ralph Reed, evangelical leader Republican activist, co-founding Century Strategies, campaign- consulting company became notorious ties disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Phillips's online biography describes expert "grasstops" "grassroots" political organizing. The Kochs' choice Phillips signalled even greater toughness. The conservative operative Grover Norquist, known praising "throat slitters" politics, called Phillips "a grownup make things happen." Last year, Phillips told Financial Times Americans Prosperity eight thousand registered members. Currently, Web site claims group "1.2 million activists." Whatever size, Kochs' political involvement intense; former employee Cato Institute told Americans Prosperity "was micromanaged Kochs." And brothers' investment may well paid off: Americans Prosperity, concert family's organizations, instrumental disrupting Obama Presidency. In January, 2008, Charles Koch wrote company newsletter America could verge "the greatest loss liberty prosperity since 1930s." That October, Americans Prosperity held conference conservative operatives Marriott hotel outside Washington. Erick Erickson, editor-in-chief conservative blog RedState.com, took lectern, thanked David Koch, vowed "unite fiaht ... armies left!" Sodn Obama assumed office, Americans Prosperity launched "Porkulus" rallies Obama's stimulus-spending measures. Then Mercatus Center released report claiming stimulus funds directed disproportionately toward Democratic districts; eventually, author forced correct report, Rush Limbaugh, citing.the paper, labelled Obama's program "a slush fund," Fox News conservative outlets echoed sentiment. (Phil Kerpen, vice-president policy Americans Prosperity, contributor Fox News Web site. Another officer Americans Prosperity, Walter Williams, often guest-hosts Limbaugh.) Americans Prosperity also created offshoot, Patients United Now, organized Phillips estimated three hundred rallies health-care reform. Atone rally, effigy Democratic congressman hung; another, protesters unfurled banner depicting corpses Dachau. The group also helped organize "Kill Bill" protests outside Capitol, March, Democratic supporters health-care reform alleged spat cursed at. Phillips featured speaker. Americans Prosperity held least eighty events targeting cap-and-trade legislation, aimed making industries pay air pollution create. Speakers group claimed, exaggeration, even back-yard barbecues kitchen stoves would taxed. The group also involved attacks Obama's "green jobs" czar, Van Jones, waged crusade international climate talks. Casting, group champion ordinary workers would hurt environmentalists, Phillips went Copenhagen last year staged protest outside United Nations conference climate change, declaring, "We're grassroots organization.... 1 think it's unfortunate wealthy children wealthy families . want send unemployment rates United States twenty per cent." Grover Norquist, holds weekly meeting conservative leaders Washington, including representatives Americans Prosperity, told last summer's raucous rallies pivotal undermining Obama's agenda. The Republican leadership Congress, said, "couldn't clone without August, people went streets. It discouraged deal-makers"—Republicans might otherwise worked constructively Obama. Moreover, appearance growing public opposition Obama affected corporate donors K Street. "K Street three-billion-dollar weathervane," Norquist said. "When Obama strong, Chamber Commerce said, 'We work Obama Administration.' But changed thousands people went street 'terrorized' congressmen. August changed it. Now Obama weak, people getting tough." As first anniversary Obama's election approached, David Koch came Washington area attend triumphant Americans Prosperity gathering. Obama's poll numbers falling fast. Not .a single Republican senator working Administration health care, much else. Pundits writing Obama's political ineptitude, Tea Party groups accusing President initiating "a government takeover." In speech, Koch said, "Days like today bring reality vision board directors started organization, five years ago." He went on, "We envisioned mass movement, state-based one, national scope, hundreds thousands American citizens walks life standing fighting economic freedoms made nation prosperous society history.... Thankfully, stirrings California Virginia, Texas Michigan, show fellow-citizens beginning see truths do." . While Koch didn't explicitly embrace Tea Party movement day, recently come close so, praising demonstrating "powerful visceral hostility body politic massive increase government power, massive efforts socialize country." Charles Koch, newsletter sent seventy thousand employees, compared Obama Administration regime Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. The Kochs' sense imperilment somewhat puzzling. Income inequality America greater since nineteen-twenties, since seventies tax rates wealthiest fallen middle class. Yet brothers' message evidently resonated voters: recent poll found fifty-five per cent Americans agreed Obama socialist. Americans Prosperity, meanwhile, announced spend additional forty-five million dollars midterm elections, November. Although group legally prohibited directly endorsing candidates, nonetheless plans target fifty House races half dozen Senate races, staging rallies, organizing door-to-door canvassing, running ads aimed "educating voters candidates stand." Though Kochs slowed Obama's momentum, larger political battle far won. Richard Fink, interviewed FrumForum.com spring, said, "If look we've gone year 2000 now, expansion government spending debt burden threatens bankrupt country, doesn't look good all." He went on, "It looks like infrastructure built ruirtitred carried day." He suggested Kochs needed "to get practical, day-to-day issues governing." n 1991, David Koch badly injured plane crash.in Los Angeles. He sole passenger first class survive. As recovering, routine physical exam led discovery prostate cancer. Koch received treatment, settled down, started family, reconsidered life. As told Portfolio, "When you're one survived front plane everyone.else died—yeah, think, 'My God, good Lord spared greater purpose.' My joke I've busy ever since, good work 1 think of, He confidence me." Koch began giving spectacularly large donations arts sciences. And became patron cancer research, focussing prostate cancer. In addition gifts Sloan-Kettering, gave fifteen million dollars New York- Presbyterian Hospital, hundred twenty-five million M.I.T. cancer research, twenty million Johns Hopkins University, twenty-five million M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston. In response generosity, Sloan- Kettering gave Koch Excellence Corporate Leadership Award. In 2004, President Bush named National Cancer Advisory Board, guides National.Cancer Institute. Koch's corporate political roles, however, may pose conflicts interest. For example, time David Koch casting champion fight cancer, Koch Industries lobbying prevent E.P.A. classifying formaldehyde, company produces great quantities, "known carcinogen" humans. Scientists long known formaldehyde causes cancer rats, several major scientific studies concluded formaldehyde causes cancer human beings—including one published last year National Cancer Institute, •whose advisory board Koch sits. The study tracked twenty-five thousand patients average forty years; subjects exposed higher amounts formaldehyde significantly higher rates leukemia. These results helped lead expert panel within National Institutes Health conclude formaldehyde categorized known carcinogen, strictly controlled government. Corporations resisted regulations formaldehyde decades, however, Koch Industries large funder members Congress stymied E.P.A., requiring defer new regulations studies completed. Koch Industries became major producer chemical 2005, bought Georgia-Pacific, paper wood- products company, twenty-one billion dollars. Georgia-Pacific manufactures formaldehyde chemical division, uses produce various wood products, plywood laminates. Its annual production capacity formaldehyde 2.2 billion pounds. Last December, Traylor Champion, Georgia-Pacific's vice-president environmental affairs, sent formal letter protest federal health authorities. He wrote company "strongly disagrees" N.I.H. panel's conclusion formaldehyde treated known human carcinogen. David Koch recuse National Cancer Advisory Board, divest company stock, company directly lobbying government keep formaldehyde market. (A board spokesperson said issue formaldehyde come up.) James Fluff, associate director National Institute Environmental Health Sciences, division N.I.H., told "disgusting" Koch serving National Cancer Advisory Board: "It's good public health. Vested interests board." He 'went on, "Those boards important. They're influential whether N.C.I. goes formaldehyde not. Billions dollars involved formaldehyde." Harold Vannus, director National Cancer Institute, knows David Koch Memorial Sloan-Kettering, used run. He said that, Sloan-Kettering, "a lot people gave us large business interests. The one thing wouldn't tolerate board members tobacco." When told Koch Industries' stance formaldehyde, Varmus said "surprised." David H. Koch Hall Human Origins, Smithsonian's National Museum Natural History, multimedia exploration theory mankind evolved response climate change. At main entrance, viewers confronted giant graph charting Earth's temperature past ten million years, notes far cooler ten thousand years ago. Overhead, text reads, "HUMANS EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO A CHANGING WORLD." The message, amplified exhibit's Web site, "key human adaptations evolved response environmental instability." Only end exhibit, headline "OUR SURVIVAL CHALLENGE," noted levels carbon dioxide higher ever been, projected increase dramatically next century. No cause given development; mention made possible role played fossil fuels. The exhibit makes seem part natural continuum. The accompanying text says, "During period humans evolved, Earth's temperature amount carbon dioxide atmosphere fluctuated together." An interactive game exhibit suggests humans continue adapt climate change future. People may build "underground cities;" developing "short, compact bodies" "curved spines," "moving around tight spaces problem." Such ideas uncannily echo Koch message. The company's January newsletter employees, instance, argueS "fluctuations earth's climate predate humanity," concludes, "Since can't control Mother Nature, let's figure get along changes." Joseph Romm, physicist runs Web site ClirnateProgress.org, infuriated Smithsonian's presentation. "The whole exhibit whitewashes modern climate issue," said. "I think Kochs wanted seen sort high-minded company, associated greatest natural-history science museum country. But truth is, exhibit underwritten big-time polluters, underground .funders action stop efforts deal threat humanity. I think Smithsonian drawn line." Cristian Samper, museum's director, said exhibit climate change, described Koch "one best donors we've had, tenure here, he's interested content, completely hands off." He noted, "1. don't know details.of involvement issues." The Kochs long depended public's knowing details them. They content operate David Koch called "the largest company you've never heard of." But growing prominence Tea Party, increased awareness Kochs' ties movement, brothers may find harder deflect scrutiny. Recently, President °barna took aim Kochs' political network. Speaking Democratic National Committee fund-raiser, Austin, warned supporters Supreme Court's recent ruling Citizens United case—which struck laws prohibiting direct Corporate spending campaigns—had made even easier big companies hide behind "groups harmless-sounding names like Americans Prosperity." Obama said, "They don't say who, exactly, Americans Prosperity are. You don't know it's foreign-controlled corporation"—or even, added, "a big oil company."

Regardless, supporters still thought bill would pass House Republican leadership come it. But one hour vote, every Republican House office received message bill GOP leadership, known Whip Alert, saying leadership Nyould vote "no" bill encouraging Republicans same.

Pakistan's envoy Washington, Ambassador Husain Haggai* reacted report saying Pakistan engage isla.mist groups North Waziristan, including •Hartgani network (no relation), sufficient support areas Pakistan's government effort, confident mission completed effectively. "Pakistan made clear fighting terrorists threat existence modern democratic nation. We fight groups parts country," Haqqani said exclusive interview The Cable.

Haqqani said Pakistani army, taken fight six seven regions inside Pakistan domestic militant groups operate suffered thousands casualties process, simply position expand war extremists now. "Right now, it's question operational capability readiness. Our armed forces engaged dealing flood relief work," said. "We see resources allocate part country, rather political factors responsible waiting period." He also noted "there fragile consensus Pakistan favor military action regional elements," Pakistan's government choice make decision attack North Waziristan groups timeline prioritized Pakistani considerations American ones. "Sometimes it's easy allies tell us us tell allies do. But everyone makes decisions based perceptions analysis ground realities," Haqqani said. In several discussions Pakistani officials, even complicated picture Pakistani position attacking groups North Waziristan emerges. The Pakistanis largely believe U.S. government unrealistic terms timelines wants cracking terrorist safe havens along Afghanistan- Pakistan border, existed decades. , "There always gap two countries Americans want things done quickly done way," another Pakistani government official said. ; A third senior Pakistani official said many Pakistanis feel ()barna administration placing much blame Pakistan lank progress 'U.S.-led war Afghanistan.

The United States provided Pakistan several billions dollars military economic aid support war domestic insurgents. But many Pakistani government criticized say characterize slow arrival funds, say case small address Pakistan's severe problems. "It's simplistic measure success amount assistance provided Pakistan," one Pakistani official said. In remarks delivered rollout strateu review Thursday, President Obama diplomatic discussing administration's ongoing drive push Pakistan North Waziristan. "Increasingly, Pakistani government recognizes terrorist networks border regions threat countries, especially Pakistan. We've welcomed major Pakistani offensives tribal regions.

The White House recognizes efforts fallen short far. "The bottom line Pakistan country little influence, little access little credibility," one Obama's aides to■..-:), The New York Times. The administration's official line, therefore, agree Pakistani government express sensitivity claim simply can't expand war extremists time. "We would like move tomorrow, would like take people tomorrow," new U.S. Ambassador Pakistan Cameron Munter. "But understand they're telling us honestly capacity military, able, convinced move in." But many Washington, open-ended delay Pakistan.s promise expand military operations North. Waziristan represents strategic choice, result military's operational limitations.

sbwhoeop Wednesday, September 8, 2010 2:35 PM H: First review speech. Goad used Acheson. Sid aary's Homerun Speech Tunku Varadarajan September 8, 2010 I 12:16pm Clinton speaks Council Foreign Relations September 8, 2010 Washington, , DC. (Mark Wilson / Getty Images) The secretary State delivered best speech Obama administration morning. Tunku Varadarajan "new American moment"—and she's better boss. Behold Hillary Doctrine. And heap abundant gratitude—and rose petals hand—on firm, unfussy, deeply reassuring woman offered world. In 20 months since administration began administering (a verb I use loosest sense), speech Wednesday morning Hillary Clinton, delivered Council Foreign Relations, first time given unreserved lift heart members. It was, far, best speech administration. Whereas president frequently wrung elegant hands, rounds world reassure foreign leaders America cuddly bunny heart, secretary State declared Wednesday living "a new American moment—a moment global leadership essential." There bowing potentates robes; was, instead, promise "we everything exercise traditions American leadership home abroad." What piquant fact Hillary understands Obama president. It growing sense Hillary would made much, much better president Obama. Try size: "The United States can, must lead new century." In order that, Clinton promised "a new global architecture," "built last withstand stress." And muscular departure way administration—for fear seeming Bush-like—has shrinking unembarrassed propagation American values, uttered plainspoken, unadorned words: "Democracy needs defending." X Human rights, too, came robust airing: China scolded, exhorted follow "the rules road" aspiration great power; Russia, invasion Georgia. The message: We may live multipolar world, higher standards far would style equals. Clinton used phrases like "American might," words accustomed hearing Republicans—words we've come believe many Democrats can't bear voice. How refreshing, therefore, reach vocabulary pride American citizens would applaud. Hillary Clinton invoked name Dean Acheson reference need "good, old-fashioned diplomacy," certainly air Achesonian, statesman, speech. Good, old-fashioned diplomacy, noted, contrast Obama's apparent preference seeing America nation like other, bit bigger, richer, better-armed. Clinton's "old-fashioned" diplomacy based, contrast, unquestionable premise America world's leader. Not primus inter pares; primus. In speech, Clinton referred sources "American might." The first, course, "economic power." But hailing second—America's "moral authority"—that invigorating. It Acheson said: "The important aspect relationship president secretary state understand president." What piquant here, administration, fact, plain behold, Hillary understands Obama president. It growing sense Hillary would made much, much better president Obama. Tunku Varadarajan national affairs correspondent writer large The Daily Beast.

TO: Anne-Marie Slaughter FROM: Melanne Verveer DATE: November 4, 2010 RE: Gender Integration QDDR The Secretary declared time time empowerment women "at heart foreign policy United States." Our collective task realize principle integrating gender policies programs State Department USAID enduring way. We concerned current draft QDDR falls short call. In existing draft, Office Global Women's Issues falls new Under Secretary Civilian Security, Democracy Human Rights retaining Ambassador-at-Large Global Women's Issues reports directly Secretary. This new structure misses simple important reality women half world's population major security, economic social challenges century cannot solved without them. These issues cut across work department touch virtually regions, though place special emphasis regions women girls vulnerable, countries experiencing conflict transition. Locating office within one bureau makes impossible Office implement charge — integrate gender effectively work entire State Department. Therefore, gender must integrated throughout regional functional bureaus rather located within one bureau. Women integral diplomatic efforts—from traditional bilateral multilateral relationships, strategic dialogues, public diplomacy, relations civil society, community leaders non-state actors. Women also important consider policy initiatives, including global health, food security, climate change, economic issues, human rights, peace security. We must institute rigorous institutional mechanisms ensure bureaus, regional functional, consider gender diplomacy development. In order integrate gender effectively throughout work Department, recommend following approach planning, budgeting, structure evaluation: Maintain visibility focus gender. Retain Ambassador-at-Large Global Women's Issues reports Secretary. This position embodies commitment advocacy gender equality essential part diplomacy development signals understanding important national security United States. In addition, office advances coherent coordinated strategy gender throughout State Department USAID. [DONE] Ensure gender effectively addressed throughout bureaus missions. We recommend following structural changes State. First, make Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary (PDAS) regional functional bureaus responsible accountable bureaus' work gender. The Office Global Women's Issues would serve resource PDAS issues. Second, assign specialized gender liaisons regional bureaus purposes integration, needed. Third, include training capacity development employees gender Issues (in Foreign Civil Service well political appointees). Fourth, evaluate PDAS bureau gender integration policies programs (including, example, component Performance Evaluation System). Similarly, require Chief Mission responsible accountable mission's work gender, assign personnel expertise manage work gender, require personnel receive training gender issues, evaluated work. A parallel structure put place USAID, diplomacy development work gender coordinated complimentary. [THIS IS RECOMMENDATION, WITH SOME VARIATION, MADE FOR MANY AREAS — PUBLIC DIPLOMACY, MULTILATERAL AFFAIRS, AND OTHERS — CHALLENGE WILL BE TO IDENTIFY HOW TO ADDRESS EFFECTIVELY AND CREAT A PDAS JOB THAT IS MEANINGFUL GIVEN THE NEW RESPONSIBILITIES SOUGHT TO BE IMPOSED THROUGH THAT POSITION] Include gender strategic planning budget allocation. We recommend continuing requirement initiated last year bureaus include plan gender integration annual Strategic Plan Budget proposal. Each bureau required describe policies programs improve gender equality strengthen work generally. They also required, extent possible, outline portion policies programs target affect women girls. [THIS ALREADY IS IN PLACE AND WOULD BE RETAINED] Measure impact. Develop indicators long-term evaluation systems measure impact programs women girls.

With Mayor Richard Daley saying would endorse successor Feb. 22 city election, various political factions engaged private meetings flurry phone calls aimed separating contenders pretenders. "There lot candidates," Daley said first City Council meeting since announcing would seek seventh term. "Look City Council. All 50 candidates right now. They want candidates mayor not? This best job America, right here." In anteroom behind City Council chambers, scene controlled chaos dozen aldermen — white, black Latino — happily stepped meeting give interviews anyone wanted listen could city's next mayor. But prospective candidates — following old political adage it's "better looked overlooked" — weren't limited City Hall. In Washington, White House chief staff Rahm Emanuel touted another Chicagoan, President Barack Obama's political guru David Axelrod, skills personality big-city mayor. Amid early jockeying, bluffing bullying, veteran Aid. Richard Mell, 33rd, outlined nuts bolts reality mounting mayoral campaign weeks Nov. 22 deadline submitting petitions. "Someone's got serious money. This isn't something decide," Mel! said. "It takes full- scale ward-by-ward operation identify votes get vote." Mell also talked qualities look winning candidate — someone "unifier" "can't looked looking one segment city." Still, many politicians beginning assessment gauging mood political base. "I don't know it's important it's African-American candidate candidate going fair African-American community," said Aid. Walter Burnett, 27th, head council's black caucus, met private Hotel Allegro across City Hall. "For anyone run mayor city Chicago groundswell people city support ... Everyone opportunity." At City Hall, amid swarm politicians reporters, U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, South Side Democrat, said "critical" try find African-American contender would work black community's interests. But council's black caucus agreed try come list topics, improving education, prospective candidates address. Latino council members met lunch agreed meet within next weeks, giving potential candidates time develop presentation make them. "If there's Hispanic runs, probably get majority Hispanic vote," said Ald. Danny Solis, 25th. "I think likely probably, look numbers, won't Hispanic runoff," Solis said. "But I think play important role" backing one remaining candidates. But sentiments didn't deter one city's prominent Latino politicians declaring plans run. City Clerk Miguel del Valle told Tribune planned make formal announcement "down road." Mell many others expect field February city election fragmented candidate reach winning margin 50 percent plus one vote. If outright winner, top two vote-getters proceed April 5 runoff election. One prominent Northwest Side committeeman, asked identified early stage campaigns, said measure candidates real seeking ego boost measured two numbers: 25,000 $7 million. Though 12,500 signatures needed February primary, politicians routinely get double number ensure make ballot. As $7 million, committeeman said, $4 million would needed ensure first second place finish Feb. 22, followed campaign $3 million April runoff. "I'm getting lot calls lunch," said committeeman. "I've told call back get signatures talk fundraising." Aid. Patrick Levar, 45th, running mayor, said power vacuum reminds Mayor Harold Washington died Eugene Sawyer picked replace him. "There's lot people going jockeying position, I've learned years sit listen see put different coalitions together," said Levar, also Northwest Side ward's Democratic committeeman. "Whoever raise amount money put coalition together person going win." While many politicians starting discussions, key Democratic committeemen said hadn't heard Emanuel, one prominent potential candidates. Emanuel, former top political aide Daley Northwest Side congressman, previously said he'd like mayor avoided spotlight since Daley's announcement. Robert Gibbs, White House press secretary, told reporters aboard Air Force One expected Emanuel "take time think wants future." But Axelrod, previously served Daley's political adviser, told ABC News Emanuel decided leave White House mayoral bid, "the president support decision." Saying mayors "larger life personalities," Axelrod said Emanuel "has combination skills personality mindset success chooses go route."

sbwhoeop Saturday, September 11, 2010 2:20 PM H: On NYT website within last hour, tomorrow's paper. Paid TV ads, please. Sid September 11,2010 G.O.P. Leader Is Tightly Bound Lobbyists By ERIC LIPTON WASHINGTON — House Democrats preparing late last year first floor vote financial regulatory overhaul Representative John A. Boehner Ohio Republican leaders summoned 100 industry lobbyists Capitol Hill private strategy session. The bill's passage House already seemed inevitable. But Mr. Boehner deputies told Wall Street lobbyists trade association leaders teaming up, could still perhaps block final passage least water down. "We need get speak this," Mr. Boehner said December afternoon, according three people familiar remarks, also warning cutting side deals Democrats. That sort alliance — won skirmishes, though lost war regulatory bill — business usual Mr. Boehner, House minority leader would-be speaker Republicans win House November. He maintains especially tight ties circle lobbyists former aides representing nation's biggest businesses, including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R. J. Reynolds, MillerCoors UPS. They contributed hundreds thousands dollars campaigns years, provided rides corporate jets, socialized luxury golf resorts waterfront bashes leading fund-raising efforts Boehner Speaker campaign, soliciting checks $37,800 each, maximum allowed. Some lobbyists readily acknowledge routinely seeking office's help — calling congressman aides often several times week — advance agenda Washington. And many cases, Mr. Boehner helped out. As Democrats increasingly try cast Ohio congressman face Republican Party — President Obama mentioned name eight times speech last week — Mr. Boehner becomes visible, ties lobbyists, cultivated since arrived 1991, coming attack. The woman hopes replace, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, derided Friday met "countless times special-interest lobbyists effort stop tough legislation" would regulate corporations protect consumers. And Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, spokeswoman, charged "epitomizes smoked-filled, backroom, special-interest deal making turns voters Washington." Mr. Boehner, declined interviewed article, lobbyist allies ridicule criticism politically motivated desperate Democrats. His actions, say, simply reflect pro-business, antiregulatory philosophy espoused three decades, dating back Mr. Boehner, son tavern owner, ran small plastics company Ohio. And fielding requests lobbyists nothing unusual, says. "I get lobbied every day somebody," said last month speech Cleveland. "It could wife. It could bellman. It goes day, everyday, everyplace." Mr. Boehner — 60-year-old, perpetually tanned, sharply tailored, chain-smoking golfer — fiery Newt Gingrich unrelenting arm-twister Tom DeLay, two Republican predecessors top House posts. It reputation "Chamber Commerce" Republican fund-raising skills — raised $36 million Republican causes election cycle, almost anyone else party — explain, part, rise. If elected party's leader House, Mr. Boehner certainly lean industry allies help builds coalitions necessary push legislation Congress, office acknowledges. His friends say nothing wrong that. "Does lot relationships city? Yes, absolutely," said Mark lsakowitz, friend whose Republican firm represents three dozen financial, telecommunications, energy consumer products companies diverse Coca-Cola Zurich Financial Services. "But I think good lawmakers do." Mr. Boehner won first national headlines back 1996 caught handing checks tobacco lobbyists fellow Republicans House floor. Then fourth-ranking House Republican, Mr. Boehner said broken rules simply assisting lobbyist friends, contributing Republicans' campaigns. His business-friendly reputation enhanced weekly powwows organized Capitol Hill nicknamed Thursday Group, gathering conservative leaders business lobbyists relied help push party's legislative agenda. The Thursday gathering disbanded Republican power struggle cost leadership position. But continued routinely meet business leaders, particularly role chairman Education Workforce Committee, returned power House G.O.P. leader 2006. Several onetime Thursday regulars, along newcomers, among close-knit group routinely call Mr. Boehner's office client matters, write checks campaign socialize him. That tight circle includes Mr. lsakowitz; Bruce Gates, lobbyist cigarette maker Altria; Nicholas E. Calio, Citigroup lobbyist; two former aides, Marc Lampkin Sam Geduldig, financial services lobbyists. The tobacco industry particularly well represented, Mr. Gates John Fish, lobbyist R. J. Reynolds, maker Camel cigarettes, group. People affiliated companies contributed least $340,000 Mr. Boehner's political campaigns, Mr. Gates top individual donor among thousands Mr. Boehner's political career, according tally Center Public Integrity. While many lawmakers party networks donors, lobbyists former aides represent corporate interests, Mr. Boehner's ties seem especially deep. His clique even nickname Capitol Hill, Boehner Land. The members inner circle said association Mr. Boehner translates open access staff. "He likes bring similarly minded people together try advance legislation oppose it," said Drew Maloney, lobbyist Ogilvy Government Relations. "That get things done." One lobbyist club — lauding staff member Mr. Boehner's office routinely calls ask help — ticked list recent issues won lawmaker's backing: combating fee increases oil industry, fighting proposed cap debit card fees, protecting tax breaks hedge fund executives opposing cap greenhouse gas emissions. Still, Mr. Boehner party minority, often lost fights. But despite recent string defeats House floor, Mr. Boehner benefited alliance lobbyists. From 2000 2007, Mr. Boehner flew least 45 times, often wife, Debbie, corporate jets provided companies including R. J. Reynolds. (As required, Mr. Boehner reimbursed part costs.) In addition, last decade, taken 41 trips paid corporate sponsors industry groups, often popular golf spots. Those trips make one top House beneficiaries travel, recently curbed result changes ethics rules Washington. Mr. Boehner continues travel popular golf destinations corporate-subsidized tab, although paid political action committee, Freedom Project. In last 18 months, spent least $67,000 Ritz Carlton Naples Florida, least $20,000 Robert Trent Jones Golf Club Gainesville, Va., least $29,000 Muirfield Village Golf Club Dublin, Ohio, federal records show, fund-raising events. In June, prospects Republican takeover House rising, Mr. Boehner moved accelerate fund- raising effort, starting called Boehner Speaker campaign. The idea use high profile draw large donations would mostly allocated help elect House Republicans. He turned group lobbyists, former aides friends July meeting headquarters Republican National Committee. "The wave there, rebellion country, good candidates," Mr. Boehner told supporters, one lobbyists present meeting recalled. "But I don't want miss once-in-a-lifetime opportunity raised enough money. They might able stop us wall money." Mr. Calio Citigroup among first write large check. So far, party spokesman said, campaign raised nearly $2 million. Mr. Boehner helped raise millions last six weeks Republican House candidates across country party, appearing 40 fund-raisers. The Boehner Speaker campaign offers donors give maximum amount special perks, like "meetings Leader Boehner much much more." But lobbyist friends former aides said incentives mean much, already plenty access Mr. Boehner. They want see speaker House. "He knows going tough election," said Samuel J. Baptista, friend, golf partner lobbyist whose clients include Goldman Sachs Discover Financial. "But people underestimate really peril."

I don't know time read longer paper Louise Diamond I sent you, boiled basic arguments 700 words.

You asked this. It Walter Isaacson. New BBG chief wants money combat "enemies" China Russia Posted By Josh Rogin Tuesday, October 5, 2010 - 4:43 PM The Broadcasting Board Governors (BBG) new chairman Walter Isaacson, former CNN Time magazine chief calling even money BBG combat public diplomacy efforts America's "enemies," identifies Iran, Venezuela, Russia, China. The BBG, oversees $700 million annual budget run organizations Voice America, Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia, funds breakthrough reporting dangerous parts world, time facing increased competition governments' forays international broadcasting. Isaacson said countries stepping international broadcasting efforts Congress must allow U.S. government same. "We can't allow out-communicated enemies," said. "You've got Russia Today, Iran's Press TV, Venezuela's TeleSUR, course, China launching international broadcasting 24-hour news channel correspondents around world [and has] reportedly set aside six ten billion [dollars] -- we've go Capitol Hill number -- expand overseas media operations." Isaacson said combating internet censorship would major focus BBG leadership China Iran prime targets. "China, Iran, countries block democratic impulses using later technologies, Beijing deployed armies cyber militias go country's cyber dissidents," said. "The BBG forefront combating this. Through constant innovation technical evolution, engineers opening Internet gateway audiences China Iran." "We know stand fight Internet freedom," Isaacson said. "Wherever firewall, it's duty storm it, denounce circumvent it." Isaacson speaking last week's 60th anniversary celebration Radio Free Europe, credited contributing end Cold War. He made clear BBG's outlets stick reporting news objectively, even conflicts foreign policy Obama administration. "It's sometimes said international broadcasting difficult position law tradition it's tasked two separate missions might conflict: first all, covering news highest journalistic standards secondly, part America's public diplomacy accurately conveying policies values world," Isaacson said. "Let say you, fellow journalists, I stress stress primacy first missions, mission credible journalists, fact, it's way carry second mission. You can't unless you're credible telling truth, end, truth side." Pressed The Cable explain exactly means, especially light reports Obama administration sought influence BBG reporting disputed Iranian presidential elections, Isaacson promised wouldn't hesitate air views contradict American foreign policy BBG stations. He said goals American foreign policy objectives credible journalism overlap 90 percent time -- 10 percent, choice must made. "I feel it's role BBG always make choice side credible journalism, would private sector," Isaacson said. "We never compromise credibility. And so, probably help foreign policy interests United States. But it's ever real conflict, goal one protect credibility."

Mr. Vargas Llosa offered glass red wine. Then proceeded discuss believes literature change world. Mr. Vargas Llosa's Nobel Prize great victory—and talented prolific author. His work perhaps greatest rebuttal believe literature exists periphery history politics, claim "no time" fiction. In New Republic essay 2001, Mr. Vargas Llosa argued granting literature "an important place life nations." He wrote, 'Without it, critical mind, real engine historical change best protector liberty, would suffer irreparable loss." Mr. Vargas Llosa's novels reflect deep, personal hatred dictatorships staunch belief value individual liberty. He hardly novelist shed light themes, I would argue among successful. Columnist Mary Anastasia O'Grady anti-Communist Peruvian writer. A case point "Conversation Cathedral," work Mr. Vargas Llosa said would rescue first fire. The novel set Peru, dark days Manuel Odria dictatorship 1950s, Mr. Vargas Llosa grew up. He told book wanted describe dictatorships impregnate "every act life." To demonstrate this, Mr. Vargas Llosa paints around Odria rather confronting outright. The book opens grim landscape "uneven faded buildings" describes "dull defeated eyes tables Zela bar, hands reach ashtrays glasses beer." The narrative, rapidly jumps past present, describes stalled, confused world. You don't know trust. Mr. Vargas Llosa attacks politics openly "The Feast Goat," explicitly details horrors Trujillo regime Dominican Republic. Rafael Trujillo notorious victimization women, see life rule eyes one young girl unlucky enough crossed path. "The woman almost always first victim dictatorship," Mr. Vargas Llosa told me. For some, Mr. Vargas Llosa's victory controversial political background outspoken views. He unsuccessfully ran president Peru 1990, losing Alberto Fujimori. During campaign Mr. Vargas Llosa gained notoriety emphasis market economy, free trade private property. He less controversial support invasion Iraq, saw necessary ending called "monstrous dictatorship" Saddam Hussein. Mr. Vargas Llosa left politics, believes better shape world pen.

sbwhoeo1 Friday, 0c 3 10 4:08 PM H: The Boehner poll. Sid raw Westen Psychologist neuroscientist; Emory University Professor Posted: October 8, 2010 09:23 AM dJnLM L , -. -1.117.=1MIC2VAILISIrie ll=a===.1 According news reports, today Republican minority leader Coppertone model John Boehner give "closing argument" American people throw Democrats kill Obama-Pelosi-Reid "job- killing agenda." He returning working class roots, speaking piping manufacturing plant, unusual venue days man seen much frequently gatherings Wall Street executives open checkbooks males-only country club works tan making rounds clubs industry lobbyists. Either Speaker-to-be following model Michael Steele free-lancing, Karl Rove Republicans believe safe even advantageous bring public White House made effort put Boehner's face Republican majority might look like, president invoking name eight times one speech. I admit time I agnostic whether made sense try brand late date, Boehner minimal name recognition among voters. But White House doubt responding three realities. First, Boehner unknown Americans, means that, unlike Republicans news, well branded GOP -- means Democrats might actually brand someone something first rather playing catch-up. Second, Boehner would indeed highest-ranking Republican GOP assume control House (other course Karl Rove, directing traffic right side street Washington again). And third, concrete face always better abstraction telling story, perhaps Sarah Palin, Republicans could alternately accept decline leader party, Boehner's tanned visage history errand-boy virtually every major corporate special interest two decades Washington (including stint Marlboro Man, handing tobacco lobby campaign checks fellow Republicans floor House) made potential counter-villain Republican's bogeywoman, Nancy Pelosi. I remained agnostic week, colleagues Media Matters Action Network I conducted national 5urye:y 1,000 registered voters, selected match demographics voting likely voting populations. The goal see effectively could speak voters Boehner symbol standard-bearer GOP also water-boy corporate America. (The results surprisingly similar whether looked registered voters likely voters, although others described, precisely determine "likely voter" election much art science, point good messaging point actually change dynamics likely voting, reflect them.) As detailed memo published Politico, found clear: Boehner target well worth defining, readily stands precisely Americans perceive reasons would hold noses vote Congressional Republicans (perhaps group left poll worse Congressional Democrats swing voters). We tested paragraph-length narratives single-sentence language designed capture essence narratives, case, tested toughest opposition language could test against: words Boehner, Cantor, Limbaugh others combined defining "Obama-Pelosi-Reid" agenda. What found, brief: could beat tough GOP narrative "job-killing" socialists White House Congress 15 20 points two narratives starring Boehner leading role (with best supporting bad actor going one narratives Karl Rove corporate allies), could win 15 different sentence-long descriptions "what's matter Boehner" margins ranging 10 60 points tough conservative attack Obama-Pelosi-Reid axis conservative evil. The narratives moved likely voters -- including swing voters, preferred double-digits tough Republican rhetoric -- made clear whose voices Boehner would speaking Speaker (e.g., Wall Street executives convened try block Wall Street reform). They harnessed populist anger hijacking Washington corporate special interests enlivened tea partiers palpable across political spectrum, focused extremism party Boehner would Speak for. A narrative brought Karl Rove picture slightly polarizing swing voters slightly powerful likely Democratic voters. In ways surprising success single-line statements need Speaker John Boehner really speaks (although single-line statements came narratives, likely reflect power branding, even course brief online encounter voters). They ranged relatively lofty aspirational (e.g., "We need Speaker also listener, hear voices ordinary Americans" -- theme colleagues I found highly resonant across political spectrum message testing role money politics) -- harder-edged (e.g., "The Speaker House heartbeat away Presidency. Unfortunately, know John Boehner's heart is, isn't middle class," "John Boehner understands deficits. He's spent nearly 20 years Washington creating them.") If there's message message research, short-term long-term. In short run, Democrats want hang onto seats November, would well define election terms middle class small business versus billionaires big corporations hijacking democracy; use Boehner poster child party whose primary commitment latter whose tan testament commitment; avoid giving voters reason regret vote give Democrats time, supporting things say stand avoiding golden mean public interest special interests finance campaigns sides aisle. In longer run, branding matters. One biggest strategic messaging mistakes last two years failure Democrats brand opponents opponents busy branding -- particular failure brand Bush Recession natural consequence faded Republican economic principles. Two years ago, virtually uncontested political proposition, voters made clear handing Democrats White House supermajorities House Senate. Today, public split middle caused recession. Reality doesn't brand itself. Hopefully won't take debacle November another 10 million jobs lost reality unveil brief political moment progressives second bite apple.

sbwhoeop Saturday, October 9, 2010 10:50 AM H: Dems demand Boehner remove GOP Nazi reenactor. Put Boehner blitzkrieg. Sid Why This GOP House Candidate Dressed Nazi? By Joshua Green An election year already notable menagerie extreme unusual candidates add another one: Rich lott, Republican nominee Congress Ohio's 9th District, Tea Party favorite, years donned German Waffen SS uniform participated Nazi re-enactments. Rich lott, second right, Nazi SS Waffen uniform. lott, whose district lies Northwest Ohio, involved group calls Wiking, whose members devoted re-enacting exploits actual Nazi division, 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking, fought mainly Eastern Front World War 11. lott's participation Wiking group mentioned campaign's website, name photographs removed Wiking website.When contacted The Atlantic, lott confirmed involvement group number years, said interest Nazi Germany historical subscribe tenets Nazism. "No, absolutely not," said. "In fact, there's disclaimer [Wiking] website. And you'll find almost reenactment website. it's purely historical interest World War II." Rich lott wife, shown campaign website. lott, member Ohio Military Reserve, added, "I've always fascinated fact relatively small country strictly military point view accomplished incredible things. I mean, took Europe Russia, really took combined effort free world defeat them. From purely historical military point view, that's incredible." lott says group chose Wiking division part fought Eastern Front, mainly Russian Army, U.S. British soldiers. The group's website includes lengthy history Wiking unit, recruitment video, footage goose-stepping German soldiers marching Warsaw victory parade Poland fell 1939. The website makes scant mention atrocities committed Waffen SS, includes glancing reference "twisted" nature Nazism. Instead, emphasizes Wiking unit fought Bolshevist Communism: Nazi Germany problem recruiting multitudes volunteers willing lay lives ensure "New Free Europe", free threat Communism. National Socialism seen - many Holland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, eastern European Balkan countries protector personal freedom way life, despite true underlying totalitarian (and quite twisted, cases) nature movement. Regardless, thousands upon thousands valiant men died defending respective countries name better tomorrow. We salute idealists; matter unsavory Nazi government was, front-line soldiers Waffen-SS (in particular foreign volunteers) gave lives loved ones basic desire free. Historians Nazi Germany vehemently dispute characterization. "These guys don't know history," said Charles W. Sydnor, Jr., retired history professor author "Soldiers Destruction: The SS Death's Head Division, 1933-45," chronicles SS division. "They sanitized, romanticized view occurred." Sydnor added re- enactments like Wiking group's illegal Germany Austria. "If put SS uniform Germany today, you'd arrested." See web-only content: http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/10/why-is-this-gop-house-candidate-dressed-as-a-nazi/64319/ Christopher Browning, professor history University North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said, "It unhistorical apologetic don't know degree they've simply caught innocent war memorabilia enthusiasts love putting uniforms." loft says recall exactly joined Wiking group (his name appears unit roster far back 2003), son "as father-son bonding thing." He says name pictures removed Wiking website concern would harm political career, quit group three years ago, son lost interest. loft participated group name, also alias "Reinhard Pferdmann," also removed, lott described German alter ego. "Part reenactor's [experience]," lott said, "is living-history part, really trying get persona time period. In many, unit, many units individuals create person largely based Germanized version name, history kind based around real experiences. 'Reinhard' course 'Richard' German. And 'Pferdmann,"pferd' horse. So it's literally 'horse man." Asked whether participation Nazi re-enactor's group might upset voters, particularly Jewish voters, loft said hoped would not: "They take context. There's reenactors everything. You couldn't Civil War re-enacting somebody didn't play role Confederates. [This] something that's definitely way past. ... [I hope voters] take context see is, interest World War II history. And that's strictly all." 0 lott Nazi re-enactment. Rabbi Moshe Saks, Congregation B'nai Israel Sylvania, Ohio, suburb Toledo sits 9th district, disagreed. "Any kind reenactment glorification Nazi Germany, us, would something unacceptable certainly poor taste, offensive," said. "I think reaction negative. And among Jewish community, broader community." In follow-up email today, loft seemed pains address concerns conduct may alienated veterans groups made specific mention possible offense Jews human rights groups: "Never, reenacting military history, I meant disrespect anyone served military anyone affected tragedy war. In fact, I immense respect veterans served country valiantly, respect military veterans one reasons I actively studied military history throughout life." He added participated re-enactments Civil War Union infantryman, World War I dough boy World War II American infantryman paratrooper. The actual Wiking unit history grisly Nazi divisions. In book "The Death Marches Hungarian Jews Through Austria Spring 1945," Eleonore Lappin, noted Austrian historian, writes soldiers Wiking division involved killing Hungarian Jews March April 1945, surrendering American forces Austria. "What often hear [Wiking] division never formally accused anything, that's kind dodge," says Prof. Rob Citino, Military History Center University North Texas, examined Wiking website. "The entire German war effort East racial crusade rid world 'subhumans,' Slays going enslaved numbers tens millions. And course multimillion Jewish population Eastern Europe going exterminated altogether. That's folks East. It sends shiver spine think people want dress play SS weekend."

Did Sean. Sid The Political Scene Confounding Fathers The Tea Party's Cold War roots. Sean Wilentz October 18, 2010 ann Beck's view American history stems paranoid politics fifties. A months ago, cable-television radio host Glenn Beck began Fox News show one favorite props: pipe clenched teeth. "I've got pipe," told audience, speech slightly muddled stem, "because we're going speak schoolish kind things." The theme day "Restoring History," Beck, looking professorial neat dark blazer pink button-down shirt, began lesson peering stack history textbooks pronouncing full falsehoods, produced "malicious progressive intent." Progressives, explained—liberals, socialists, Communists, entire spectrum left—"knew separate us history able separate us Constitution God." For next hour, Beck earnestly explained history "is stolen us": depression 1920, example, conservative economics saved nation "near-depression" 1946—crises progressives don't want know about. "You've taught one lie, I think, whole life," said. For fractious Tea Party movement, Beck—a former drive-time radio jockey, recovering alcoholic, Mormon convert—has emerged unifying figure intellectual guide. One opinion poll, released July Democracy Corps, showed "the highly regarded individual among Tea Party supporters," seen merely entertainer, like Rush Limbaugh, "educator." And past months Beck established institute learning: online, for-profit Beck University. Enrollees take courses like Faith 102, contends "revisionists secular progressives" separation church state; Hope 102, attack activist federal government; combined Charity 101/102/103, highly restrictive interpretation rights, federalism, division powers. During "Restoring History" episode, Beck twice encouraged viewers join Web seminars, hear "lessons best brightest historians scholars could find." The B.U. faculty consists three members, including one bona-fide academic, James R. Stoner, Jr., chair political-science department Louisiana State University; two head management consulting firm founder WallBuilders, Web site calls "a national pro-family organization." Beck often acts professor, slightly jocular one, Fox News program. Surrounded charts figures, offers explanations current politics history lessons country's long march Obama-era totalitarianism. The decline, says, began Progressive era early twentieth century, particular Presidency Woodrow Wilson, Federal Reserve System graduated federal income tax came existence. "Wilson," Beck told radio audience August, "just despised America was." Beck's claims found audience among Tea Party spokesmen sympathizers. At movement's Freedom Summit Washington last September, one activist told reporter, "The election Teddy Roosevelt Woodrow Wilson 1912 started going downhill." And April angry member Tea Party Patriots group Cape Fear, North Carolina, claimed group's Web site "the things see happening country today started Wilson Administration." At Tax Day rally past spring, veteran conservative organizer Richard Viguerie described Tea Party "an unfettered new force middle class." And, indeed, calling Obama socialist tradition Woodrow Wilson audacious enough seem like marker new movement—or, least, new twist nation's long history conspiracy-mongering. In fact, marks revival ideas circulated extremist right half century ago, especially John Birch Society among admirers. Beck's version American history relies lessons acknowledged inspiration, late right-wing writer W. Cleon Skousen, also restates charges made Birch Society's founder, Robert Welch. The political universe is, course, different today Cold War. Yet Birchers' politics view American history—which focussed totalitarian threats home posed Soviet Union Communist China—has proved remarkably persistent. The pressing historical question extremist ideas held bay decades inside Republican Party exploded anew—and why, time, Party leaders done virtually nothing challenge ideas, great deal abet them. The early nineteen-sixties turbulent time American politics, right wing particular. In South, racist violence civil-rights workers constant, deepening sectional splits Democratic Party would time deliver solidly Democratic South Republicans. Southern elected officials, support called "massive resistance" civil-rights laws judicial rulings, resurrected ideas nullification interposition, claimed individual states could void federal laws within borders. Others focussed considered fearsome Communist menace inside United States. General Edwin A. Walker caused enormous stir resigned Army 1961, President John F. Kennedy's Pentagon reprimanded spreading right-wing propaganda among troops accusing prominent American officials Communist sympathies. Senator Strom Thurmond, Dixiecrat South Carolina, spoke many far right declared various modestly liberal domestic programs "fall clearly within category socialism." The John Birch Society one decade's controversial right-wing organizations. Founded 1958 Robert Welch, candy manufacturer Massachusetts, society took name Baptist missionary military- intelligence officer killed Communist Chinese forces 1945, Welch called first American casualty Cold War. The group founded propitious time. After Senator Joseph McCarthy's fall, 1954, many McCarthy's followers felt bereft voice, Welch seemed speak them; mid-sixties, society's membership estimated high hundred thousand. Welch, exploiting fears McCarthy called "immense" domestic conspiracy, declared federal government already fallen Communists' clutches. In tract titled "The Politician," attacked President Dwight D. Eisenhower "a dedicated, conscious agent Communist conspiracy" serving plot "all adult life." Late 1961, disastrous Bay Pigs invasion, accused Kennedy Administration "helping Communists everywhere world pretending opposite." Wherever looked, Welch saw Communist forces manipulating American economic foreign policy behalf totalitarianism. But within United States, believed, subversion actually begun years Bolshevik Revolution. Conflating modern liberalism totalitarianism, Welch described government "always inevitably enemy individual freedom." Consequently, charged, Progressive era, expanded federal government's role curbing social economic ills, dire period history, Woodrow Wilson "more one man started nation present road totalitarianism." In nineteen-sixties, Welch became convinced even Communist movement "a tool total conspiracy." This master conspiracy, said, forerunners ancient Sparta, sprang fully life eighteenth century, "uniformly Satanic creed program" Bavarian Illuminati. Run called "the Insiders," conspiracy resided chiefly international families financiers, Rothschilds Rockefellers, government agencies like Federal Reserve System Internal Revenue Service, nongovernmental organizations like Bilderberg Group, Council Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission. Since early twentieth century, done good deal evil work guise humanitarian uplift. "One broad avenue conspiratorial forces advance known progressive legislation," Welch declared 1966. "The collectivist theories demagogic pretenses destroyed earlier civilizations paraded forth disguise new modern concepts." In worst case, Welch believed, military action might necessary dislodge totalitarians. But moment nonviolent political revolution would suffice. Accordingly, designed Birch Society roughly, explicitly, Marxist-Leninist model vanguard revolutionary party: series small cells would work secret agitate populace elect right-thinking candidates office. "It isn't numbers worry about," Welch wrote, "but courage part followers stick necks play rough—the Communists do." The "Founder" would dictate society's policies, advised council two dozen businessmen professionals, local cells would overseen unyielding commanders. "It leadership demanding, exacting followers," Welch observed, "that achieves really dedicated support." Welch's group became synonymous right-wing extremism, earning satirical blasts critics ranging cartoonist Walt Kelly musicians Bob Dylan Dizzy Gillespie. The trumpeter, whose actual name John Birks Gillespie, made humorous run Presidency 1964, organizing John Birks Societies twenty-five states. Still, outlandish era's right-wing anti-Communists Welch Willard Cleon Skousen. A transplanted Canadian served Mormon missionary teens, Skousen considered radical early nineteen-sixties even J. Edgar Hoover's F.B.I. watched closely; one 1962 memo extensive F.B.I. file noted "during past year so, Skousen affiliated extreme right-wing 'professional communists' promoting anticommunism obvious financial purposes." Skousen employed F.B.I., 1935 1951, much time special agent working chiefly administration. These desk jobs, claimed implausibly, gave access confidential domestic intelligence Communism. Skousen also maintained served Hoover's administrative assistant; Hoover informed inquirers position. Skousen taught years speech religion departments Brigham Young University, interrupted stint, 1956 1960, police chief Salt Lake City. His time office contentious, raided friendly card game attended city's right-wing mayor, J. Bracken Lee, promptly fired. Lee called Skousen "a master half truths" said ran police department "like Gestapo"; Skousen's supporters placed burning crosses Mayor's lawn. After losing police job, Skousen founded group called All-American Society, Time described 1961 exemplar far-right "ultras." Although join Birch Society, Skousen worked American Opinion Speakers' Bureau, and, 1963, wrote rousing tract titled "The Communist Attack John Birch Society," condemned society's critics "promoting official Communist Party line." (This tic Skousen's; later defended Mormon policy denying priesthood blacks pamphlet called "The Communist Attack Mormons.") All along, Skousen's evolving thoughts ran tandem Welch's. In "The Naked Communist," lengthy primer published 1958, enlivened survey worldwide leftist threat outlandish claims, writing F.D.R.'s adviser Harry Hopkins treasonously delivered Soviets large supply uranium, Russians built first Sputnik plans stolen United States. A year Richard Condon's novel "The Manchurian Candidate" appeared, Skousen announced Communists creating "a regimented breed Pavlovian men whose minds could triggered immediate action signals masters." A later book, "The Naked Capitalist," decried Ivy League Establishment, who, Federal Reserve, Council Foreign Relations, Rockefeller Foundation, formed "the world's secret power structure." The conspiracy begun, Skousen wrote, reformers like wealthy banker Edward M. (Colonel) House, close adviser President Woodrow Wilson, helped put place Federal Reserve graduated income tax. In 1971, Skousen organized another group, Freemen Institute, later renamed National Center Constitutional Studies. According article published Review Religious Research, center's targets included "the Occupational Safety Health Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Communication Commission's fairness doctrine editorial broadcasting, federal government's change gold standard currency, subsidies farmers, federal aid education, federal social welfare, foreign aid, social security, elimination public school prayer Bible reading, (that familiar right-wing nemesis) United Nations." Skousen's pronouncements made pariah among conservative activists, including right-wing fringe. In 1962, ultraconservative American Security Council threw out, members felt "gone deep end." In 1971, review Mormon journal Dialogue accused Skousen "inventing fantastic ideas making inferences go far beyond bounds honest commentary," advancing doctrines came "perilously close" Nazism. And 1979, Skousen called President.Jimmy Carter puppet Council Foreign Relations Rockefeller family, president Mormon church issued national order banning announcements organizations. Skousen undeterred. In 1981, produced "The 5,000 Year Leap," treatise assembles selective quotations groundless assertions claim U.S. Constitution rooted Enlightenment Bible, framers believed minimal central government. Either proposition would astounded James Madison, often described guiding spirit behind Constitution, rejected state-established religions and, like Alexander Hamilton, proposed central government strong could veto state laws. "The 5,000 Year Leap" fervid book. Instead, calmly, ingratiatingly misleading. Skousen quotes various eighteenth-century patriots evils Samuel Adams, 1768, called "the Utopian schemes leveling," Skousen equates redistribution wealth. But mention Founders' endorsement taxing rich support general welfare. Thomas Jefferson, example, wrote approvingly 1811 federal taxes (then limited tariffs) fall solely wealthy, meant "the farmer see government supported, children educated, face country made paradise contributions rich alone, without called spend cent earnings." Skousen also challenges separation church state, asserting "the Founders indulging idle gesture adopted motto 'In God We Trust.' "In reality, motto came Constitutional Convention "E Pluribus Unum": many, one. "In God We Trust" came much later; use coins first permitted 1864, 1955, height Cold War, Congress mandate appear currency. The following year, President Eisenhower—who Welch charged Communist agent—approved "In God We Trust" national motto. In 1982, Skousen published follow-up work, ancestor-worshipping history text titled The Making America," prepared study guide nationwide seminars based contents. As Alexander Zaitchik reports informative study Beck, "Common Nonsense," new book became object controversy 1987, California Bicentennial Commission sold part fund-raising drive. Among offenses account slavery drawn long-disgraced work historian Fred A. Shannon, characterized slave children "pickaninnies" suggested worst victims slavery slaveholders themselves. The constitutional scholar Jack Rakove, Stanford, inspected Skousen's book seminars pronounced "a joke self-respecting scholar would think worth warm pitcher spit." By time Skousen died, 2006, little remembered outside ranks furthest-right Mormons. Then, 2009, Glenn Beck began touting work: "The Naked Communist," "The Naked Capitalist," and, especially, "The 5,000 Year Leap," called "essential understanding Founders built Republic way did." After Beck put book first spot required-reading list—and wrote enthusiastic new introduction reissue— shot top Amazon best-seller list. In first half 2009, sold two hundred fifty thousand copies. Local branches Tea Party Patriots, United American Tea Party, groups across country since organized study groups around it. "It time learn follow FREEDOM principles Founding Fathers," United American Tea Party video declares, referring principles expounded Skousen's book. If Beck movement's teacher, "The 5,000 Year Leap" become primer, "The Making America" kind 102- level text. The popularity Beck's broadcasts, reach two million viewers day, brought neo-Birchite ideas audience beyond Welch Skousen might dreamed of. Several times week, Beck informs audience socialists (whom also sometimes calls Fascists Communists) led Obama seized power, patriotic Americans must take country back. His TV show time featured "Comrade Updates," Beck described perfidy Soviet anthem played background. He attacks familiar bogeymen: Federal Reserve System (which asserts private conglomerate, unaccountable public); Council Foreign Relations (born "progressive idea" manipulate media order "let masses know done"); historical procession evildoers, including Skousen's old target Colonel House Welch's old target Woodrow Wilson. His sources matters, quite apart Skousen's books, unreliable. On September 22nd, amid diatribe House, Beck cited passage "Secrets Federal Reserve," Eustace Mullins. The book, commissioned 1948 Ezra Pound, startlingly anti-Semitic fantasy Jewish-led conspiracy all-powerful bankers established Federal Reserve service plot dominate world. Part Beck's allure promise reveal secret information. In one segment last year, produced drawing fasces—which described, anachronistically, "the Roman symbol Fascism"—and picture old Mercury dime, fasces reverse side. "Who brought dime in? It happened 1916—Woodrow Wilson President," said. "We've road Fascism while." Benito Mussolini, course, didn't adopt ancient symbol authority Fascist emblem nineteen-twenties; designer coin, sculptor Adolph A. Weinman, intended signify nation's military preparedness, paired olive branch illustrate desire peace. Beck's readings Progressive-era politics nearly bizarre. Whatever said Theodore Roosevelt, crypto-radical. It Roosevelt coined term "lunatic fringe" describe extreme leftists day, concept New Nationalism—in activist government built vibrant capitalism, partly regulating big business—looked back Alexander Hamilton, Karl Marx. Nor Wilson Bolshevik; fact, 1917 sent American troops Russia support anti-Bolshevik White Army. At home, reforms sought break monopolies order restore competition among small companies. "If America free enterprise," Wilson declared, "then freedom sort whatever." In 2007, Beck, host "Glenn Beck," CNN's Headline News, brought show John Birch Society spokesman named Sam Antonio, warned government plot abolish U.S. borders Mexico Canada, "and eventually throughout Americas." Beck told Antonio, "When I growing up, John Birch Society—I thought bunch nuts." But now, said, "you guys starting make sense me." His guest beamed. "Yes, John Birch Society nuts," Antonio said. "We exposing truth that's many, many years." Since then, Birch Society's Web site run clips Beck's Fox broadcasts, proudly pointing similarities ideas. Last June, essay site described presentation Beck Communism America "the ultimate complete agreement Beck JBS presentations American history." Beck also praised Ezra Taft Benson, one Skousen's close associates. Benson, Secretary Agriculture President Eisenhower thirteenth president Church Jesus Christ Latter-Day Saints, gained notoriety speech 1966 denounced Democratic officeholders intellectuals (including historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.) socialists Communist sympathizers, warned "the Constitution endangered hang, were, single thread," praised John Birch Society "the effective non-church organization fight creeping socialism Godless Communism." Last June, Beck aired clip another Benson speech, intoning, "Ezra Taft Benson warned coming." The Birch Society's Web site subsequently praised Beck "getting progressively (sorry bad word choice) closer presenting American history way The John Birch Society 50 years." Beck sole representative today's multifaceted Tea Party Welch Skousen nineteen- sixties far right; recently told Times, bit disingenuously, "not involved Tea Party." Why, then, politics Skousen, Benson, John Birch Society resurgence among conservative Republicans—not Beck Tea Party heroes like Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron Angle? (Last month, Angle gave warm address "freedom conference" Salt Lake City, co-sponsored John Birch Society Skousen's old group, National Center Constitutional Studies, praising audience "mainstream America" patriots "heard call.") The columnist Frank Rich, among others, suggested election black President sowed "fears disenfranchisement among dwindling threatened minority country." There signs so: Republicans' singling Thurgood Marshall "activist Justice" Elena Kagan's Supreme Court confirmation hearings, warnings Fox News terrible dangers posed minuscule New Black Panther Party. But "socialist" racial slur. Jim Crow built fears Federal Reserve I.R.S. The Tea Party's fulminations cap-and-trade, federal-government bailouts, big government generally play old themes nothing color President Obama's skin. The current right-wing resurgence inner dynamics American conservatism past half century. In nineteen-fifties nineteen-sixties, far right condemned liberals, might expected; November, 1961, President Kennedy devoted part speech Los Angeles denouncing "discordant voices extremism" "equate Democratic Party welfare state, welfare state socialism, socialism Communism." But Bircher right also provoked deep anxiety among conservatives, feared perceived paranoids conspiracy-mongers. The leading intellectual spokesman organizer anti-Bircher conservatives William F. Buckley, Jr., editor National Review. Buckley means moderate conservatism. He lifelong defender Joseph McCarthy foe New Deal liberalism. But drew line claiming course American government set socialist conspiracy, feared ravings extreme right would cost balanced, practical conservatives chance national power. "By 1961," biographer John B. Judis writes, "Buckley beginning worry John Birch Society growing rapidly, right-wing upsurge country would take ugly, even Fascist turn rather leading toward kind conservatism National Review promoted." In next two decades, Buckley's support counsel, Richard Nixon Ronald Reagan completed conservative revolution succeeded keeping extremist elements far centers power. As confidant adviser leading conservative politicians, Buckley far political influence might expected editor weekly journal. Yet early nineteen-sixties found fighting Birchers fellow-travellers extremely difficult. Even though Buckley's colleagues National Review thought Birch Society went far, would attack society publicly, fear alienating Birchers conservatives sympathized views. When Buckley wrote editorial 1962 accused Welch "distorting reality" failing make "the crucial moral political distinction" Communists liberals, magazine immediately lost subscriptions financial support. By 1960, Senator Barry Goldwater, Arizona, emerging great political hope conservative Republicans, consulted closely Buckley. At meeting Breakers hotel, Palm Beach, January, 1962, Buckley urged Goldwater repudiate Birch Society. Goldwater demurred; though conceded embarrassing "kooks" lurked among Birchers, insisted Buckley also "nice guys," would injudicious attack group public. The Birchers' support helped gain Goldwater Republican Presidential nomination 1964, winked acceptance speech famous line: "Extremism defense liberty vice. . . . Moderation pursuit justice virtue." In general election, though, Goldwater suffered crushing loss Lyndon Johnson, partly Democrats succeeded making look like captive loony right. (To Goldwater slogan "In Your Heart, You Know He's Right," Democrats shot back, "In Your Guts, You Know He's Nuts.") Buckley's fears confirmed. But undeterred efforts build respectable viable conservative movement. In 1967, favored Richard Nixon among field Republican aspirants. He liked Ronald Reagan's politics, considered Reagan, recently elected governor California, new national politics. George Romney, governor Michigan, wishy- washy moderate, obviously unsuitable, say nothing Republican archliberal Nelson Rockefeller, New York. Nixon hard-nosed Republican strong conservative views, especially Communism Cold War; established Communist-hunter nineteen-forties pressing charge Alger Hiss, former official State Department, spied Soviets. And, promisingly, Nixon front-runner. "It seems ought real chance winning year," Buckley wrote Goldwater around time Republican National Convention. He served campaign adviser, aiding friend Frank Shakespeare, taken charge Nixon's media operations. But Buckley's candidate reputation shiftiness made unpopular across political spectrum. Some editors National Review, recalling Nixon cut deal Rockefeller order secure G.O.P. nomination 1960, didn't sufficiently trust him. And Birch Society nothing contempt figure Welch called one "the slipperiest politicians ever showed American scene." As President, 1969, Nixon began open diplomatic relations Communist China, right wing placed list perfidious appeasers. When visited Beijing 1972, even Buckley deeply offended. But general election took place later year, antiwar Democratic candidate, George McGovern, voicing country's anxieties Vietnam, Buckley mainstream called "responsible conservatism" returned Nixon. The purist conservatives left back third-party candidacy John Schmitz, Republican congressman member John Birch Society. Nixon won landslide, next year appointed Buckley American delegate United Nations. The conservative pragmatists found way real power. And, despite embarrassment Watergate, Nixon's second term, strategy proved effective time. Nixon's campaign McGovern sharpened Democrats' internal divisions civil rights Vietnam, and, Buckley wrote, revealed Democrats "an indifference toward national independence hostility toward national freedom." Meanwhile, Buckley mainstream, read Birchers conservative movement, established permanent growing force Republican Party national politics. In 1976, Buckley National Review supported Ronald Reagan's primary challenge Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford. After two terms governor, Reagan matured Buckley considered nearly ideal conservative politician: shrewd leader well man principle. Reagan nearly succeeded wresting nomination Ford, demonstrating formidable national figure become. The Bircher right flourished political bastion Orange County, Reagan adept winning extremists' allegiance pursued realistic strategies. His pragmatic side showed immediately finally secured Republican nomination 1980, chose relatively moderate George H. W. Bush, bitter foe primaries, running mate. Though decision dismayed right-wing ideologues, two practical benefits: instantly healed divisions Republican moderates conservatives, helped dampen charges Democrats Reagan reckless right- winger. Nobody pleased Bush's selection fellow Skull Bones man William F. Buckley, understood political logic clearly Reagan had. As President, Reagan flattered extremists—he even delivered admiring words Skousen's Freemen Institute—but saved political capital real goals: undoing fiscal underpinnings New Deal-style government, redirecting U.S. foreign policy battling Soviet Union proxies around world. He appointed moderates positions importance, made James Baker III, Bush's close associate, first chief staff, rather far ideological Edwin Meese III, former chief staff California. (As top policy adviser, Meese helped Reagan stack federal bench conservatives, otherwise eclipsed Baker Baker's deputy, pragmatic Reaganite Michael Deaver, crusade, Attorney General, roll back civil-rights legislation largely failed.) When zealots Administration exposed, Iran-Contra scandal, Reagan skillfully evaded responsibility replaced centrist Republicans. And, recognized Mikhail Gorbachev Soviet leader could undertake genuine efforts reduce nuclear threat, Reagan pushed forward, ignoring complaints become, hard-liner Howard Phillips's phrase, "a useful idiot Soviet propaganda." Whatever misgivings may arisen right, Reagan achieved dramatic conservative overhaul federal tax code, profound reconfiguring judiciary, near-victory West Cold War. From standpoint mainstream right, problem legacy Republican could come close matching public appeal political savvy. For party Reagan, departure beginning long decline, absence similarly totemic figure, past twenty years, allowed current resurgence extremism. George H. W. Bush repelled right-wingers moderate tendencies—not least when, face fiscal calamity, broke campaign pledge raise taxes. Bill Clinton inspired almost ecstatic series attacks, though remained enough older conservative establishment, personified Senator Bob Dole, check wildest charges, new Republican House majority 1994, pushed ideologues Tom DeLay Dick Armey, little interest maintaining center. They harassed Clinton, forcing impeachment even though polls showed sixty per cent American people disapproved. George W. Bush seemed first bit Reagan's conservative charisma, right wing turned failing win war Iraq, moderate position immigration, spending hundreds millions federal dollars combat financial collapse 2008. When William F. Buckley died, 2008 primary season, seemed symbolize end conservative era. David Klinghoffer, former literary editor National Review, lamented "urbane visionaries builders institutions" Buckley replaced media figures "who make money stirring fears resentments." Conservatism, Klinghoffer added, "has undergone shift toward demagoguery hucksterism," ruled called "the crazy-cons." Some Republicans tried extend Buckley tradition, little effect. The commentator David Frum, former speechwriter George W. Bush, lost job American Enterprise Institute complained Republicans' obstruction health-care reform called right-wing surge threat conservatism. In June, congressman Bob Inglis, South Carolina, tough conservative nonetheless backed Bush's financial bailout, lost vicious primary fight right-wing insurgent named Trey Gowdy. To amazement, Inglis confronted campaign trail voters convinced numbers Social Security cards indicated secret bank bought birth. "And then, course," recalls, "it turned something Federal Reserve Bilderbergers stuff." Not even Karl Rove afford open dissent Tea Partiers. Appearing Fox News night recent primaries, described Tea Party-backed Senate candidate Delaware, Christine O'Donnell, probably unelectable said statements "nutty." Instantly, criticism came Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh, right-wing Republicans. Within days, back Fox, proclaiming "a huge Tea Party fan," endorsing O'Donnell, affirming National Republican Senatorial Committee would give full backing. So far, Rove, unlikely dissident, prominent Republican leader much gesture stepping forward, Buckley allies did. Even strong conservatives like Inglis pushed aside, former G.O.P. stalwarts Charlie Crist, Florida, Mike Castle, Delaware, beaten primaries Tea Party candidates; Grist running long-shot campaign Independent. Desperate gains midterm elections, Republicans neglecting struggle took make politics safe Reagan. Fifty years ago, President Kennedy deplored far right's "counsels fear suspicion." Today, Obama's White House still struggling make sense enemies. In absence forthright leadership, right left, job standing extremists appears left electorate. Candidates like O'Donnell may prove eccentric prevail, voters may simply become disillusioned politicians campaign hatred government. After election, mainstream conservatives may well engage Richard Viguerie forecast "a massive, almost historic battle heart soul Republican Party." (Already, Rove leading Bush political operatives, including former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie, quietly supplanting battered G.O.P. establishment effort raise funds year's candidates.) But, according recent poll, seventy per cent Republicans support Tea Party, seems almost certain Republican Party unstintingly appeased far right enjoy strong perhaps smashing victory coming midterm elections. In 1906, early Progressive era, humorist Finley Peter Dunne's fictional barroom sage, Mr. Dooley, put social political tumult day perspective. "Th' noise ye hear th' first gun iv revolution," Dooley remarked. "It's on'y th' people iv th' United States batin' carpet." A century now, even year now, Americans may say Tea Party. For moment, though, appears extreme right wing verge securing degree power Congress Republican Party unprecedented modern American history. For defenders national cohesion tempered adversity politics, alarming state affairs. • Read http://www.newyorker.com/reportinq/2010/10/18/101018fa fact wilentz?printable=true#ixzz123hWc5bz
This distilled, pure utterly conventional wisdom much DC political chattering class moment. The first two paragraphs important, completely accurate assessment, rest twaddle: 1:1 Monday, Oct. 11,2010 Why Obama Is Losing Political War By Mark Halperin Barack Obama politically crushed vise. From above, elite opinion competence. From below, mass anger anxiety unemployment. And late anything predicament November's elections. With exception core Obama Administration loyalists, politically engaged elites reached conclusions: White House head, isolated, insular, arrogant clueless get along persuade members Congress, media, business community working-class voters. This view held Fox News pundits, executives anchors major old-media outlets, reporters cover White House, Democratic Republican congressional leaders governors, many Democratic business people lawyers raised big money Obama 2008, even members Administration beyond inner circle. (See Obama's troubled first year, issue issue.) On Friday, release latest bleak unemployment data — last major jobs figures midterms — Obama said, "Putting American people back work, expanding opportunity, rebuilding economic security middle class moral national challenge time." But elites feel President failed meet challenge convinced unable remainder term. Moreover, growing perception Obama's decisions causing harm — businesses hurt Administration's legislation economic recovery stalling uncertainty surrounding energy policy, health care, deficits, housing, immigration spending. And sentiment spreading. Many members general public appear deeply skeptical Obama's capacity turn things around, especially, exclusively, inclined dislike — Tea Partyers John McCain voters, also tens millions middle-class Americans, including quite turned Obama 2008. (See Americans facing prospect long-term unemployment.) The misery afflicting country political affiliation. Listen voices striking TV ad Rob Portman, Republican former Congressman Bush budget director running Senate Ohio. One woman Dayton career fair says starkly, "There jobs." A man announces plaintively obvious frustration, "I've looking job 13 months." Events like job fair becoming grim iconic gatherings time, breadlines Obama years. Most Obama's private (and sometimes public) rebuttals voices slamming sides justified spot on. He inherit lot problems Bush Administration. He act quickly initial weeks Administration stave worldwide depression. His efforts job creation obstructed Republicans (even proposals based policies supported GOP past). His opponents haven't put forth specifics own, offered genuine compromise, media allowed right's activists gabbers run wild criticism without furnishing legitimate alternative solutions. (See Barack Obama's top 10 sound bites.) But Obama exacerbated political problems failing enact policies would actually turned economy around, also authorizing series tactical moves intended demonize Republicans distract problems hand. He wasted time lambasting foes putting forth agenda clear, optimistic fashion, defending benefits key decisions past two years (health care Troubled Asset Relief Program, example) explaining would re-elected Democratic majority spur growth. Throughout year, treated Obama-led attacks George W. Bush Dick Cheney, Rush Limbaugh, Congressman Joe Barton (for odd apology BP), John Boehner (for seeking speakership — something ant?) Fox News (for everything). Suitable Democratic targets cases, perhaps, worth time busy Commander Chief. In past days, witnessed spectacle President top advisers wading allegations Republicans attempting buy election using foreign money laundered Chamber Commerce, combining Karl Rove wealthy backers fund flood negative television commercials. Not issue convoluted far-fetched, also distracts issues voters care about, frustrating political insiders alienating struggling citizens (not many following offbeat story line). Feinting gibing can't obscure job numbers. (See best viral campaign ads 2010.) The President Democrats passed many significant measures (the stimulus spending, auto-company rescue, health care law financial regulation effort) someday may seen brave bold, foundation better economy. Obama closest aides certainly think happen. But President correct said Friday, "the piece economic news folks still looking work want hear is, 'You're hired," that's still occurring many Americans. The politically good news Obama matter outcome midterm elections, everything changes January. Republicans greater obligation, politically morally, help govern, rather thwart badger. The President get chance, State Union address budget proposal, show turning page political horrors 2010 party nation. But then, Republicans almost certainly going demonstrate beat something nothing, especially Americans seem think Obama Administration hasn't much offer either, except isn't working. • Find article at: • http://www.time.com/time/golitics/article/0,8599,2024718,00.html Copyright © 2010 Time Inc.

ROTHKOPF I OCTOBER 8, 2010 The president's inexperience Jones general's deficits. He didn't know wanted. He vacillated key issues. He simply demonstrated problems America repeatedly hires men foreign- policy background take important international job world. Further, really know enough presidency works nip bud creation inner-circle bubble effectively negated much work formal policy process did.

The Huffington Post October 12, 2010 oward Fineman finemanAhuffingtonpost.com I HuffPost Reporting The Power Of Clinton, The Invisibility Of Obama First Posted: 10-12-10 02:37 PM I Updated: 10-12-10 02:37 PM LOUISVILLE -- I see Dr. Rand Paul taken Bill Clinton, dredging Monica Lewinsky. And I know Paul so. The former president Kentucky yesterday state, many others, far potent popular foe President Barack Obama. On first day working The Huffington Post, I came back Kentucky, I began career many years ago Courier-Journal. The people run University Louisville Kentucky Author Forum wanted on-stage interview certain best-selling author also new boss: Arianna Huffington. It tricky mix professional incest personal nostalgia, event worked well I also got chance play Kentucky reporter state. I raced Lexington ground-level, outside-the-Beltway reality I witnessed: Like Voldemort's, Obama's name one dares utter -- includes Clinton speaking Democrats. At sunny, noontime rally campus University Kentucky Lexington yesterday, former president made stirring, well-argued case Democratic Senate candidate Jack Conway Democrats generally -- without mentioning Obama rarely mentioning presidency. It though suddenly two branches government. To fair, almost one else one-hour rally mentioned sitting president. And Kentucky staunch Republican territory. "We're farther ahead generic ballot ever," GOP Senator Mitch McConnell Kentucky told yesterday. "President Obama never popular here, even peak." Still, eerie invisibility president telling commentary Democrats' confused, divided defensive predicament brace verdict voters Election Day, Nov. 2. There something odd -- and, you're Democrat, depressing -- former Democratic president avoiding mention Democratic successor. Clinton sincerely wants help trail -- certainly wants avoid accusation didn't try help. But travels turned personal victory lap often makes -- candidate he's touting -- center attention. That true Kentucky. The rally's mechanics mostly handled Secret Service; point, final (and therefore top-billed) speaker wasn't Conway. It Clinton. The Conway people didn't mind. They glad him. Rail-thin frail, wearing tweedy professorial sports coat signature rueful, knowing smile, Clinton treated respect bordering awe. His familiar mane white hair, thinning now, translucent sun, giving almost otherworldly look: Sage Better Age. Clinton beloved In Kentucky. He won state twice. He speaks local dialect, contains Appalachian notes working-class pride, suspicion big shots Baptist revivalism. But -- Kentucky -- Clinton's economic record (22.7 million jobs created, tends forget mention .7) looks spectacularly good context followed. These days almost Old Testament, milk-and-honey reverence economic record, least expressed former Kentucky Sen. Wendell Ford. An old-school podium pounder, Ford -- stooped still strong voiced 86 -- talked former president messianic terms. "Bill Clinton found us path gold!" shouted. The crowd 2,000, students, didn't laugh. They seemed think right. How helps Obama far clear; isn't even clear helps many Democrats -- since they'd joining Washington party current president ostensibly heads. But Clinton happy show Obama it's done. As campaigner president, Clinton's gift ability untangle knots even complex policy issue explain plain language people suspicious powerful -- eager screwed seen dupes. Republicans corporate allies shut good things government you, said, name balancing budget destroyed. "I gave budget surpluses!" Clinton said, act personal beneficence. Knowing audience, former president focused Pell Grants, new program allows graduates pay back loans longer periods lower rates. Paul, said, try take new program away -- and, given GOP's deliberate vagueness spending cuts -- reason think Clinton right. Which Paul got personal today. Which means Clinton drew blood. Which means came do. Which means Obama remain invisible, least Kentucky, least now, probably long time come. Ci

Mills, Cheryl D <MillsCD@state.gov> Tuesday, November 9, 2010 9:42 AM Mills, Cheryl D FW: Issa plans hundreds hearings FYI
I know I'm supposed lift head QDDR, thought would like see — it's ideas wanted promoted picked me. AM The Crossroads Nation By DAVID BROOKS Bill Clinton used talk building bridge 21st century. President Obama talks laying "new foundation." But Clinton always vague land side bridge going look like, Obama vague edifice going go top foundation. They vague nobody clear sort country America going 2030 2050. Nobody quite defined America's coming economic identity. In thinking question, probably helps start beginning. Five hundred years ago, agriculture major economic activity. One hundred years ago, industrial production. Now, course, we're living information age. Innovation creativity engines economic growth. Howard Gardner Harvard put together composite picture extraordinarily creative person: She comes little place somewhat removed center power influence. As adolescent, feels outgrowing small circle. She moves metropolis finds group people share passions interests. She gets involved team create something amazing. Then, point, finds problem, related yet different problems concern others group. She breaks struggles finally emerges new thing. She brings back circle. It tested, refined improved. The main point composite story creativity solitary process. It happens within networks. It happens talented people get together, idea systems mentalities merge. Now imagine creative person year 2010, 2025 2050. You living small town Ukraine Kenya place, foreign domestic. You long break go place people gathering think things thinking about, creating things want create. If passionate fashion, maybe go Paris. If it's engineering, maybe it'll Germany. But passionate many spheres, I suspect you'll want America. You'll want U.S. English become global language. You'll want come American universities lead world research draw many best minds corners earth. You'll want American institutions relatively free corruption. Intellectual property protected. Huge venture capital funds already exist. Moreover, United States universal nation. There already people connections world. A nation immigrants permeable say, Chinese society. You also observe America hosts right kind networks — ones flexible intense. Study study suggests America one societies high social trust. Americans build large, efficient organizations bound circles kinship clan. Study study finds Americans hierarchical. American children raised challenge parents. American underlings relatively free challenge bosses. In country you're less likely submit authority. From story see economic power 21st century going look like economic power 20th century. The crucial fact new epoch creativity needs hubs. Information networks need junction points. The nation make crossroads world tremendous economic political power. In 2009, Anne-Marie Slaughter, director policy planning State Department, wrote essay Foreign Affairs laid logic new situation: "In networked world, issue longer relative power, centrality increasingly dense global web." Slaughter's essay titled "America's Edge." That apt. Americans depressed state mind. As China India rise, nearly two-thirds Americans believe nation decline. In fact, U.S. well situated crossroads nation. It well situated center global networks nurture right kinds networks. Building America means everything possible thicken connections: finance research attract scientists; improve infrastructure ease travel; fix immigration funnel talent; reform taxes attract superstars; make study abroad rite passage college students; take advantage millions veterans served overseas. The nation thickest expansive networks define age. There's reason pessimistic that.
Love it.

His website Subjects: • Democracy government • International politics • United States • democracy & power • american power & world • rise new right The rise Tea Party movement United States first twenty months Barack Obama '5 presidency shaking political establishment, trend reinforced victories candidates Republican Party primaries. But movement come from, inner life? Max Blumenthal begin_of the_skype highlighting end the_skype highlighting, author "Republican Gomorrah", enters heady world Tea Party unravel mix driven personalities, feverish rhetoric, toxic hatreds, flirtation violence fuel sub-culture's insurgent activism. "He tell wants strong authority take crushing responsibility thinking himself. Since Republic weak, led break law love obedience. But really strong authority wishes? In reality demands rigorous order others, disorder without responsibility" - Jean-Paul Sartre, Anti- Semite Jew I sure I first detected noxious fumes would envelop conservative movement Barack Obama era. It might April 2009, I visited series gun shows rural California Nevada. Perusing tables piled high high-calibre semi-automatic weapons chatting anyone vicinity, I heard urgent warnings mass roundups, concentration-camps, socialist government Washington. "These people purchasing guns people worried what's going country", gun dealer told outside show Reno. "Good luck Obama", young gun enthusiast remarked me. "We outnumber 100 1." At time, Tea Party movement even registered national media's radar. In September 2009, I led panel discussion University California-Riverside book Republic Gomorrah (Basic/Nation Books, 2009). Inside auditorium filled nearly 100 students faculty, I sat alongside Jonathan Walton, African-American professor religious studies prolific writer, Mark Takano, erudite, openly gay former Democratic congressional candidate local community-college trustee. In middle discussion, dozen college Republicans stormed front stage signs denouncing "left-wing hack" hysterical young man leaped crowd, blowing kisses mockingly Takano heckling Walton "racist". Afterward, university police-officers insisted escorting ride right-wing heckler attempted follow shouted threats. Who stalker? Just concerned citizen worried taxes? His name Ryan Sorba operative heavily funded national conservative youth outfit, Intercollegiate Studies Institute. Besides founding dozens Republican youth groups across country, Sorba devoted exceptional amount energy interest homosexuals. His intellectual output consists tract titled The Born Gay Hoax, arguing homosexuality curable disease bogus trend manufactured academic leftists. Adding credentials, Sorba history run-ins law, explained I called order. My encounter aggressive right-wing cadre seemed strange, isolated event. But hostility turned symptomatic intensifying campaign delegitimise President Obama allies Congress. The right's days rage beginning. The constellation Through first year office, Obama seemed oblivious threat far right. He campaigned partisanship, declaring "no red states" "conservative America". Apparently, thought merely contrivance myth people rejected science, demonised gays, assailed minority women's rights - genuinely believed said. Speaking changing Washington, Obama seemed think entire history politics since rise Ronald Reagan right strategies polarisation deeply rooted superficial problem attributable certain "divisive" personalities, easily wiped away gestures toward bipartisanship. His view parties simply mirror images sharing fundamental beliefs separated "partisans". The skilled devoted community organiser could bring together. Many supporters media, often partisans political wars years, reinforced amplified innocence, proclaiming one last could "bridge partisan divide". Andrew Sullivan, disaffected conservative called critics George W Bush policies "fifth columnists" fervently supported Obama, wrote new president destined become "a liberal Reagan reunite America". This optimism pervaded White House new president aides sought Republicans willing vote programmes. After all, couldn't get along? In autobiographical book The Audacity Hope, Obama highlighted key component political strategy: "I serve blank screen people vastly different political stripes project views." Once elected, conservatives concluded could reverse Obama's strength transforming human tableau fearsome images could conjure (see "Barack Obama, fallen messiah", 23 December 2009). Obama's multiracial background crucial cultivating resentment among shock-troops. Those rejected Obama's legitimacy serve president basis background gave birth "Birther" movement sought challenge citizenship. The movement's visible figure, therefore eccentric, Orly Taitz, dentist self-trained lawyer immigrated former Soviet republican Moldova Israel settling conservative bastion Orange County, California. Convinced claims far-right website WorldNetDaily Obama planned create "civilian national security force", Taitz told "realised Obama another Stalin - it's cross Stalinist USSR Hitler's Germany." After becoming transfixed online conspiracy theories claiming Obama's family forged birth-certificate Hawaii, Taitz snapped action. She filed lawsuit November 2008 California's secretary state Debra Bowen demanding investigation Obama's eligibility serve president. Taitz's plaintiff case Wiley Drake, Orange County radio-preacher former second vice-president Southern Baptist Convention publicly prayed Obama's death. While lawsuit went nowhere, subsequent suits earned angry rebukes judges, Taitz became instant media sensation, delivering heavily accented screeds Obama friendly interviewers Sean Hannity CNN's Lou Dobbs (the latter, described Taitz "greatest supporter", eventually fired indirect result hosting her). In March 2009, Texas Representative Randy Neugebauer signed Birther bill proposing future presidential candidates must prove citizenship becoming eligible campaign. The Birther movement found voice government made indelible impact Republican grassroots. By June 2009, 28% Republican respondents Kos/Research 2000 poll said thought Obama wasn't born United States, 30% "weren't sure". "Obama Big House", Taitz shrieked me, "not White House!" When Obama announced healthcare reform first major initiative administration, conservative movement activated campaign demonisation - transformational politics - designed turn Obama "Other", making seem unfamiliar, therefore threatening, possible. When president urged Congress deliver healthcare-reform bill 2009, right staged living theatre political hatred turned Obama's dream bipartisanship nightmarish version Peter Weiss's MaraVSade. On 12 September 2009, tens thousands far- right activists belonging loose confederation anti-government groups called Tea Party Patriots converged Washington's National Mall giant protest Obama healthcare plan. The date significant: Fox News's top-ranked talk-show host Glenn Beck declared birth "9-12 Project" restore sense unity (and siege mentality) Americans experienced 11 September 2001. But time, Obama - Osama - enemy. While covering rally, I witnessed sign sign declaring Obama greater danger America's security al-Qaida; demonstrators held images juxtaposed Obama's face images evildoers Hitler Pol Pot Bin Laden; others carried signs questioning Obama's status United States citizen. "We fight al-Qaida, can't kill Obama", said aging demonstrator. Another told me, "Obama biggest Nazi world", pointing placards fashioned depicting Obama House Representatives' majority leader Nancy Pelosi SS outfits. According another activist, Obama's agenda similar Hitler's: "Hitler took banking industry, not? And Hitler personal secret service police. [The community-organising group] Acorn extension that." The seemingly incongruous Tea Party propaganda recalled signs waved right-wing Jewish settlers rallies Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin support peace process, portraying SS officer French collaborator Marshall Petain. In 1995, amid provocative atmosphere, young right-wing Jewish zealot assassinated Rabin. The Israeli tragedy cautionary example targeted hatred leading violence. Members Tea Party "Patriots" seem care rhetoric irrational, comparing Obama Hitler Stalin contradictory obviously hyperbolic. Their motives entirely negative. By purging government multicultural evil seized power illicit means (several activists told believed Acorn helped Obama steal election), convinced mythical golden American yesteryear would return. They interest building anything new even articulating agenda, much less discussing merits policies. The Tea Party's primary concern cultural purification - freedom from, freedom to. Against dark image president liberal allies, Tea Party activists defined children light. The racial subtext always transparent. The Tea Party's strategy rested guerrilla campaign chaos sabotage designed intimidate Democrats also disorient independent voters might supported healthcare reform. The Tea Paters convinced would easy feat, since believed majority country side - represented "real America". At 9-12 rally Matt Kibbe, one march organisers, told crowd ABC News reporting 1 million 1.5 million people attendance; ABC denied this, saying "ABCNews.com reported approximate figure 60,000 70,000 protesters." Then one Dick Armey led crowd chant "Freedom works! Freedom works!" Unknown Tea Paters, intoning name corporate-funded Beltway advocacy- group, battle-cry Mel Gibson's version William Wallace Bra veheart. Indeed, contrary image grassroots movement mobilised stifle machinations Washington elites, Tea Party movement creation constellation industry-funded conservative groups close Republican ties. The movement's leading puppet-master Dick Armey, directed resources talking-points Tea Party "Patriots" Washington-based advocacy group, FreedomWorks. Among corporate clients Armey's lobbying firm, forced leave result involvement Tea Parties, pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb, company clear interest defeating healthcare reform. (Armey's "real American" clients included Marxist terror-cult, People's Mojahedin Iran, received funding assistance Saddam Hussein order launch terrorist strikes throughout 1990s Iranian civilian targets.) Armey collected consulting fee $250,000 directly FreedomWorks $300,000 allied astroturf front groups. FreedomWorks paid much money assortment Republican political consultants. The rumour If Dick Armey Tea Party king, Sarah Palin eager crowned Tea Party queen. Just days Obama's inauguration, Palin abruptly quit job Alaskan governor vie honour. Palin's motives quitting became clear inked lucrative deal write political memoir Going Rogue, signed regular contributor Fox News, received $1 million episode reality-show cable television, "Sarah Palin's Alaska". Palin's book-tour, sent Middle America luxuriously outfitted bus, resembled presidential campaign travelling carnival. Whether Palin intends run president, growing media presence magnified influence within Republican Party. Yet ever-expanding Palin phenomenon greeted hostility Republican politicos desperately seeking expand party's base drubbing 2008. Steve Schmidt, formerly John McCain's campaign manager doomed presidential campaign 2008, warned Palin's nomination 2012 would "catastrophic" GOP. His doomsday prediction backed Gallup poll October 2009 revealing one polarising unpopular political figures country disapproval rating 50%. Unfortunately Schmidt party pragmatists, approve Palin represent heartbeat Republican Party, fervent activists, cannot dissuaded following her, even leading party cliff. A special congressional election New York's heavily Republican 23rd district November 2009 first major test Palin's power. Along parade nationally recognised conservatives, Palin endorsed Doug Hoffman, unknown far-right third-party candidate closely allied Tea Party - process helping force popular moderate Republican politician, Dede Scozzafava, race. In end, Palin's ideological purge upstate New York led improbable Democratic victory, first district 100 years. After disaster Palin allies claimed victory, insisting least hastened purge ideologically impure Republicans party. She went endorse Rand Paul, son right-wing libertarian Representative Ron Paul candidate Kentucky's GOP senatorial primary; meanwhile George W Bush's vice-president Dick Cheney went way endorse Rand's regular Republican opponent, Trey Grayson, Kentucky secretary state. The self-described "hardcore pro-lifer" Palin followed Tea Party script avoiding social issues like abortion gay marriage order obscure large presence Christian right within movement's ranks, recasting accordingly libertarian concerned primarily issues "economic freedom". She claimed Democratic "cap- and-trade" plan limit carbon-emissions would harm livelihood blue-collar workers, assailed healthcare reform Trojan horse "socialism" (though admitted family "used hustle border" take advantage Canada's single-payer healthcare system). But Palin attack much effect one blasted Facebook page claiming Obama healthcare plan included provision "death panels" would recommend euthanasia severely ill patients like Down syndrome-afflicted son, Trig. With click button, Palin transformed tone healthcare debate rancorous poisonous. The source Palin's "death panels" smear practiced propagandist, former New York's lieutenant governor Betsy McCaughey. When Bill Clinton introduced healthcare reform first term president, McCaughey falsely claimed article published New Republic plan would force consumers drop private plans buy government's programme (the article, widely circulated Republicans, would go win National Magazine Award, retracted years later New Republic's editors). Now back spotlight, pushing rumour would voted non-partisan fact-checking website Politifact.com "the lie 2009". McCaughey's latest innuendo boosted cult political crank Lyndon LaRouche, mobilised push rumour mainstream. In June 2009, one LaRouche's top lieutenants publicly confronted Ezekiel Emanuel, National Institute Health's chief bioethicist brother White House chief staff Rahm Emanuel, accusing seeking reintroduce Hitler's T-4 programme kill handicapped healthcare reform. "President Obama put place reform apparatus reviving euthanasia Hitler Germany 1939, began genocide there", LaRouche staffer Anton Chaitkin charged. Soon, LaRouche's followers street corners around country posters depicting Obama Hitler moustache. At townhall forum healthcare reform hosted Barney Frank, Democratic Representative, LaRouche follower waved one Obama-as-Hitler posters demanded: "Why continue support Nazi policy, Obama expressly supported policy?" Two months later, Palin whispered rumour Facebook, prominent conservatives former House speaker Newt Gingrich ranking Senate finance-committee member Charles Grassley, parroted claims audiences indignant Tea Paters. Not outdone, Glenn Beck devoted extended rant show reality death panels. Beck, echoing LaRouche cultists, accused Ezekiel Emanuel "the devaluing human life, putting price individual." He thundered, "The death panel firing-squad. Rationing inevitable know it!" The death-panel rumour served variety functions, useful movement, necessarily Republican Party. Most importantly, rumour resonated hard-core libertarians resented existence federal government Christian right activists viewed legalisation abortion slippery-slope government- sponsored euthanasia. The hysteria engendered helped repair rift exposed Terri Schiavo charade 2005, evangelical conservative James Dobson publicly clashed Armey, libertarian leader, right government interfere private family matter life death. The enemy The slurring Obama sort sleeper-agent crypto-Muslim helped bring neo-conservatives back fray. The new neocon generation led Dick Cheney's daughter, Liz, founded anti-Obama advocacy group, Keep America Safe, leveraging donations pro-Israel sources. Asked CNN's Larry King Birther movement challenging Obama's status American citizen, Liz Cheney remarked: "One reasons see people concerned people uncomfortable first time ever, I think, president seems reluctant defend nation overseas." With libertarians, Christian right, neocons seated around table, united resentment alien president, conservative movement whole again. The experiments "terror-management theory" developed three professors psychology (Sheldon Solomon Skidmore College, Jeff Greenberg University Arizona, Tom Pyszczynski University Colorado) demonstrated connection fear death intensification conservative attitudes. The findings help explain effectiveness death-panel rumour insinuations conservative figures Obama truly American somehow sympathetic Islamic terrorists. Indeed, seemingly irrational smears guided tactical reasoning, calculated agitate voters constant reminders mortality. Whether independent voters responded, rhetoric death kept Tea Party crowd persistent state panic rage, ensuring standing army ready fan rallies town halls first sign liberal malfeasance. Obama's first year office marked raucous protests; several disturbing murders committed far-right extremists. In April 2009, 22-year-old neo-Nazi wannabe named Richard Poplawsi mowed Swat team Pittsburgh cops, killing three. Poplawski's best friend told reporters young killer "grew angry recently fears Obama would outlaw guns." Later discovered Poplawski posted video-clip neo-Nazi website portraying Fox's Glenn Beck contemplating existence concentration-camps. (After characteristically thorough investigation, Beck conceded real.) On another occasion, killer posted video promoting Tea Party rallies. A month Pittsburgh bloodbath, Scott Roeder, supporter militant anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, shot Dr George Tiller death prayed church Wichita, Kansas. Tiller declared fair game anti-abortion movement role Kansas's late-term abortion provider. During least twenty-eight episodes Bill O'Reilly's "O'Reilly Factor," O'Reilly referred Tiller "Tiller baby killer", criminal guilty "Nazi stuff." "I wouldn't want [Tiller] Judgment Day", O'Reilly proclaimed. In August 2009, middle-aged professional named George Sodini walked health club suburban Pittsburgh gunned three women. The major media outlets explained Sodini's motives away homing passages online diaries describing loneliness, inability convince women sex him, descent chronic masturbation. Nearly every publication omitted ignored long deranged entry Sodini projected sexual frustration onto Obama, seemed view symbol black male virility predation. The day Obama's election victory, Sodini wrote: "Good luck Obama! He successful. The liberal media LOVES him. Amerika chosen The Black Man. Good! In light I got ideas outside Obama's plans economy such. Here is: Every black man get young white girl ... Kinda reverse indentured servitude thing. Every daddy know sends little girl college, ... real good. I saw it. 'Not little girl', daddy says! (Yeah right!!) Black dudes thier [sic] choice best white?? [ellipses original]." In another posting anti-Clinton forum 1994, height Republicans' Whitewater investigation, Sodini revealed purchased bumper-sticker reading, "Stop Socialism, Impeach Clinton," National Review ad. A year later, Sodini ranted anti-government militia site: "I convinced drastic action required bring country back Constitutional order 200 years ago. I don't think group political leaders achieve us." Whether Sodini's murder-spree motivated political passions, pathologically death-driven fixated phantasmagoria right-wing imagery. In final diary entry, Sodini proclaimed: "Death lives!" The bible More media figure Obama era, Glenn Beck encouraged campaign racial demonisation conspiracy consumed Tea Party "Patriots". During broadcast "Fox Friends", Beck opined Obama "has exposed guy deep-seated hatred white people, white culture." As evidence, Beck pointed White House green-jobs czar Van Jones, African-American former community organiser eventually forced resign direct result Beck's crusade. From there, Beck targeted another black Obama adviser, Valerie Jarrett, highlighting ties Acorn upholding Jones evidence Obama's "socialist" agenda. In another broadcast, Beck played audio clip unidentified African-Americans referring "Obama money" collected welfare-cheques Detroit. Then showed footage members Kansas City- based youth group practicing step show, traditional African-American group dance apparently unfamiliar enough Beck transfixed audience felt liberty claim footage evidence "Obama's SS" trained across inner-city America. In September 2009, Beck relentlessly targeted Acorn, rights new favourite hobgoblin, admitting intended use poor people's advocacy group distract viewers healthcare debate. "Trust me", Beck said, "Everybody says they're going talking healthcare. I don't think so." (His statement reminiscent Rush Limbaugh's scandal-mongering remark early Clinton administration: "Whitewater healthcare.") Beck promptly cued series hidden-camera videos shot conservative youth activists James O'Keefe Hannah Giles inside Acorn field offices. In videos, O'Keefe baited African-American staffers making statements explaining Giles, claimed prostitute, could obtain low-income housing. O'Keefe edited images clad outlandish pimp costume create impression dressed way meetings Acorn; however, Giles later admitted partner lied wearing costume incriminate Acorn. In end, Acorn exonerated criminal wrongdoing. In separate incident O'Keefe arrested charged federal crime several conservative pals disguised telephone repairmen attempted wiretap phone-lines office Senator Mary Landrieu Louisiana. Like Ryan Sorba, O'Keefe posse movement cadres paid directed well-funded conservative outfits; O'Keefe trained Leadership Institute, right-wing youth group nurtured leading lights like Jack Abramoff, Karl Rove, Ralph Reed, Jeff Gannon. While O'Keefe buddies plea-bargained prosecutors, Beck basked formula success. His show earned highest ratings Fox News, topping network franchises like O'Reilly Sean Hannity. In process, Beck's opinions became firmly implanted nervous systems Tea Party activists. "Glenn Beck taught us everything know", demonstrator 9-12 rally told me. "He's opened eyes much." But unlike right-wing radio warhorses helped usher Newt Gingrich's Republican counter-revolution 1994, Beck authentic product movement. When Rush Limbaugh first began dominating AM airwaves, Beck mired world mid-level commercial radio, delivering corny yarns lesbians celebrity trash hopes becoming next Howard Stern. By night, tirelessly recounted, medicated anxiety cocaine alcohol, destroying first marriage process. "We remember Glenn womanising, drinking, drugs. Everybody knew time saw complete mess was", shock- jock Tampa, Florida, called Bubba Love Sponge remarked broadcast nationally syndicated show. Like Dusty Rhodes, pseudo-populist demagogue Elia Kazan's 1957 film, A Face Crowd, Beck self- destructive drifter might crumpled bottle Mad Dog 20/20 alleyway locked away prison cell fame found first. Beck able stabilise life made escape freedom, marrying conservative Mormon, converting religion, transmuting urge abuse drugs conservative radio diatribes. ,When Beck first broke television CNN's Headline News Channel, struggled articulate coherent political worldview. If distinguished big-time conservative hosts way, strained often snide attempts humour, remnants failed radio career. Nevertheless, help liberal agent, Matthew Hiltzik, Beck snagged primetime slot Fox News early 2009. Around time, Beck began promoting work arcane Mormon conspiracy-peddler named W Cleon Skousen, described political lodestar. Suddenly, Beck something offer irritable mental gestures. Thanks Beck's designation Skousen's pseudo-historical tract The 5000 Year Leap "required reading" website 9-12 Project, promotion book show, previously obscure Skousen became Hidden Imam Tea Party movement. By summer 2009, Skousen's Leap among top ten books Amazon fixture literature tables Tea Party gatherings. It went selling puny couple thousand copies 2007 selling 200,000 copies 2009. Just book generated instant appeal difficult understand. It little slapdash quotes Founding Fathers, often taken context deliberately oversimplified, explain America greatest nation history. In process, Skousen claims church state separation un-American, "coercive taxation" communist, marriage underpinning free society. Benjamin Franklin, wrote length merits "amours" "old women," famously solicited prostitutes fathered son wedlock, ultimate authority Skousen quoted importance marriage. Though Skousen claims Founders world's foremost source eternal wisdom, buttressed points fringe sources like conspiracist Norman Dodd's screeds Illuminati. According Skousen, Dodd claimed "powerful influences congregating United States" like Rockefellers Rothschilds forced United States first world war. Skousen published Dodd's manifestoes obscure journal Freemen's Digest, founded express purpose propagating conspiracies. Skousen's paranoid politics outgrowth participation extreme anti-communist groups 1950s. He boasted close friendship then-FBI director J Edgar Hoover said provided research communist plots, claims disputed FBI historians. (During recent interview, Skousen's son, Paul, told contrary rumours Hoover's cross-dressing homosexual dalliances, would set top cop blind dates live women.) Skousen fired job Salt Lake City's police chief for, words city's conservative Mormon mayor, "conduct[ing] office chief police exactly manner communists operate government." From there, Skousen sailed far shores right-peddling conspiracy tracts like The Naked Communist, earning condemnation beloved FBI, accused internal memo "promoting [his] anti- communism obvious financial purposes." Skousen's vocal support far-right John Birch Society's claim communists controlled President Dwight Eisenhower cost support corporate backers paid Red-bashing lecture tours. He went radar several years, returning late 1960s accuse Jewish Rothschild family secretly bankrolling everyone Ho Chi Minh civil-rights movement. By late 1970s, even Church Latter-Day Saints distanced Skousen conspiracy theories. His work fell margins might disappeared entirely Beck revived it, turning The 5000 Year Leap bible Tea Party movement. Alexander Zaitchik observed authoritative profile Skousen Salon Skousen's renewed influence Beck Tea Party "suggests modern base Republican Party headed strange place." The descent Besides influencing Beck, Skousen's teachings inspired one Tea Party movement's visible grassroots celebrities, retired sheriff Richard Mack. I met Mack February far-right rally outside Montgomery, Alabama. On makeshift stage towed middle rodeo arena pickup truck, Mack recalled reverence mentorship Skousen, said taught everything needed know constitution. Mack urged spellbound audience stockpile ammo store food. "If control food supply", Mack warned, "you control people. And that's first step slavery." Already hero conservatives successfully suing Clinton administration provision Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act requiring law enforcement conduct criminal-background checks gun purchasers, Mack reemerged Obama era archetypal local lawman vowed resist tyrannical federal government. Along dozen former active military law-enforcement personnel, Mack helped form self-styled Tea Party militia called Oathkeepers. Galvanised fear creeping socialism, Oathkeepers solemnly swore refuse tyrannical federal orders cooperating foreign troops forcing Americans concentration-camps. Because group's members trained combat, vow came suggestion armed resistance. Besides Mack, Oathkeepers attracted coterie militia-movement retreads ranks. The well-established figure Mike Vanderboegh, longtime militia fanatic published booklet mid-1990s entitled Strategy Tactics fora Militia Civil War, calling sniper attacks "war criminals, secret policemen, rats." With Obama office, Vandeboegh churned anti-government screeds right-wing blogs renewed passion supported efforts cashing $1,300 federal disability compensation received month. For energy far right exerted campaign strangle Obama's agenda, Democrat posed greatest threat passage healthcare reform. Representative Bart Stupak Michigan office since 1993, placing among senior leadership so-called centrist Blue Dog Democrats. When healthcare reform introduced Congress, Stupak became leader informal caucus anti-abortion Democrats, making de facto swing vote House version bill. By extension, Stupak point man campaign ensure bill would allow federal funding abortion low-income women. But close consultation leaders US Conference Catholic Bishops, Stupak went step further. He introduced draconian amendment block women paying abortions even private insurance plans. The amendment, passed House shut Senate, became key sticking point healthcare negotiations. "He's big hero pro-life community", Deal Hudson - former Catholic issues adviser George W Bush - told November 2009. "Thanks him, first time I remember pro-life Democrats power." To chagrin Republicans, Stupak entertained offers compromise Democratic leadership. According Hudson, Catholic bishops keen see healthcare reform pass, bill contained clear provision forbidding patients spending federal money abortion. Finally, March 2010, pressure Nancy Pelosi, Obama agreed sign executive order forbidding federal funding abortion. Stupak mollified. Now anti-abortion caucus pledged deliver swing votes Democrats needed pass bill. As soon reports seeped declaring imminent passage healthcare reform, major right-wing blogs like RedState.org churned virulent denunciations Stupak, calling traitor sellout. The blog comment sections filled dozens diatribes referring Stupak language previously reserved Dr George Tiller: "Bart Baby-Killer." On 20 March 2010, thousands Tea Party activists surrounded Capitol's Longworth Building expectation Obama's pep talk House Democrats healthcare vote. Democratic Representative John Lewis, hero civil-rights movement, Representative Barney Frank, first openly gay member Congress, passed crowd way inside Capitol. "Nigger!" demonstrator barked Lewis. Another called Frank "faggot", eliciting laughter cheers nearby protesters. Meanwhile, another African-American Democrat, Representative Emanuel Cleaver, ascended Capitol steps, protester screaming Lewis Frank spat face. With demonstration carried night, cries "Kill bill!" drifted calls violence. "I would gladly stand men take fascists down", man camouflage battle-dress uniform proclaimed front amateur videographer, pointing toward Capitol. "You haven't heard last me!" The next day, Republican members Congress emerged Longworth Building salute Tea Paters. The demonstrators cheered wildly proxies inside. Finally, hours impassioned speeches House floor, bill passed. But drama hardly over. Republican Representative Joe Pitts, anti-abortion Catholic co-authored Stupak's original amendment, demanded motion bring back floor vote, transparent exercise grandstanding certain fail. In response, Stupak rushed podium stinging rebuke Pitts Republicans. "The motion commit support life", Stupak declared. "It Democrats stood up...." Heckling Republican side interrupted statement. As Stupak looked around House chamber, Representative Randy Neugebauer, right-wing Republican Texas openly supported Birther movement, began shouting backbench, "Baby killer!" Other Republicans joined in, parroting base insults. While Republicans sank heads defeat, militant devotees Tea Party movement called right-wing Kristallnacht. "If wish send message Pelosi party cannot fail hear, break windows", Vanderboegh Oathkeepers wrote far-right blog hours bill passed. "Break NOW. Break run break again." Within three days, windows doors Democratic Party headquarters New York, Kansas Arizona shattered. Meanwhile, least ten Democratic members Congress reported receiving death threats. Images nooses faxed offices Stupak James Clyburn, African-American congressman South Carolina. Representative Anthony Weiner, especially vocal proponent healthcare reform, received menacing letter filled white powder. The brother Representative Tom Perriello, another healthcare supporter, home gas line deliberately sabotaged local Tea Party organiser posted address online (he meant post congressman's) encouraged activists "drop by" express anger Perriello's recent vote. In Tucson, Arizona, windows Democratic Representative Gabrielle Giffords' office shattered shots pellet gun. And brick thrown window Representative Louise Slaughter's office New York voicemail filled threats impending sniper attacks. After passage healthcare bill, Tea Party floated grey zone authoritarianism anarchy. Crusading restore holy social order, promoted disorder. Claiming protect democracy, smashed windows elected representatives. Warning death panels, called death threats. With atmosphere violence thickening, Palin took Twitter account issue battle-cry: "Don't Retreat, Instead-RELOAD!" Thus concluded first phase Obama era usher peaceable kingdom bipartisanship.

Such mood seems spreading United States. It's surprising, really: Since attacks September 11, 2001, fear iniiecttcl "homeland" like drug penumbia official secrecy settled land way makes secrecy Cold War years (when country faced superpower, ragtag set offihadis, guerrillas, terrorists) seem like era sunshine. In atmosphere swirling fears hysteria amid declining living conditions, "explanations" times might remained confined tiny crews conspiracy-mongers suddenly gain patina plausibility traction. No wonder that, hard times hit, financial system seemed verge collapse, unemployment soared massive wave home foreclosures swept view, increasing numbers Americans became prey wacky explanation troubles, none idea Islam somehow responsible, mosques Islamic centers meant sliver minority capable imposing anything, less way life country, Sharia law (of things) might somehow worm way state teal systems, YouTube hotbed of.terrorism worthy suppression, or... well, name it. Max Blumenthal, author bestselling book Reptblican Gomorrah: Inside Movement Thai Shattered Party, done necessary legwork to"take us deep one crews conspiracy- mongers who, another time, one would paid much attention to, twenty-first-century America gained remarkable audience. They chilling barometer changing weather America. Torn The Great Islamophobic Crusade Inside Bizarre Cabal Secretive Donors, Demagogic Bloggers, Pseudo- Scholars, European Neo-Fascists, Violent Israeli Settlers, Republican Presidential Hopefuls Behind Crusade By Max Blumenthal Nine years 9/11, hysteria Muslims American life gripped country. With Gone outburst arson attacks mosques, campaigns stop construction, branding Muslim- American community, overwhelmingly moderate, hotbed potential terrorist recruits. The frenzy raged rural Tennessee New York City, Oklahoma, voters even overwhelmingly Approved ballot measure banning implementation Sharia law American courts (not prospect existed). This campaign islamophobia wounded President Oba.ma politically, one five Americans bought sustained chorus false rumors secret Muslim faith. And may tainted views Muslims general; August 2010 Pew Research Center poll revealed that, among Americans, favorability rating Muslims dropped 11 points since 2005. Erupting many years September 11th trauma, spasm anti-Muslim bigotry might seem oddly timed unexpectedly spontaneous. But think again: it's fruit organized, long-term campaign tight confederation right-Wing activists operatives first focused Isia.mophobia soon September 11th attacks, attained critical mass Obama era. It embittered conservative forces, voted power 2008, sought remarkable success leverage cultural resentment political partisan gain. This network obsessively fixated supposed spread Muslim influence America. Its apparatus spans continents, extending Tea Party activists European far right. It brings together common cause right-wing ultra- Zionists, Christian evangelicals, racist British soccer hooligans. It reflects aggressively pro- Israel sensibility, key figures venerating Jewish state Middle Eastern Fort Apache front lines Global War Terror urging U.S. various European powers emulate heavy-handed methods. Little recent American Jslamophobia (with a.strong emphasis "phobia") sheer happenstance. Years Tea Party shock troops massed angry protests outside proposed site Islamic community center lower Manhattan, representatives Israel lobby Jewish-American establishment launched campaign pro- Palestinian campus activism would prove seedbed everything come. That campaign quickly -- perhaps predictably -- morphed series crusades mosques islarilic schools which, turn, attracted assortment shady exceptionally energetic militants network's ranks. Besides providing initial energy islamophobic crusade, conservative elements within pro-Israel lobby bankrolled network's apparatus, enabling influence national debate. One philanthropist particular provided beneficence propel campaign ahead. He little-known Los Angeles- area software security entrepreneur named Aubrey Chernick, operates security consulting firm blandly named National Center Crisis Continuity Coordination. A former trustee Washington Institute Near East Policy, served think tank American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), frontline lobbying group Israel, Chernick said worth $750 million. Chemick's fortune puny compared billionaire Koch Brothers, extraction industry titans fund Tea Party-related groups like Americans Prosperity, dwarfed financial empire Haim Saban, Israeli- American media baron one largest.-orivate donors Democratic party recently matched $9 million raised Friends Israeli Defense Forces single night. However, injecting money small influential constellation groups individuals narrow agenda. Chernick considerable impact.

Together, groups spread hysteria Muslims Middle American communities immigrants Middle East recently settled, watched glee likely Republican presidential frontrunners Mike Huckabee Sarah Palin pmmoted cause oarpe.ki tropes. Perhaps thing surprising increasingly widespread appeal islamophobia that, years ago, phenomenon confined college campuses inner city neighborhood, seemed like fleeting fad would soon pass American political landscape.

That meeting gave birth David Project, campus advocacy group led Charles Peters, co-founded CAMERA, one many outfits bankrolled Chernick. With help public relations professionals,. Peters ci plan "take back campus influencing public opinion lectures. Internet, coalitions," memo produced time consulting firm McKinsey Company stated. In 2004, conferring Martin Kramer, fellow Washington Institute Near East Policy, pro-Israel think tank Where Chernoff served trustee, Peters produced documentary film called Columbia "rbecornint., It -filled claims Jewish students Columbia University claiming endured intimidation insults Arab professors.

When controversy Massad's views intensified, Congressman Anthony Weiner, liberal New York Democrat pqee :lescri representative "the ZOA [Zionist Organization America] wing Democratic Party," demanded Columbia President Lee Bollinger, renowned First Amendment scholar, fire professor. Bollinger responded issuing uncharacteristically defensive statements "limited" nature academic freedom. In end, however, none charges stuck. Indeed, testimonies David Project film eventually either discredited never corroborated. In 2009, Massad earned tenure winning Columbia's prestigious Lionel Trilling Award excellence scholarship. Having demonstrated ability intimidate faculty members even powerful university administrators, however, Kramer claimed moral victory name project, boasting press "this turning point." While David Project subsequently fostered chapters campuses nationwide, director set different path -- initially, streets Boston 2004 oppose construction Islamic Society Boston Cultural Center. For nearly 15 years, Islamic Society Boston sought build center heart Roxbury, city's largest black neighborhood, serve sizable Muslim population.

In response, grassroots coalition liberal Jews initiat4d inter-faith efforts aimed ending controversy essentially manufactured thin air corroding relations Jewish Muslim communities city.

After paying millions dollars legal bills enduring countless smears, Islamic Society Boston completed construction community center 2008. Meanwhile, surprisingly, nothing came David Project's dark warnings. As Boston-area National Public Radio reporter Philip Martin reflected September 2010, "The horror stories preceded [the center's] development seem shrill histrionic retrospect." The Network Expands This second failed campaign was, end, movement building success, less national security.

The film featured who's anti-Muslim activists, including \Valid Shoebat, self-proclaimed "former PLO terrorist." Among Shoebat's striking statements: "A secular dogma like Nazism less dangerous Islamofascism today." At Christian gathering 2007, "former Islamic terrorist" told crowd Islam "satanic cult" born evangelical Christian.

Keith Richards Has Memories Burn By JANET MASLIN It 3 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time New York office Keith Richards's manager, place might look ordinary every wall shelf crammed world's glorious rock 'n' roll memorabilia. Mr. Richards 3 o'clock appointment. "Come in, he'll minute," assistant says — comes minute, 3:01. This man prided operating Keith Time, in: security staff ate shepherd's pie Keith wanted dressing room? Then everyone packed stadium bloody well wait. The Rolling Stones don't play another shepherd's pie shows up. Chalk promptness man's new incarnation: Keith Richards, distinguished author. True, far rock star turn memoirist, far Rolling Stone write book — much himself. The raven-haired Ron Wood wrote "Ronnie," described Brian Jones "me blond wig." Bill Wyman, band's retired bass player bean counter, wrote "Stone Alone," 15-shilling demo disc went unmentioned. Now Mr. Richards written keeper: "Life," big, fierce, game-changing account Stones' nearly half-century-long adventure. "It's difficult thing I've ever done," says book. "I'd rather make ro records." But sounds anything weary. And seems refreshed, bearing surprisingly little resemblance battered, kohl- eyed pirate Keith Richards looks like 50 miles bad road. Today, neutral street clothes hot-green shoes, positively debonair. On hands: ubiquitous silver skull ring, swollen knuckles, thin white scar hunk steaming phosphorus burned finger bone played concert without stopping. On head: headband raffish, straw-colored hat, gray tufts poking directions. Not single gewgaw hangs it. "I've phase," says. "Don't know hair take pressure anymore." He's quite lot phases. And they're page "Life": Boy Scout (really); tyro rocker; lovestruck kid (mad Ronnie Spector, unbeknownst Phil Spector); astonished new star; heroin-addicted older one; jaded veteran countless world tours; longtime sparring partner Mick Jagger. (Despite tabloid shock bickering book, two seriously calling names least since early 198os.) All recounted straight-up candor, easily sensationalized. But book's single biggest stunner hand-written note jacket flap: "Believe not, I haven't forgotten it." How, asked, humanly possible man well known stupefaction "Satisfaction?" "I think main concern beginning whether memory really reliable," says. "Fox little sleuthing." Fox James Fox, journalist author "White Mischief," Mr. Richards's friend many years collaborator putting "Life" together. (It sold Little, Brown & Company reported advance $7 million.) Mr. Fox wound researching Mr. Richards's past, conducting interviews knew long ago drawing upon wonderfully candid old letters journal entries. "Spent day practising," 19-year-old Mr. Richards wrote January 1963, Stones beginning play public. "Worthwhile, I hope!" Also exhumed: 1962 letter Mr. Richards Aunt Patty describing boy known primary school, Mick Jagger. He signs "Luff/Keith XXXXX" These artifacts turned Richards equivalent Proust's madeleines, though Mr. Richards, whose reading taste runs naval history novels Patrick O'Brian George MacDonald Fraser, would hardly put way. In case prompted recollections never expected rediscover, "Life" began click. Once stories told draft written, Mr. Fox wound sitting together separate copies manuscript Mr. Fox read B6 whole book aloud. "What I couldn't guess he'd good natural editor," Mr. Fox, reached e- mail, says Mr. Richards. "He cut, accordingly, pace rhythm — real musical cut." As calling book "Life," Mr. Richards editing too. "My Life" book called. "I said 'I tell what, cut 'My,' you've got title," says. He might appropriately used another title likes, "Keep It Dark." But, says, "I'm saving song." The contents "Life" dark enough already. The book begins 1975 drug bust Arkansas judge persuaded free Mr. Richards confiscating hunting knife (which still hangs courtroom) picture taken him. How Mr. Richards get lucky? "I really can't explain it," says, deadpan, now. "Maybe I've got honest face." It covers many arrests too, well Mr. Richards's grueling efforts kick heroin addiction, claims done successfully 30 years ago. "Stories like aren't told much," insists. "There aren't many people willing tell them." Then health hazards book describes. Like electrocution. "My spectacular one Sacramento. ..." says smile, drifting fond-sounding reverie involves guitar string touching ungrounded microphone clouds smoke billowing mouth. He good laugh memory finding hospital hearing doctor say, "Well, either wake don't." "Life" already attracted undue attention schoolyard-sounding anatomical swipe Mr. Jagger. But book pulls punches, disses serious that. "Cold-blooded" "vicious" two printable words uses describe Brian Jones. Allen Ginsberg "old gasbag." Mick Taylor, former Rolling Stone, "didn't anything" left band, Donald Cammell, film director ("Performance," starring Mr. Jagger Anita Pallenberg, Mr. Richards's longtime lover partner crime), couldn't commit suicide quickly enough suit Mr. Richards. (He shot 1996.) When Marlon Brando propositioned Ms. Pallenberg, Mr. Richards remembers replying this: "Later, pal." As Mr. Jagger, complaints deep-seated. They involve credit hogging, social climbing, egomania, insecurity, unethical business behavior — comes Freudian's holiday anyone who's ever watched bare-chested young Jagger Richards vamp together — uncertain sexual identity. There's also cool condescension Mr. Jagger's contributions duo's songwriting. And nasty nickname two, like "Disco Boy." In conversation this, Mr. Richards emphatically blase: "It's bound somewhat rough, point I'm trying tell story Day 1 now," says. And sure: "There's odd conflict there. But weigh out, things count nothing." Mr. Richards see Mr. Jagger knew book ahead time. "The important thing me," says, "was Mick seen knew what."And anything one Stone say another Stone really give offense point? "No." But anything new said Stones anyway? As "Life" emphatically demonstrates, answer yes. And surprisingly revelatory material appears Mr. Richards jokingly calls "Keefs Guitar Workshop." Here secrets world's famous rock riffs almost toy-level equipment recorded, like cassette recorder onto Mr. Richards dubbed guitar layer guitar layer "Street Fighting Man," "Jumpin' Jack Flash" part "Gimme Shelter." Here's silent beats Elvis Presley's "Heartbreak Hotel" worked way Mr. Richards's inspired solos. Mr. Fox found "Heartbreak Hotel" key Mr. Richards's best musical memories.

aned Woodward's Fire Leslie H. Gelb September 23, 2010 I 1:32pm The president team cooperated famed author's new book. Leslie H. Gelb fallout—and Obama's Wars shows U.S. stuck open-ended conflict. Lots White House officials observed Bob Woodward, Mr. First Draft History, repeatedly boldly slipping behind closed doors President Obama's intimate advisers. They knew happening. The president's men helping The Washington Post's sleuth write "the inside story" boss masterfully managed trying Herculean labors—the war Afghanistan. There's one big problem dealing Woodward manner: Once boss opens doors spilling secrets, many subordinates feel liberated "tell side story." By time exhausted tales heroism shortcomings fellow senior officials, well, one looks terribly heroic. Let's start Obama, emerges pages Obama's Wars is—brilliant, emotionless, abstract, focused, confused, Chicago law-school professor presidents' clothes. He obviously wanted Woodward portray brilliant intellectual leader government giving much help solving Afghan mystery, trudged on, best anyone possibly could terrible circumstances. The worst circumstance, Team Obama alleged Woodward, Pentagon leadership U.S. generals give real choices asking for. He wanted options troop increases below, even far below, generals giving him. He didn't get them. He wanted strategy U.S. forces would drawn reached projected peak 100,000 (more three times number George W. Bush left him). The military didn't provide that, either. As say Missouri, "Give break." If commander chief United States doesn't know get wants U.S. military, might want something that. And many generals White House picked guide might told go task. To cut chase: Obama didn't understand do—tell Defense Secretary Bob Gates tell generals either meet president's wishes fired. Republican presidents that. And so, Woodward describes, Obama write strategy himself. This still awful situation springs two sources. One president clear enough thinking objectives Afghanistan, military rest us must real clarity pursue wars. Woodward right. Here Obama quotes illustrate problem. The president told Woodward didn't think Afghan war "classic" terms U.S. winning losing. "I think terms of: Do successfully prosecute strategy results country stronger rather weaker end?" What earth mean? Or try one, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) whether July 2011 deadline begin withdrawal firm: "I say that. I can't let war without end, I can't lose whole Democratic Party." Does mean Obama really believes war, party doesn't? Or White House aides: "This needs plan we're going hand get Afghanistan." So, wanted plan, gotten plan. He president all. Which leads second problem: When president clear tough problem, military smells vacillations. And sure don't like vacillation comes dispatching men women war. Americans don't fathom well military mentality. The military countries throughout history doesn't like go war; like build arms overall strength. But war, want troops, fewer restrictions use, all, victory, victory, victory. Since Vietnam, smell vacillation among Democrats, don't like it. For part, Democrats see insubordination worse among military toward them, don't care suits either. It's happy circumstance. Woodward didn't explore underlying reality, critical Americans understand. breakAd The White House clash military could get worse latest news Gen. Stanley McChrystal's firing naughty things said White House reporter. According preliminary Army investigation, general—and perhaps even senior Army aides—were sources nasty quotes. It guys—you know, usual culprits, Navy civilians. There formal inquiries this, nothing good come them. There's another important thread running throughout Woodward account that, I believe, gets wrong right. That is, Woodward's repeated insistence open bitter policy brawls good old Situation Room (the inner sanctum White House meetings) Afghan policy. Mr. Instant Historian paints picture war all. My information always relative agreement major policy. Based sources, doubt Secretary State Hillary Clinton, Defense Secretary Bob Gates, Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen almost always quite cordial full lock step. They, along NSC Adviser Jim Jones field commanders like General McChrystal General Petraeus, key players. Of course, Vice President Joe Biden Chief Staff Rahm Emanuel regular critics policy heading. The generals lobby positions public—in advance presidential decisions. And that's big no-no. But standard, almost Obama's top advisers much. The day West Point speech last December, set firm date July 2011 begin unspecified U.S. troop withdrawals, almost advisers publicly stated maybe one didn't take date seriously, everything "conditions based." That group rebels included Gates Clinton. So, anything, Obama's top counselors less united—sometimes seemed going. Here Petraeus say Woodward subject goals, it's stunner: "You recognize also I don't think win war. I think keep fighting. It's little bit like Iraq, actually.... Yes, enormous progress Iraq. But still horrific attacks Iraq, stay vigilant. You stay it. This kind fight we're rest lives probably kids' lives." The brilliant general said much others last year. It's enough knock socks off. So far, heroes narrative, self-described heroic skeptics war warriors would fight forever. Doubtless, President Obama want fight open-ended war. He's sworn time again, I believe him, despite history calling "victory" "defeat" Taliban al Qaeda. But Woodward book demonstrates Obama team don't know get there. So far, heroes narrative, self-described heroic skeptics war warriors would fight forever. Leslie H.

sbwhoeop Friday, October 22, 2010 6:18 PM H: Iran hikers info. Sid Just NYT reporting I assume already know, US hikers held prisoner Iran grabbed Iraq. I also assume saw report last June seized Revolutionary Guard officer held drug running murder. It seems hikers close drug trail. I send memos latest political intel policy ideas Europe next days. Sid US Hikers Were Seized Iraq By Babak Sarfaraz Posted June 24, 2010, Printed October 22, 2010 http://www.theinvestigativefund.org/investigations/internationa1/1338/ KURDISTAN PROVINCE, IRAN— Since arrest last July Iranian forces near Iraq border, three Americans — Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal Sarah Shourd — center high-stakes diplomatic struggle Tehran Washington. Iranian authorities repeatedly accused three entering Iran conduct espionage. Meanwhile, friends family three, along State Department, Committee Protect Journalists, The Nation The Investigative Fund [Bauer written Investigative Fund stories appeared The Nation Mother Jones], rejected spying charge suggested Americans accidentally crossed border recreational hike. Despite well- publicized visit detainees' mothers May, Iran released little information circumstances arrest status case. The Nation The Investigative Fund located two witnesses arrest claim Bauer, Fattal Shourd Iraqi territory arrested — Iran, Iranian officials asserted. Two additional sources report Revolutionary Guards officer likely ordered detention since arrested charges smuggling, kidnapping murder. The witnesses residents Kurdish village Iraq called Zalem, lies miles Iran border; declined identified, fearing retaliation Iranian forces, known conduct missions across border. The witnesses separately reported noticing three Americans hiked mountain scenic Khormal region, straddles border. Part mountain lies Iraq part Iran, except watchtowers occasional signposts, border largely unmarked, although local residents familiar boundaries. The witnesses, followed Western-looking hikers curiosity, say around 2 pm July 31, hikers descended mountain, uniformed guards NAJA, Iran's national police force, waved hikers toward Iranian side using "threatening" "menacing" gestures. When calls ignored, one officer fired round air. As hikers continued hesitate, guards walked yards Iraqi territory, lack jurisdiction, apprehended them. These witness accounts corroborate statement Bauer made May 20 tele-vised reunion Tehran hotel hikers mothers. As New York Times reported, Bauer "denied walked Iran, accused doing, stopping saying, 'We can't really talk that." Farhad Lohoni, local tribal leader, previously claimed American hikers snatched Iraq cross-border raid Iranian agents, reported Daily Telegraph August 2009. Lohoni said relatives seen group men cross border Iraq, told Telegraph hikers "were targeted captured group came Iran, ignoring Iraq's sovereignty. We know means Iran must wanted take Americans hostage sensitive time." A State Department spokesman said unaware evidence three arrested Iraqi territory would comment further. Once captured, Bauer, Fattal Shourd sped car local headquarters Iranian Revolutionary Guards Marivan, town close border province Kurdistan. When arrived, according two sources, Americans remanded custody Lt. Col. Heyva Taab, head Revolutionary Guards' intelligence unit region. According sources — former member Revolutionary Guards official serves provincial government Sanandaj — Taab would authority order Americans' detention eventual transfer Tehran. A branch Iranian military least 125,000 personnel, Revolutionary Guards responsible maintaining national security throughout Islamic Republic. "When I heard news arrested American hikers, I immediately thought, This work intelligence arm Revolutionary Guards, people region," says Idris Ahmedi, Iranian Kurdish exile regional expert visiting scholar Georgetown University. "I thought likely lured Iranian Kurdistan, could arrest them. It consistent Iran's past actions." Less month later, late August 2009, Taab arrested charged July 6 murder son Mostafa Shirzadi, Imam Joma (Friday prayer leader) Marivan, influential cleric region. Shirzadi's nephew also allegedly killed Taab. Since arrest Taab implicated vast criminal enterprise encompassing profitable smuggling operation dozens murders, rapes kidnappings. According Sanandaj official, numerous lawsuits, perhaps hundreds, filed Taab Kurdistan, alleging libel, theft, rape, kidnapping murder. Taab's case twice judge, awaits execution Tehran prison. Although state-run Iranian press reported Taab's crimes, made public series articles January February Kurdish news site, Kurdistan Va Kurdnews, run Kurdistan Democratic Party. A February 17 article describes Taab head "criminal band" reports Taab seven accomplices arrest Revolutionary Guards role vast number illegal killings. Several sources describe Taab central power Kurdistan province. According locals experts, control border lies hands Revolutionary Guards, particular intelligence unit, Etelaat Sepah, whose local division commanded Taab five years. "At point it's really Sepah, Revolutionary Guards, charge, especially western provinces, especially Americans side, Iraq," says Kaveh Ehsani, assistant professor international studies DePaul University Iran expert serves contributing editor journal Middle East Report. "On surface security force [NAJA] charge, really Revolutionary Guards control borders." It region where, according several Iran experts, smuggling cross-border traffic routine. The Iraq-Iran border "relatively porous it's mountainous," says Faraz Sanei, Iran researcher Human Rights Watch, issued report last year political freedom Iranian Kurdistan. Sanei describes border common escape route dissidents —journalists, human rights advocates Iranian Kurds—as well commonly used trade route goods. "Smuggling something taken place continues take place there, whether goods humans across border. It's something happens quite often." Soon Taab took charge Sepah northwestern quadrant Kurdistan, began enrich black-market border economy. According Sanandaj official former Revolutionary Guards officer, firsthand knowledge Taab's activities, Taab's first scheme involved selling merchandise confiscated petty smugglers, known koolbars, traffic consumer goods across border (a trade depicted Iranian film A Time Drunken Horses, won Camera d'Or Cannes 2000). The region also home variety Kurdish nationalist groups demanding autonomy central Tehran government. One these, Party Free Life Kurdistan (PJAK), affiliated Kurdistan Workers' Party, Kurdish separatist organization engages armed conflict within Turkey labeled terrorist organization United States governments. Since 2005 PJAK, based mountains Kurdish Iraq, open conflict Tehran claimed responsibility killing dozens Revolutionary Guards soldiers cross-border raids Iranian military bases, well February 2007 downing Iranian military helicopter shoulder-launched missile Khoy, Western Azerbaijan province, killed thirteen Iranian soldiers. It speculated Kurdish militants enjoy US support. In April 2006, Representative Dennis Kucinich wrote letter President Bush questioning whether US government "fomenting opposition supporting military operations Iran among insurgent groups Iranian ethnic minority groups, operating Iraq." Kucinich named two groups, including PJAK. In November year, Seymour Hersh reported The New Yorker "Israel United States also working together support Kurdish resistance group known Party Free Life Kurdistan," government consultant told Israeli government provided "equipment training" PJAK. The United States Israel denied involvement PJAK. Still, allegations support gained substantial traction inside Iran may undergirded Taab's decision detain Bauer, Fattal Shourd well repeated public charges espionage three. In early April, instance, Iranian Intelligence Minister Heydar Moslehi told Iran's Press TV "it quite obvious us three Americans arrested Iran last year links Western Israeli intelligence services." The Iranian government retaliated rising Kurdish militancy launching counteroffensive PJAK, inside Iran across border Iraq. In August 2007, example, Iranian soldiers crossed Iraq attacked several villages, McClatchy reported. Most recently, June 4, officials Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region alleged "a small unit Iranian soldiers," including tank several vehicles, penetrated mile Iraqi Kurdistan's Arbil province search Kurdish rebels. Until arrest, Taab key player Iran's counter- offensive. The former Revolutionary Guards officer says several current members Guards told Taab's stated goal "completely wipe PJAK" jurisdiction. According Alunedi, scholar Georgetown, Taab involved recent cross-border assassinations Iranian Kurds Iraqi Kurdistan. The Kurdish weekly Awena reported Taab unit assassinated two Kurds December 15, 2008. According former officer Sanandaj official, Taab's criminal enterprise grew beyond smuggling 2007, made first forays murder. Koolbars, petty border smugglers, often killed land mines fatally shot border police. So Taab concocted scheme kidnap koolbars well ordinary unemployed Iranian Kurdish civilians, dress uniforms PJAK insurgents kill them—claiming they'd died military clash—in order collect bounty, high $40,000 head, superiors Revolutionary Guards. He assisted plot least nine others, seven apprehended. The article Kurdistan Va Kurdnews named seven, including Haji Majid Muqimiyan Kermansha, identified ringleader. PJAK officially denied involvement border clashes, including May 3, 2009, post Iranian website Tabnak, published Mohsen Rezai, former head Revolutionary Guards. Many PJAK clashes may, fact, "bogus," said Sanandaj official. "More less clashes PJAK reported area since Heyva Taab gang busted." A mother one koolbar tearfully described son's disappearance. She said went missing day early 2009 government later claimed clash PJAK taken place. The woman, resident border town Iranian Kurdistan, plaintiff one lawsuits Taab; asked name location mentioned, fear would harm case court. Taab's scheme wildly successful, according Sanandaj official, said one bank account Taab's name nearly $6 million deposited since 2008. This macabre scheme ended spring 2009, Taab killed local official's brother seeking work area and, decisively, last July killed cleric's son. On June 11 Mohammad Javad Larijani, secretary general Iran's High Council Human Rights, said government's investigation nearly complete trial Bauer, Fattal Shourd "should far now." In statement issued June 17, mothers hikers called Iran either prosecute release children. "Iran legitimate reason stage release move forward fair trial children openly answer allegations them." "These new revelations, indeed true, show hikers victims political machinations manipulation," said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director International Campaign Human Rights Iran. "The fact held long without prosecution strongly supports trend. Under Iranian laws, committed crime released immediately. Their Iranian lawyer, studied judicial files them, consistently maintained charge illegal entry, subject fine arbitrary detention long. With new information, even charge appears fabricated, basis holding them." As press date, Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal Sarah Shourd detained Iran ten months twenty-three days.

But today, three Republican senators voted motion proceed Paycheck Fairness Act, bill "would strengthen current laws gender-based wage discrimination." The motion defeated vote 58-41, falling two votes short 60 needed bill considered Senate floor. This first time Paycheck Fairness Act stalled Senate. In 2008, upper chamber failed vote bill approved House, passed legislation 2009 support 10 Republicans. Women earn barely three-quarters male counterparts make work, conservatives invented number ludicrous reasons opposing equal pay legislation. For example, Heritage Foundation suggested equal pay laws actually hurt women businesses simply won't hire required pay fair wages. And Sen.

sbwhoeop Saturday, September 25, 2010 11:08 PM H: revenge old Labour. Sid 0 aptember 26, 2010 John Rentoul: The party voted David Miliband got Panda instead New Labour leader won't stand chance David Cameron The result worst possible Labour Party. A decisive victory Ed Miliband would one thing. The party would made wrong decision, would done eyes open leader's legitimacy unchallenged. Instead, Ed Miliband lost election two parts Labour's electoral college, among MPs among Labour Party members, won thanks 60-40 margin way among trade union members low turnout. If won clear margin I would said Labour chosen Panda leader. He soft, cuddly panders every oppositional instinct party. There position taken Labour government member prepared trash thought Labour members would like it. Tuition fees, Iraq, third runway Heathrow: name it, disowned it. Even, case third runway, policy direct ministerial responsibility. There part manifesto, wrote, prepared ditch. But party did. Labour Party members chose David Miliband. Labour MPs chose David. The party voted Ed Miliband tried dismiss "New Labour Establishment", words, supposedly hated Blairites. The party read signals voters correctly. It knows that, although didn't badly feared general election, lurch left answer. Party members MPs took board Tony Blair's warning Labour lost Gordon Brown "moved millimetre" left New Labour. They fall argument Labour better expected moving millimetre left and, therefore, better still needed move couple centimetres left. They think that, Labour pulled level opinion polls, next election bag. They know opposition party often moves ahead government opinion polls within months election. They also know Labour's poll rating artificially inflated absence fray Liberal Democrats protest party, know protest vote cannot relied upon general election. The Labour Party Labour MPs got right, election won operation run trade union machines. That means Ed Miliband, would struggled David Cameron House Commons event, going roasted every week. Every week, Prime Minister going point Leader Opposition support members benches behind him. Not that, support members party country. Every week, Cameron going portray Miliband place person trade union bosses beneficiary boss-politics stitch-up. If Ed Miliband won party members lost among MPs, I expected, Conservatives would teased Commons, would much legitimacy lain Duncan Smith - choice party activists wishes MPs. No wonder Ed "cork-popper" candidate Conservative HQ. The way things turned out, that's phrase; would worth lifting austerity ban bubbly for. David Cameron, lucky general, faces opponent less mandate IDS. Even Ed Miliband won comfortably three sections Labour's electoral college, I feel would struggled Cameron. This way, I fear fights hands tied behind back.

Diplomacy Before After Conflict By Marc Grossman Conflict universal condition,' older diplomacy. While conflict constant human history, nature armed conflict, especially nature 21st-century warfare, transformed. General Rupert Smith identified changes book The Utility Force: "The ends fight changing; fight amongst people; conflicts tend timeless; fight lose force; occasion new uses found old weapons; sides mostly non-state."2 The nature 21st-century diplomacy also changing. To successful, diplomats must simultaneously shape, act upon, react global challenges. As Hans Binnendijk Richard Kugler National Defense University argue, single problem, danger, threat holds key world's future. What matters interaction simultaneity responses.3 The definition victory, too, different today. Twenty-first-century national security success encompass comprehensive definition security, achieved broadest simultaneous application elements national power. This key understanding Philip Bobbitt's concept "preclusive victory," describes "anticipatory, precautionary attention possible futures," requiring expansive integrated approach modern diplomacy, defense, development. A diplomatic strategy designed produce preclusive victory include conflict prevention, successful negotiation, deterrence, preparation conflict else fail, efforts establish order, ensure stability, promote political economic pluralism conflict. Diplomats always participants prevention management conflict aftermath. The conflict prevention side diplomacy occupied much time State Department 1993 1997 Department's Executive Secretary U.S. Ambassador Turkey. Postconflict diplomacy defining issue last third career State Assistant Secretary State European Affairs Under Secretary State Political Affairs 2001 2005. I tried draw upon experiences observations discuss scope complexity modern diplomacy, methods goals needed prevent conflict, diplomacy's role conflict seems unavoidable, contribution diplomacy make restoring stability following conflict. Diplomacy Conflict Prevention Thanks efforts scholars practitioners, make better use methods theory conflict prevention. The United States Institute Peace Woodrow Wilson International Center Scholars two among many institutions taken leadership role efforts. Michael Lund, practitionerscholar, notes present uncoordinated patchy nature preventive diplomacy reflects absence accepted international conflict prevention regime system governance—that is, agreed upon arrangements geographic jurisdictions allocated, functional responsibilities assigned, norms procedures formulated, actors held accountable responsibilities.' He asks crucial question seek "coordinate rationalize" system preventive diplomacy: responsibility tasks preventive action located—early warning, decision act, formulation response, provision bureaucratic political support? Should horizontal, across different organizations actors, vertical, chains command?6 An example conflict prevention meets Lund's tests effort undertaken North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), close collaboration European Union (EU) Organisation Security Co-operation Europe, supported United States, avoid civil war Macedonia 2001. It difficult recall that, September 11, 2001, possibility civil war Macedonia leading international headline. This successful campaign conflict prevention defined remarkable personal institutional cooperation NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson EU High Representative Common Foreign Security Policy (and former NATO Secretary General) Javier Solana. I spoke often period Lord Robertson, Solana, Ambassador James Pardew, President George W. Bush Secretary Colin Powell appointed U.S. representative effort who, along Francois Leotard, EU Special Envoy, played crucial role negotiating implementing Ohrid Framework Agreement. As direct participant, senior NATO official Mark Laity stated insights modern diplomacy conflict prevention drawn effort, including need personal institutional teamwork, importance early engagement trying head violence, need choose right people tasks kind (including 21st-century diplomats act "unconventionally"), necessity able apply appropriate force quickly.' Diplomacy When Conflict Is Seems Be Unavoidable When diplomacy fails prevent conflict, role diplomat changes. The new requirement may justify use force efforts avoid conflict fail seek address underlying source conflict force seems inevitable imperative. The February 1999 diplomatic negotiations Rambouillet, France, designed show world NATO Contact Group willing make one last effort avoid using military force stop Slobodan Milosevic's attacks Kosovo. I Rambouillet Assistant Secretary State European Affairs support Secretary Madeleine Albright. After first day meeting, much chaos I urged Secretary Albright depart Rambouillet leave "negotiating" us junior. My strategy present, Secretary State— administration—could keep distance outcome might unacceptable United States. The Secretary different vision. Albright hoped Rambouillet would end brutality Kosovars, also prepared meeting fail, thereby options avoiding military conflict would exhausted. Her idea seen everything could diplomatically, including continued presence, Rambouillet failure, could excuses taking military action. Secretary State James Baker pursued similar strategy first Gulf War 1991. Baker relates memoirs, The Politics Diplomacy, President George H.W. Bush concluded United States offer meeting Washington Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz followed Baker trip Baghdad show America's commitment avoiding war possible. Baker writes thought proposal three merits: would give administration one last diplomatic opening avoid war; would shore domestic support conflict; would show that, deadline Iraq's withdrawal Kuwait neared, administration something preparing war. The President's offer turned famous meeting Baker Aziz January 9, 1991. As Baker recounts, "I illusions. I assumed talks would unsuccessful within matter days, would war."8 In 2001-2003, State Department leadership generally saw Iraq diversion Afghanistan central war terror. Saddam Hussein dictator menace— "in box," posing immediate, direct threat United States; focus kept defeating al Qaeda Afghanistan supporting new Afghan government.9 Iraq source tension disagreement inside State Department since beginning administration, sought move policy support "smart" United Nations (UN) sanctions toward aggressive posture Saddam. Secretary State Henry Kissinger wrote Years Upheaval second term Nixon administration State Department culture emphasizes negotiability, consciousness side accept.' Kissinger consider trait particular positive time, department's culture negotiability serve good guide institutional behavior senior State officials participated interagency debate leading invasion Iraq. If period surrounding 1970s détente Russia, diplomatic efforts Shah Iran, crisis Middle East resulting 1973 war, culture negotiability longer served good guide institutional behavior senior State officials participated interagency debate leading invasion Iraq. We took part planning conflict aftermath assuming—or hoping—that events either home abroad would turn preparations conflict successful coercive diplomacy rather military action ordered spring 2003. The State Department's Director Policy Planning, Richard Haass, observed "60:40 going war. . . organization could function people left every time lost 60:40 decision."' Haass operating belief Iraq weapons mass destruction; known not, says would 90:10 war. And senior Department State officer resigned protest. The department sought instead try recreate successful Gulf War coalition President George H.W. Bush argued United States allies might compel Saddam submit deployment force region early 2003. If failed, sustained diplomatic effort create broad coalition move militarily later 2003. This possibility broad international coalition lost relevance January 20, 2003, French government announced would never support second UN Security Council resolution authorize use force Iraq. Diplomacy Preparation Conflict Once conflict inevitable initiated, one job diplomats support military commanders getting need make conflict short possible, fewest casualties Americans, allies, civilians. This objective United States pursued Turkey first Gulf War, resulted President Turgut Ozal's support American efforts. The diplomatic effort prepare conflict Kosovo also involved whole U.S. Government governments NATO Allies. To pursue successful bombing campaign, diplomats many NATO countries arranged overflight support Allied forces. A similar effort U.S. diplomats took place invasion Afghanistan 2001. American allied diplomats worked closely nations surrounding Afghanistan, including forging contacts Central Asian states security issues first time order achieve transit, overflight, bed-down rights American coalition forces October 7, 2001, beginning action Afghanistan. Before invasion Iraq March 2003, especially January 20, 2003, similar effort began earnest. Diplomats supported U.S. Central Command commander General Tommy Franks order make war short successful possible limit American, allied, Iraqi civilian casualties. American diplomats worked military commanders seek access facilities U.S. forces participate public diplomacy effort gain much support possible armed liberation Iraq. American diplomats Pentagon officials paid particular attention Turkey effort convince Turks allow 4th Infantry Division transit country create northern front battle Saddam's forces. Although State Department worried size Department Defense (DOD) request Ankara, worked closely civilian military authorities Pentagon try meet need identified Chairman Joint Chiefs Staff. Joint DOD—State diplomacy, however, could overcome negative vote Turkish parliament, reflected strong public opposition war. The way debate using force carried inside government influences attitudes actions conflict well future decisions whether use force. Military force may restore security, cannot resolve political cultural sources conflict. As Rupert Smith writes, "We engaging conflict objectives lead resolution matter directly force arms, since basic tactical level objectives tend concern intentions people leaders rather territory forces."' Smith argues civil-military structure designed make political- military decisions "deeply problematic" distorts decisionmaking many ways.13 In book, Smith imagines debate British Foreign Commonwealth Office (FCO) Ministry Defense (MOD) officials address genocide taking place number weeks Rwanda summer 1994. FCO: What face events Rwanda? MOD: What want us do? FCO: We ought act. Something must done. We can't people massacred. As permanent member UN Security Council cannot seen nothing. MOD: So want us use military force? FCO: Yes. MOD: To what? To stop killing? FCO: Yes. Exactly. MOD: Who want us fight? We clear killing: tribe tribe, force found _from tribe? And Rwanda big country. Where start? Kigali, presumably, it's capital would want airhead. FCO: Well, must international force, course. MOD: And would British aim joining force? FCO: To play part permanent member UN Security Council. MOD: Is Britain lead force? FCO: No, led UN—a proper UN mission. MOD: That take time assemble, probably late stop killing. FCO: Then mission aimed bringing postconflict order. MOD: OK But need clear many British troops currently available. Given deployments Ireland, Bosnia places, many. FCO: What suggest? MOD: What government's priorities? Is contributing force higher priority tasks already undertaking? FCO: Probably not. MOD: In case, UN forces always lack expeditionary logistic support. And want speed deployment force, offering logistic unit would probably valuable contribution. FCO: Will put soldiers risk? MOD: Hardly any." Many American diplomats recognize imaginary conversation, participated something like dozens times since fall Berlin Wall. In American debate, issue also quickly focuses pays bills. It worth stating, least American case, officials Pentagon DOD often legitimately frustrated State Department's inclination promote military missions Pentagon Armed Forces increasing number situations important, vital, U.S. national interests. While readiness volunteer U.S. military forces solve problems around world direct result lack civilian capacity jobs required, leads understandable consternation among uniform. Diplomacy Restoring Stability Following Conflict There many issues—defeating extremism, promoting pluralism, bringing benefits globalization yet benefited, living sustainably planet, nonproliferation— part definition successful 21st-century diplomacy. But getting postconflict diplomacy right—creating conditions preclusive victory—may crucial all. This easy assignment. The concept success redefined fact, complicating assessment. Successful democratic governance economic development cannot delivered certain date, therefore need time patience necessity ground. However, patience limited home countries, "fatigue" often sets in. Thus, potential failure high. Industrial war produced winners losers; today's lines clearly drawn, timeline may longer. Rupert Smith brings clarity assessment: We intervene even decide escalate to, conflict order establish condition political objective achieved means ways. We seek create conceptual space diplomacy, economic incentives, political pressure measures create desired political outcome stability, possible democracy. . . . decisive strategic victory hallmark interstate industrial war, establishing condition may deemed hallmark new paradigm war amongst people.15 Smith's point pressed even recognizing additional distinction military operation carried following Smith's rules ambiguity inherent trying create conditions Smith identifies objectives. Christopher Schnaubelt noted typical military operation unambiguous geographic boundaries (areas responsibility) assign specific units responsible every inch ground cubic foot airspace. There obvious chain responsibilities expected actions individual Soldier Marine ground commanding general. Nothing comparable exists economic development governance tasks, tend assigned function rather local geography rigid hierarchy authority.16 Postconflict diplomacy among defining diplomatic issues last third career State Department. In aftermath first Gulf War 1991, almost 500,000 Kurds fled mountains Iraq Turkey. Stranded harsh conditions, began starve thousands day. I Deputy Chief Mission Turkey. Inspired leadership Ambassador Morton Abramowitz, American diplomats, followed American military forces international coalition governments nongovernmental organizations, initiated Operation Provide Comfort (which became Operation Northern Watch). This "whole-of-government" "whole-of-theinternational- community" campaign provide humanitarian assistance return Kurds homes Northern Iraq. Once home, needed protected, 11 years, United Sates allies, including Turkey, worked ground recreate functioning society protected area Saddam enforcing no-fly zone. These years also punctuated activity Balkans. As Richard Holbrooke recounts, pre-Dayton negotiations Bosnian leader Alija Izetbegovi took place residence I Ambassador Turkey:7 As one Holbrooke's successors Assistant Secretary European Affairs, I watched effort made Ambassadors Robert Gelbard James Dobbins implement Dayton Accords applying whole-of-government efforts postconflict post- Yugoslavia. I picked diplomatic thread Under Secretary State Political Affairs promoting reconciliation, development, political progress, nationbuilding Kosovo. Other postconflict diplomacy efforts Haiti, East Timor, Liberia called upon resources United States governments try create conceptual space development sustained peace. The U.S. effort Colombia, too, highlighted need focus integrated cross-sectoral approach, included disarmament, demobilization, reintegration former combatants promoted justice postconflict society. But main events modern diplomacy's postconflict paradigm Afghanistan Iraq. The key understanding U.S. diplomacy postconflict Afghanistan Iraq recall profound disagreement inside U.S. Government, especially DOD State, whether United States engage "nationbuilding," policy President Bush campaigned 2000. State Department professionals generally proud effort United States made nationbuilding peacekeeping, supporting deployment U.S. military forces participate, example, Multinational Force Observers Sinai peacekeeping nationbuilding activities East Timor, Haiti, Balkans. Most believed nationbuilding, properly funded executed, effective long-term tool integrated modern diplomacy United States. The effort create new Afghan government overthrow Taliban piece classical diplomacy carried 21st-century context.'8 Secretary Powell directed Ambassador Dobbins support regional negotiation hosted Germans Bonn 2001 create new Afghan government. To succeed, Dobbins worked key players, including representatives Iran, support major role United Nations put Hamid Karzai position lead new Afghanistan.' But, Dobbins written, "Bush Administration, overthrown Taliban installed new government Kabul, determined American troops would peacekeeping peacekeepers countries would allowed venture beyond Kabul city limits. Public security throughout rest country would left entirely Afghans, despite fact Afghanistan army police force."2° The struggle nationbuilding also hampered American attempts get sufficient amounts U.S. international assistance Afghanistan. Washington accepted diffusion responsibility there, British taking charge counternarcotics, Italians reforming justice sector, Germans training police. This satisfied need burden-sharing lead success. In addition, postconflict resources focused United States Afghanistan small compared recent postconflict situations, even including Kosovo.' American diplomats followed Dobbins Embassy Kabul years faced legacy lack attention underinvestment.22 The State Department participated many levels National Security Council—led planning postconflict Iraq. Much planning detailed, focused lessons learned first Gulf War. The department's Future Iraq Project, important, would solved Iraq's postwar problems. State capacity take responsibility immediate postconflict administration Iraq, leadership agreed Executive order creating postconflict Iraq structure reported Secretary Defense. There need recount lost lives lost opportunities well chronicled others immediate postconflict period Iraq, although Dobbins's argument that, looking back, Coalition Provisional Authority accomplished great deal trying circumstances worth noting.23 On July 1, 2004, State Department officially open (on time budget) Embassy Baghdad, allowed expansion diplomacy led comprehensive senior civilian-military cooperation. There another important lesson draw recent postconflict efforts: need adequate civilian capacity respond, including role revitalized U.S. Agency International Development (USAID). As journal chronicled article' Ambassador John Herbst, Secretary State's Coordinator Reconstruction Stabilization (S/CRS), office mandated develop whole-ofgovernment civilian response stability operations ensure civilian-military coordination. The Civilian Response Corps (CRC) early stage, ultimately made reserve component, addition existing active standby components. The personnel anticipated represent full range sector experts: engineers, lawyers, judges, corrections officials, diplomats, development experts, public administrators, public health officials, city planners, border control officials, economists, others. Currently, active standby components stepped drawn State, USAID, core group domestic U.S. Agencies. Once congressionally funded, reserves would drawn state local governments private sector. Between January 2008 May 2009, 56 CRC members deployed 11 countries, including Afghanistan planning purposes, realistic plans 250 active members 1,000 standby members ready deploy end 2010. There least 14 countries United States allies civilian peacebuilding capacity—some including stability civilian police, employing wholeof- government "comprehensive" approaches similar created Washington. Several, fact, higher budgets proportionate gross national products America's.25 One way State support S/CRS effort would consider creating new personnel specialty: "expeditionary diplomat." Washington's diplomatic personnel have, course, always one sense expeditionary; majority Foreign Service deployed abroad majority time. But post-9/11 diplomatic experience, especially effort Iraq Afghanistan, means State needs explicit expeditionary nature future diplomatic work prepare small significant number people serve successfully hardest places moment's notice. Experience Provincial Reconstruction Teams Iraq Afghanistan, lessons learned S/CRS, example diplomats pursued careers toughest posts lead State leadership conclude step worth taking. The first requirement would advanced training, provided DOD Central Intelligence Agency, entering diplomats believe want pursue special career path. These entering officers would make explicit choice understand investment extra training would require service hard places, ask diplomats take hardest languages— Chinese Arabic, example—to serve one tour using skills. Since expeditionary diplomats need meet age physical requirements special operations military, State Department could allow people opt "special force" careers long proper training. This would allow flexibility across institution encourage desire whose family circumstances might change time participate well. The department would also need make sure taking career path recognized career beyond norm Foreign Service promoted rewarded. The creation S/CRS symbol comprehensive, simultaneous diplomacy needed future, expeditionary diplomat could form backbone State USAID commitment civilian response capacity. There still key questions answered civilian capacity. In face real world situation, DOD really support State Department—led operation? Will Congress adequately fund S/CRS, including reasonable contingency fund? How S/CRS resurgent USAID work together? Where lines drawn immediate postconflict needs nationbuilding? There seems question path right one, consistent administration's focus diplomacy, development, defense. Success come clear direction active implementation. If combine observations made several authors,' arrive question: What national policies, supported adequate human financial resources, create conditions war bring preclusive victory? Nation building, post- conflict reconstruction stability operations, counterinsurgency strategy (call will) part modern diplomacy years come. Accomplishing task exclusively American responsibility, and, indeed, one goals modern American diplomats make efforts international. But foreseeable future, United States need learn lessons role nation building Germany Iraq." These lessons include support new institutions bring elements power influence together theater, time, close coordination United States allies friends chance succeed.28 As Philip Bobbitt written, "The problem picture warfare cling. This picture unfolds way: peace making diplomats; war making Armed Forces; peace building [US]AID reconstruction personnel. The reality 21st century warfare, however, tasks must performed simultaneously."' While challenges opportunities 21st century observed analyzed individually, none solved without reference others. Diplomacy answer every question, utility conflict. As General Smith writes end volume: For general purpose interventions clear: seek establish minds people leaders ever present option conflict preferable course action confrontation matter another. This applies much state possessing nuclear weapons seeking obtain them, rogue otherwise, * terrorist machete-wielding rebel; posing armed threat people establish condition achieve political goal. To this, military force valid option, lever intervention influence, much economic, political diplomatic levers, effective must applied apart greater scheme focusing measures one goal.3° The connection utility modern diplomacy clear. Twenty-first-century diplomacy, working prevent conflict, trying get ready inevitable, dealing consequences, effective tool national security adequately funded, carried well-trained, dedicated people, focused clear goals set national leaders, backed effective military force.

Jake probably passed you, case, I think it's definitely worth reading A comments one staff members long experience Middle East follow. From Martin: The principle conclusion quick visit Israel Ramallah weekend Netanyahu strong position politically, unusually stable ruling coalition. Nobody I spoke believed government would fallen decided extend settlement freeze expiry, gesture U.S. peacemaking efforts. In view, could easily garnered support large majority people, settlers marginal concern. And would given leverage ministers ensure support abstention cabinet. As Dan Meridor noted, Likud voters left Knesset members comes peacemaking (70 percent support two-state solution, vs 50 percent leadership). Lieberman, Likud, Bibi's chief concern. He wants keep government long possible fear leaves garner support right, including Likud, oppose peacemaking. For time being, Bibi uses threat alternative coalition Kadima keep Lieberman tent. But clock ticking. According Tzipi Livni, bring party government now, willing without demand "rotation," provided Bibi serious negotiating peace. But elections grow closer, party members turning idea joining government. They strengthened views recent internal polling shows Kadima 32 seats (up 28 now), Likud slightly 25, Labor 5. Therefore, Bibi intends make deal Abu Mazen, need sooner rather later. The longer waits, less leverage Lieberman likely Lieberman break away oppose next elections. In context, Bibi's negotiating tactics become self-defeating. Believing great negotiator, operating Middle East bazaar, inflates requirements well beyond anything reasonable belief best way secure highest price. The process bringing reasonable price uses lot energy, uses lot goodwill, humiliates Palestinian negotiating partner, raises doubts seriousness. In end, great pressure quarters, make final concession, wasting lot time, making everybody furious him, thereby securing credit either supporters negotiating partners. At heart, seems lack generosity spirit. This combines legendary fear seen "freier" (sucker) front people create real problem negotiations, especially holds cards. This complicated introduction notion "creative ideas." Thinking box, likes do, delay negotiations box already well-defined. To attempt broaden parameters generate mistrust intentions Palestinian side direct negotiations provide opportunity build trust. The reason dwelling Bibi's psychology rather politics latter point direction making deal: Israeli public ready get it; Israel doesn't make serious move, delegitimize standing internationally (something Bibi deeply concerned about); Bibi needs President Obama corner deal threat Iran avoid punishment voters mishandling relations U.S.; doesn't make deal Abu Mazen now, helped advance future concerned - llamas takeover Palestinian leadership. Yuval Diskin quite clear latter point. After praising Palestinian security services sky (unusual him) told warned Bibi moment high motivation prevent terror believe building state. If proves illusion, motivation disappear cannot guarantee security West Bank. He considers quite possible Bibi doesn't quickly demonstrate seriousness Abu Mazen, resign honor seriously damaged. He told Bibi cannot predict lead Palestinians Abu Mazen resigns, Salam Fayyad likely go too. What done? I magic solution must deeply frustrating exercise you. And please forgive I recommend repeating already know. 1.Put arm around Bibi: still thinks bring down. There substitute working him, even though makes frustrating process. But purpose embracing nudge forward, buy exaggerated political fears accept inflated demands. 2. Try find way make understand negotiating tactics counterproductive purposes. The Obama Administration done great deal lately underscore concern Israel's security, vote IAEA, sanctions Iran, letter Obama willing sign accepted Bibi's security requirements. That buy credibility him. 3. As friend, paint realistic picture strategic consequences negotiating tactics, particularly terms likely happen PA leadership worries politics Abu Mazen's politics. 4. If else fails, avoid recriminations favor "clarifying moment." The world course blame Bibi. But avoid kind finger-pointing favor repeated commitment negotiated solution willingness engage sides trying make happen, they're ready. The Israeli public American Jewish Community know far President prepared go allowed draw conclusions. Bibi, Abu Mazen, Arab states need negotiations time side them. They come back table sooner rather later long keep door open. From staffer: AM Anne-Marie Slaughter Director Policy Planning U.S. Department State (202) 647-2972

H: Les Gelb, oversaw writing Pentagon Papers, makes points Wikileaks show US today trying solve difficult international problems, telling truth diplomats acting professionally. Wiki Leaks Accidentally Helps U.S. Leslie H. Gelb November 30, 2010 I 10:42pm Julian Assange clearly intended State Dept. cable leaks smear U.S. evil selfish. Leslie H. Gelb inadvertently proved opposite. The Wikileakers dumped vast pile secrets prove United States selfish, stupid wicked—but revelations proved opposite. When remove gossip obvious trivia mesmerized press, clearly see Wikileakers never expected: A United States seriously professionally trying solve dangerous problems frighteningly complicated world, yet lacking power dictate solutions. U.S. policymakers diplomats shown, quite accurately, supposed do: ferreting critical information foreign leaders, searching paths common action, struggling right amount pressure apply allies adversaries. And cases, villain Washington, foreign leaders escaping common action cowardice hypocrisy. Don't think New York minute Julian Assange, Wikileaker, unloaded trove save humankind. Why toss cables Italy's leader rake Germany's chancellor cautious fuddy-duddy, President Hamid Karzai Afghanistan "paranoid"? To save world? Not chance. He get attention, got attention drooling press, went call material highlighting trivial. Did Assange leak critical conversations Chinese Arab leaders help solve problems Korea Iran? Not hair chinny chin chin. He show could it—and attention. Anyone hopeless left-wing ideologue knows leaks crush future serious conversations leaders time come. Just think: told someone serious critical confidence someone else, confidant went told others, would soon repeat mistake? Assange leak cables help solve world problems. These leaks absolutely gratuitous served purpose making media marvel. When actually read cables, here's see: American leaders American diplomats trying solve crucial world In explaining deed publicly, Assange suggests he's uncovering American misdeeds lies. His aim, says, inform citizens democracies peoples around world leaders really doing. Assange also insists transparency's sake. Yet got look inside, didn't see plain: diplomats good job. Indeed, turn nonsense stop listening strange commentary cable news even front pages great newspapers, actually read cables, here's see: American leaders American diplomats trying solve crucial world problems. But turn nonsense stop listening strange commentary cable news even front pages great newspapers, actually read cables, here's see: American leaders American diplomats trying solve crucial world problems. —Washington needs China's help bolstering sanctions Iran, China balks fear jeopardizing oil gas flow country. The Obama team arranges Saudi Arabia guarantee loss supply China. If world wants slow even prevent Iran's march nuclear weaponry, key path so. — The U.S. discovers North Korea manufactured new medium-range missiles trying deliver Iran China. The Obama team discovers this, informs Beijing, asks Beijing stop transfer. Beijing declines. Really creepy. — Yemen's leader takes public responsibility American missile attacks Al Qaeda Yemen. He wants diminish power terrorists, Americans others world. The "lie" Yemeni president harmless way get critical job done—that is, job fighting international terrorism. Wikileaks tears away political cover Yemen's leaders. —No country anywhere near much influence nutty North Korea China. So, U.S. diplomats searching desperately figure Chinese thinking North Korea order compose plan avoiding war Korean Peninsula. So, Wikileakers expose Chinese leaders actually trying give us insight Chinese thinking North Korean craziness. They won't soon. Time again, one actually reads cables, one heartened professionalism insights U.S. diplomats. What doing? They lying, U.S. leaders lying. They actually, believe not, trying solve problems. That seriousness purpose professionalism execute jumps materials. So, naïve say, it's good show effectiveness diplomats. Give break. Ask American diplomat choose looking intelligent leaked cables making progress toward avoiding war. None say leaks, press pursue classified information necessary helpful sensible public debate policy. If U.S. administration lying, distorting facts, telling one story public another itself, means, let's public. If U.S. government concocting intelligence order justify wars, let's hope enterprising reporter finds rest us. But Wikileaks dump providing essential information Americans others—information need serious policy discussion. This massive trashing Wikileaks legitimate effort U.S. government preserve confidentiality least shame most, crime. Leslie H.

sbwhoeop Friday, December 3, 2010 9:55 AM H: Roger Cohen NYT: "American Diplomacy Revealed — Good" http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/opinion/03iht-edcohen.html?hp December 2, 2010 American Diplomacy Revealed Good By ROGER COHEN NEW YORK — Let's hear men women U.S. Foreign Service! They are, judge WikiLeaks dump quarter-million private secret cables, thoughtful, well-informed dedicated servants American interest write clear, declarative English sentences. I've heard much torrent Wiki-chatter admirable career diplomats whose diplomacy condemned unquiet. Yet whose lives upturned. Every journalist knows correspondence several years suddenly made public, would lose sources. That give every journalist pause. So front line U.S. diplomacy. Contacts self-censor. They go quiet, particularly conspiratorial parts world also tend unstable, like Middle East. Layers secrecy added. Julian Assange, thin-skinned founder WikiLeaks, hurt U.S. interests across broad probably shallow spectrum. That satisfy he's self-styled foe United States. The guy makes queasy. Perhaps shocking thing Assange treasure trove — beyond "shock" venal Gulf Arab Sunni leaders looking war cheap Shiite Iran long doesn't disrupt U.S.-armed fiefdoms; "shock" Pakistani double-dealing nuclear procrastination; "shock" yet premature Israeli predictions Iran nuclear weapon; "shock" continued Saudi funding Al Qaeda; "shock" Chinese Politburo hacking Google; "shock" Muammar el-Qaddafi's taste voluptuous Slavic women Silvio Berlusconi's taste women — perhaps biggest shock professional, sober short embarrassment cables much conform world already knew it, right familiar adjectives evoking French President Nicolas Sarkozy: "hyperactive," "mercurial," "authoritarian," "erratic," "monarch-like." I swear, hadn't become diplomats lot State Department people could become good hacks. Overall, longstanding admiration America's conscientious diplomats redoubled, least underreported nugget turbulent Iranian election 2009, contained cable Jan. 12, 2010, Dubai: "While don't know might ever know real June 12 vote count, clear turnout record high levels systematic vote count fraud (if fact votes even counted) ensure Ahmadinejad 'won big' first round." It good know innermost conviction American diplomacy: fraud evident anyone Tehran election violent aftermath. A couple observations Iran: The first Sunni autocrats Gulf exercised Tehran part know U.S.-Iranian breakthrough might make dispensable United States. Their vested interest prevailing Middle Eastern strategic equation strong; nothing would redraw Middle East overcoming U.S.-Iranian psychosis. The second President Barack Obama's approach Iran much conventional initial outreach suggested. Old habits attempted coercion trumped originality. Very quickly fell back Dennis Ross's tired thinking balancing "appetizing carrots" "sharp sticks" tackling Iran's nuclear program. The cables reveal early March 2009, senior U.S. diplomat talking "dual track," telling Europeans "engagement alone unlikely succeed" calling added "pressure." Perhaps Iranian skepticism could never overcome; certainly approach guaranteed longstanding Iranian grievances would fester. Assange clearly understands nothing Iran Middle East diplomacy. In interview Time, expressed approval Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "coming interesting statement leaders speak public like private whenever can" bought Netanyahu's view this, Assange's words, would "lead kind increase peace process Middle East particularly relation Iran. It Huh? Netanyahu referring Arab leaders' now-documented private calls U.S.-led war Iran, option also favors. And that, Assange, step forward peace! He's place. What make brainy naïf told colleague John Burns America threat democracy? He's loose canon; let be. My impression he's self-armed spade he's digging. And messenger's message? The cables intriguing, offering plenty voyeuristic titillation gasp discovery. They provide texture break little new ground. Yet publication done significant damage courageous work America's diplomats may endanger lives. That's tradeoff I find troubling unpersuasive.

sbwhoeop Saturday, December 4, 2010 7:08 PM H: Kathleen Palin JFK. Sid B6 Sarah Palin wrong John F. Kennedy, religion politics By Kathleen Kennedy Townsend Friday, December 3, 2010; 6:00 PM Sarah Palin found new opponent debate: John F. Kennedy. In new book, "America Heart," Palin objects uncle's famous 1960 speech Greater Houston Ministerial Association, challenged ministers - country - judge him, Catholic presidential candidate, views rather faith. "Contrary common newspaper usage, I Catholic candidate president," Kennedy said. "I Democratic Party's candidate president happens also Catholic." Palin writes growing up, taught Kennedy's speech "succeeded best possible way: It reconciled public service religion without compromising either." Now, however, says revisited speech changed mind. She finds "defensive . . . tone content" upset Kennedy, rather presenting reconciliation private faith public role, instead offered "unequivocal divorce two." Palin's argument seems challenge great American tradition, enshrined Constitution, stipulating religious test public office. A careful reading book leads conclude Palin wishes precisely test. And seems think she, think like her, qualified judge would pass would not. If religious test, need candidate's religious affiliation "reconciled." My uncle urged religion private, removed politics, feared making faith arena public contention would lead American politics ill-disguised religious warfare, candidates tempted use faith manipulate voters demean opponents. Kennedy cited Thomas Jefferson argue that. part American tradition, essential keep semblance religious test political realm. Best judge candidates public records, positions war peace, jobs, poverty, health care. No one, Kennedy pointed out, asked died Alamo church belonged to. But Palin insists evaluating acting authority candidates' faith. She faults Kennedy "telling country faith enriched him." With line, proceeds path fraught danger - precisely path uncle warned said president's religious views "neither imposed upon nation imposed nation upon condition holding office." After all, candidate's faith matter believe right serve arbiters faith. Is worthy? Is deep? Is reflected certain ideology? Palin criticizes Kennedy because, "rather spelling faith groups provided life-changing services education millions Americans, repeatedly objected government assistance religious schools." She seem appreciate Kennedy courageous arguing government funds used parochial schools, despite temptation please constituents. Many Catholics would liked money. But wisely thought use public dollars places nuns explicitly proselytized would unconstitutional. Tax money used persuade someone join religion. As contrast Kennedy's speech, Palin cites former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney's remarks 2008 Republican primary campaign, spoke publicly "how faith would inform presidency, I elected." After paying lip service separation church state, Romney condemned unnamed enemies "intent establishing new religion America - religion secularism." "There one fundamental question I often asked," Romney said. "What I believe Jesus Christ?" Romney, course, Mormon. He answered question, proclaiming "Jesus Christ son God." Palin praises Romney delivering "thoughtful speech eloquently correctly described role faith American public life." But religious test politics, candidate feel compelled respond misplaced questions belief Jesus? When George Romney, Mitt Romney's father, presidential candidate 1968, felt compulsion. Respect Constitution founders' belief separation church state suggests kinds questions play role political campaigns. Palin contends Kennedy sought "run away religion." The truth uncle knew quite well made America special revolutionary assertion freedom religion. No nation Earth ever framed law faith interest government officials. For centuries, European authorities murdered tortured whose religious beliefs differed own. To demand citizens display religious beliefs attacks foundation nation undermines precise reason America exceptional. Palin's book makes clear dangerous proposed path be. Not want people reveal beliefs, wants sit judgment views don't match own. For instance, criticizes Rep. Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), Democrat faithful Catholic, "talking (God) talk walking walk." Who Palin say God's "walk" is? Who anointed grand inquisitor? This woman also praises Abraham Lincoln's Second Inaugural, even though Lincoln explicitly declared, "But let us judge judged." The problem setting free-floating tribunal evaluate faith that, contrary Lincoln, installing judges look others' souls assess worthiness. Kennedy would that, indifferent faith. In fact, unlike Romney Palin, fealty faith Constitution, promised day Houston would resign religion ever interfered duty president. My uncle man faith tested. His brother brother-in-law killed World War II, sister died plane crash soon war. He suffered painful injuries inflicted Navy service PT boat cut two Japanese destroyer. His God make life easy require commitment justice. America's first oniy Catholic president referred God three times p_;.-: .:1,rai.adc'res invoked Bible's command care poor sick. Later presidency, 1.-.a ur;:•:-.1uvocaliv. riohi:s: We confronted primarily moral issue. It old Scriptures clear American Constitution." Faith runs deep current family. Faith inspired uncles' father's dedication justice. My father, Robert F. Kennedy, returning apartheid-era South Africa 1966, wrote magazine article titled "Suppose God Is - Black." And uncle Teddy fought health care Americans, even book }Dalin presumes judge took positions "directly odds Catholic faith." Teddy Kennedy believed stands one faith. He disagree Roman Catholic hierarchy times. But seen, hierarchy's positions change, church, obligation help bring changes. That may Palin's theology, glory America support would disagree - even difficult personal matters, religion. John F. Kennedy knew tearing wall separating church state would tempt us toward self-righteousness contempt others. That one reason delivered Houston speech. Palin, part, argues "morality cannot sustained without support religious beliefs." That statement amounts wholesale attack countless Americans, study reasonable argument I seen heard would support blanket condemnation. For person claims admire Lincoln, Palin curiously ignores injunction Americans, even engaged Civil War, show "malice toward none, charity ail." Pal fails understand genius nation. The United States one vibrant religious countries Earth precisely religious freedom. When power faith entwined, faith loses. Power tends obfuscate, corrupt focus temporal rather eternal purposes. Somehow Palin misses this. Perhaps didn't read full Houston speech; certainly doesn't know heart. Or may appealing religious right really seeks secular power. I don't know. I certain, however, American political leader cavalierly - political calculation - dismiss hard- won ideal religious freedom among country's greatest gifts world. As John F. Kennedy said Houston, "kind America I believe in."

Last year, friend mine invited Hanukkah party Obamas gave prominent Jews (a group tensions), Obamas descended grand stairway, stood foyer briefly; President made remarks shook hands, back stairs went. No mingling. In first two years, Obamas seemed bit tone-deaf: many vacations people hurting, especially Michelle's extravagant trip Spain. (I'm interested Michelle's clothes next woman time think staff focused looking smashing, does. Her wardrobe seems quite extensive troubled times.) Barack Obama's personality much mulled past two years, seems inescapable high self- esteem often slides thin line arrogance, trickles (with exceptions) much staff, downright rude chosen few. °barna seemed uninterested anyone immediate group, three four members immediate circle--Jarrett, Robert Gibbs, David Axelrod—had experience governing. The fourth, Rahm Emanuel, expressed flippancy, arrogance, overuse F-word offended members Congress also would-be allies President. Vice President Joe Bider), liked Capitol Hill, virtually shut dealings people Congress first two years—"I handle them," Obama told Biden—but Biden expected given larger role part White House's new determination "reach out." (A months ago highly placed members staff also swore would "reach out," seemed last days.) One oddest aspects Obama's persona someone seems confident insisted thus far people around said "comfortable." For example, Torn Donilon, recently appointed national security adviser (a promotion role deputy), accounts capable man one's idea serious strategic thinker. The explanation I given Donilon's given new position "the President comfortable him." Just Obama described pleased himself, treated hero worship much staff. After all, taken formidable Clintons, and, expectation almost pundits experts, beaten them. Why listen doubted him? A common complaint Obama White House first two years "grown-ups" around, people knew governing would tell Obama wrong. When people tried suggest someone brought in, person rejected "not one ours." Joe Biden said argue Obama issues, Afghanistan, get management White House.... Those supported Obama 2008 expected able move public opinion, get people follow him. The fact Obama White House poor "messaging" baffles even strongest supporters. In fact, overall message. As Winston Churchill put it, theme pudding. When I asked White House aide this, pointed billed "major speech economy," Georgetown University April 2009. But speech utterly forgettable—and forgotten. One ally attributes problem inexperience Obama top staff. An ally says, "You can't leave message don't strategy don't know you're going." Another says, "They something worked campaign didn't work White House." Thus, Obama didn't see need explain doing. His 2010 campaign themes seemed wander place: Stanley Greenberg, pollster former aide Bill Clinton, said Obama's oft-used theme, shouldn't go back Bush days, actually tested negatively, people didn't believe country making economic, progress. So Obama's biggest failure leader many expected be. The jubilation surrounded swearing-in may gone head, celebrants overlooked plenty people overjoyed advent black president, even Democrat. Obama was, apparently estimation, smart adored seems felt need explain—and explain again—to country take country along him. This failure put programs across came times 2010 campaign.... More once, people town hall meetings told behind great trouble trying defend explain agenda. In backyard gathering October 21 made awkward reply I heard: "Our attitude get policies right didn't always think making sure got advertising properly going on." Advertising. (When I mentioned Democratic senator generally supportive Obama, ordinarily polite man responded, "Bullocks! What policies?") The risk-averse Obama left Congress write big bills economic stimulus health care (with strong participation White House aides). But kept line defense way pathetic press conference day election.

The effort presents host conflict-of-interest questions mayor. The new venture provides mayor yet another potent communications apparatus — one carries name imprimatur — sound issues collide job mayor, corporate interests expanding philanthropic empire. Bloomberg L.P. executives said would shy away publishing editorials issues Mr. Bloomberg direct interest mayor, like education, public health environmental policy. Mr. Winkler said editorials would avoid issues would disclose mayor's involvement warranted. Though Mr. Bloomberg hand conceiving writing editorials, likely offer feedback time time published, Mr. Winkler said.

THE NBC/YORKER December 14, 2010 The Envoy Posted Hendrik Hertzberg Last night, I unlocking bike windswept Greenwich Village sidewalk leaving holiday party, friend approached, cell phone hand. A minutes earlier, I inside, chatting happily amid buzz warmth holiday party. Now tears eyes. "Richard Holbrooke died," said. Notwithstanding hospital bulletins since fell ill Saturday—critical condition, damaged aorta, emergency surgery—this sudden, awful ending shock, Richard Holbrooke astounding volcano vitality. Everything large: physical size, including ultimate "in face" face, face like Times Square billboard; buzz-saw voice, highly expressive instrument, equally adept piano (a side-of-the-mouth, gossipy wisecrack, often pleasingly nasty) forte (a high-decibel outburst anger indignation, almost always calculated effect); appetites (for experience, danger, praise, power, fun); ambitions (for himself, beliefs, United States, world). He doe-eyed peacenik, diplomat labored long hard seek alternatives war ways end particular wars. He sentimental unsentimentality, romantic tough-guy realism. Unlike tearful informant, known Holbrooke family friend since little girl, I acquainted casual way many journalists editors. He peer well "source," prolific forceful writer whose favorite venues, The New Republic The New Yorker, happened places I've spent working life. He gregarious fond big, splashy black-tie evenings. The last time I saw six weeks ago, November 1st, New York Public Library's "Literary Lions" celebration. At pre-dinner reception, would normally feet, looming large, repaired folding chair behind little table let wife, Kati Marton, bring party him. At sixty-nine tired—that much obvious—but sharp voluble ever. He still plenty do. Not long Holbrooke achieved greatest diplomatic triumph negotiating 1995 end Balkan wars, I asked liked Warren Zevon's wonderful song "The Envoy." He said he'd never heard it. The next day I sent CD. After that, mentioned every single time I've seen him, including NYPL gala, saying puts on, loud, needs lift. And wonder: life drama, liked way. If Supreme Court allowed votes counted 2000, Envoy, almost certainly, would become Secretary State, next decade would unfolded differently. As is, Holbrooke left stronger, positive, creative mark history held post. He certainly die broken heart—Kati Marton saw that—but surely ghastly, impossible demands last, impossible assignment brought rending aorta. He died country surely soldier. And deathbed words may turn important ever spoke.
