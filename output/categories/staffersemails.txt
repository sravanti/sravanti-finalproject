Now chance support new beginning Muslim world — new beginning accountable governments provide services opportunities citizens ways could dramatically decrease support terrorist groups violent extremism. It's hard imagine something strategic interest. It counter-productive. Many thoughtful commentators, including Al Jazeera's director general, Wadah Khanfar, argue important Arab spring coming Arabs themselves. From perspective, Western military intervention play right Qaddati's hands, allowing broadcast pictures Western bombs falling Arab civilians. But arguments, important, must weighed appeals Libyan opposition fighters asking international help, now, astonishingly, support no-flight zone governments kept populations quiescent holding specter foreign intervention. Assuming no-flight zone imposed international coalition includes Arab states, opportunity establish new narrative Western support Arab democrats.

This it. Pretty uncompelling piece ask me, course I'm biased. Mitt Romney: A New Course Middle East Restore three sinews American influence: economic strength, military strength strength values. Disturbing developments sweeping across greater Middle East. In Syria, tens thousands innocent people slaughtered. In Egypt, Muslim Brotherhood come power, country's peace treaty Israel hangs In balance. In Libya, ambassador murdered In terrorist attack. U.S. embassies throughout region stormed violent protests. And Iran, ayatollahs continue move full tilt toward nuclear-weapons capability, promising annihilate Israel. These developments not, President Obama says, mere "bumps road." They major issues put security risk. Yet amid upheaval, country seems mercy events rather shaping them. We're moving direction protects people allies. And that's dangerous. If Middle East descends chaos, Iran moves toward nuclear breakout, Israel's security compromised, America could pulled maelstrom. We still time address threats, require new strategy toward Middle East The first step understand got here. Since World War II, America leader Free World. We're unique earned role conquest promoting human rights, free markets rule law. We ally like-minded countries, expand prosperity trade keep peace maintaining military second none. But recent years, President Obama allowed leadership atrophy. Our economy stuck "recovery" barely deserves name. Our national debt risen record levels. Our military, tested decade war, facing devastating cuts thanks budgetary games played White House. Finally, values misapplied—and misunderstood—by president thinks weakness win favor adversaries. By failing maintain elements influence stepping away allies, President Obama heightened prospect conflict instability. He understand American policy lacks resolve provoke aggression encourage disorder. The Middle East case point. The Arab Spring presented opportunity help move millions people oppression freedom. But also presented grave risks. We needed strategy success, president offered none. And seeks downplay significance calamities past weeks The incomprehension afflicts president's policy toward Israel. The president began term explicit policy creating "daylight" two countries. He recently downgraded Israel "closest ally" Middle East "one closest allies." It's diplomatic message received clearly Israel adversaries alike. He dismissed Israel's concerns Iran mere "noise" prefers "block out." And time Israel needs America stand it, declined meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In period uncertainty, need apply coherent strategy supporting partners Middle East—that is, governments individuals share values. This means restoring credibility Iran. When say Iranian nuclear-weapons capability—and regional instability comes it--is unacceptable, ayatollahs must made believe us. It means placing daylight United States Israel, And means using full spectrum soft power encourage liberty opportunity long known corruption oppression. The dignity work ability steer course lives best alternatives extremism. But Middle East policy undermined unless restore three sinews influence: economic strength, military strength strength Of values. That require different set policies President Obama pursuing.

In unprecedented show public anger Libya's rampant militias, crowd overwhelmed compound Ansar Al-Sharlah Brigade center eastern city Benghazi. Ansar Al-Shariah fighters initially fired air disperse crowd, eventually abandoned site weapons vehicles overrun waves protesters shouting "No militias." "I don't want see armed men wearing Afghani-style clothes stopping street give orders, I want see people uniform," said Omar Mohammed, university student took part takeover site, protesters said done support army police.

For many Libyans, Sept. 11 attack U.S. Consulate Benghazi last straw one biggest problems Libya faced since ouster death longtime dictator Moamrnar Qaddafi around year ago -- multiple mini-armies arsenals machine guns rocket-propelled grenades stronger regular armed forces police. The militias, legacy rag-tag popular forces fought Qaddafi's regime, tout protectors Libya's revolution, providing security police cannot. But many say act like gangs, detaining intimidating rivals carrying killings. Militias made Islamic radicals like Ansar Al-Shariah notorious attacks Muslims don't abide hardline ideology. Officials witnesses say fighters Ansar Al-Shariati led attack U.S. consulate, killed Amb. Chris Stevens three Americans. After taking Ansar compound, protesters drove attack Benghazi headquarters another Islamist militia, Rafallah Sahati. The militiamen opened fire protesters, largely unarmed.

The march biggest seen Benghazi, Libya's second largest city home 1 million people, since fall Qaddafi August 2011. The public backlash comes part frustration interim government, unable rein armed factions. Many say officials' attempts co-opt fighters paying fueled growth militias without bringing state control integrating regular forces.

"The killing ambassador blew situation. It disastrous," said Ayoub al-Shedwi, young bearded Muslim preacher Darna says received multiple death threats spoken militias radio show hosts. "We felt revolution going vain." Leaders tribes, strongest social force eastern Libya, come forward demand militias disband. Tribal leaders Benghazi Darna announced week members tribes militiamen longer protection face anti-militia protests. That means tribe avenge killed.

When first came office, Obama seemed suspicious Petraeus, made reputation President George W. Bush general transformed military's approach Iraq war. The suspicion reflected fraught National Security Council debate Afghanistan strategy 2009. Yet since then, Obama, like many others, seems seduced Petraeus. Not man man could offer him. Petraeuss unique political genius last decade provide two contrasting presidents military solution key national security problems tailored character. For Bush, obsessed Iraq leaving mark Middle East, Petraeus helped design grandiose, troop-heavy approach.

But approach, though cheaper resources American lives, still flawed. It still military answer problems deeply political nature rooted complex mix history, regional cultural particularism, effects protracted abuse power elites. By shifting drones special ops instruments choice combat militant extremism, U.S. government remains consumed old questions: How many men women uniform, equipped kind hardware, need employ tactics defeat enemy? What atrophied years two U.S. administrations dwelt obsessively questions tools U.S. foreign policy, including information-gathering analysis, diplomacy economic legal leverage. Perhaps gravest consequence knowledge deficit. Both wars hampered devastating lack situational understanding. In Afghanistan, I lived worked eight years, I stunned long took U.S. officials realize tribes key Afghan social structure. U.S. officials resisted meeting ordinary Afghans, dealing instead members self-serving unpopular government. So, decade, U.S. government operating almost blind. The first way Obama constructively harness Petraeus downfall reorient CIA toward core function: intelligence-gathering. Of late, body-count culture prevailed CIA, exemplified secretive drone campaign. If 60 intelligence professionals assigned planning monitoring drone air, reported, that's 60 ground country, interacting locals, gaining intuitive feel dynamics. Obama resist temptation put another target-focused operator helm CIA. Another main civilian component U.S. power diplomacy. Obama also use moment transition think kind State Department really needs. The instruments U.S. foreign policy multiple, varied subtle application. To avail them, government needs smart, adaptable, dynamic risk-takers, think strategically operate autonomy. Such people must attracted government service provided responsibilities commensurate talents. But national security topic moment threatens push Obama wrong direction. The death Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens Benghazi, Libya, politicized deeply counterproductive ways. Members Congress bear mind continue examining details attack. Stevens exactly type diplomat U.S. government needs: someone long experience region posted, ambassador engaged people, gained insight environment helped influence it. That kind diplomacy essential, carries risks. If becomes politically untenable Washington ambassador die line duty, talented diplomats hobbled. And faced choked career path, best look elsewhere rewarding work. Obama appoint secretary State determined counteract tendency retrench.

When us people faith - I one — feel pain insults, misunderstanding, denigration cherish, must expect others resort violence, That universal standard expectation, everyone's obligation meet that, make differences, expect less expect others, You cannot respond offensive speech violence without begetting violence. And I strongly believe great religions world stronger insults. They withstood offense centuries. Refraining violence, then, sign weakness one's faith; absolutely opposite, sign one's faith unshakable. So tonight, must come together recommit working toward future marked understanding acceptance rather distrust, hatred, fear. We pledge whenever one person speaks ignorance bigotry, ten voices answer. They answer resoundingly offense insult, answering ignorance enlightenment, answering hatred understanding, answering darkness light; one person commits violent act name religion, millions stand condemn strength. In times like these, easy despair differences irreconcilable, mountains steep climb; therefore never reach level understanding peacefulness seek, I believe great religions world call us pursue. But that's I believe, I don't think it's believe either tonight. Part makes country special keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing future. We keep supporting next generation, believing young people keep us moving forward positive direction. So tonight I think it's important talk better tomorrow seek, also things — real, practical, tangible things — young people help shape better future.

It McCain first leveled solemn charge Rice lied Sunday TV shows attack U.S. consulate Benghazi, Libya. She characterized spontaneous riot was, fact, planned attack local al-Qaeda affiliate. But Rice hewing early line established intelligence community. If CIA others wrong - deceptive - so, inevitably, she. Just surely day follows night, McCain's broadside echoed Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). It soon taken 97 Republicans House found Rice unqualified become secretary state - post nominated. "Ambassador Rice widely viewed willfully incompetently misled American public," bellowed. I think Rice would make dandy secretary state. She's close president, matters great deal. But also seen overly political that, much version Benghazi, troubles others. Oddly enough, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), former presidential candidate another potential secretary state, seen much statesmen.

Hillary Clinton Embraces New Media By MATTHEW LEE AP Sat, Mar 21, 2009 WASHINGTON (AP) — Her videos aren't quite viral yet she's tweeting, Secretary State Hillary Rodham Clinton embracing new media, using Web promote agency role nation's top envoy. In less three months, Clinton's State Department embarked digital diplomacy drive aimed spreading word American foreign policy restoring Washington's image. Part broader Internet outreach President Barack Obama's administration, Clinton's Web efforts already outpaced predecessors. Since taking Foggy Bottom, Clinton's team built e-diplomacy innovations developed George W. Bush's presidency: - They revamped department's Web site (http://www.state.gov) Dipnote blog (http://blogs.state.gov http://twitter.com/dipnote) fresh array features, graphics colorful posts. - Users track foreign travel interactive map (http://www.state.gov/secretary/trvI/map/?trip_id5) - They keep virtually every move Facebook, Twitter, Flickr YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/user/statevideo). - They pose questions "ask-the-secretary" column (http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/ask/secretary/117297.htm) recently revised "text secretary." (http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/ask/secretary/120236.htm) "New media critical new era diplomacy, smart power expanded dialogues essential achieving foreign policy goals," said Cheryl Mills, Clinton's longtime confidante chief staff. Even government Web site, early indications show surge interest, according internal State Department statistics provided The Associated Press. Daily views Dipnote doubled 10,000 year ago 20,000 today, 700 subscribers RSS feed, twice many March 2008. The number followers department Twitter tripled since Jan. 20, Obama took office, department's Facebook friends increased 2 1/2 times period. 8 "What bringing willingness experiment," said Peter Daou, Clinton's Web guru 2008 presidential run. "They starting push envelope." What remains unclear, though, whether spike interest reflects revamped Web site public's fascination Clinton's latest career shift. "The personality behind can't dismissed," said Daou, blogs human rights issues U.N. Dispatch (http://www.undispatch.com). Like Obama, Clinton carries Blackberry, allowed use department's secure seventh floor office is. Aides say takes active role answering questions Web, responding bloggers pushing agency's new media agenda. "The United States Government behind nearly everybody, except certain discrete areas, terms technology," told department employees town hall meeting February. "We are, view, wasting time, wasting money, wasting opportunities, prepared communicate effectively business world private world." Clinton quick embrace new media start presidential campaign. She announced entry race February 2007 Web followed regular Internet chats Internet fundraising appeals. Nonetheless, Clinton surpassed Obama campaign's mastery Internet social networking sites. Obama used Web raise record donations identify orchestrate army volunteers. Clinton first lady first White House Web site debuted 1994. It bare-bones operation compared available now. Three years later, State Department went online Secretary State Madeleine Albright's tenure. But wasn't 2007, Secretary State Condoleezza Rice's spokesman, Sean McCormack, department's public affairs shop began exploring new media earnest. McCormack started Dipnote blog, foreign service veterans predicted would fail, given private stuffy nature diplomacy. The site endured Rice. Clinton retooled Dipnote Twitter feed broader range posts diplomats. It's window dressing. This past week, diplomats used Twitter "tweet" false rumors feared might lead siege U.S. Embassy Madagascar. On first two foreign trips, Asia Middle East Europe, local bloggers "embedded" traveling press corps, broadening audience Clinton's official meetings public appearances, often produce personal policy questions. On question site, Clinton responded varied questions, "Should U.S. engage direct dialogue Hamas?" "How like meeting Japanese students?" By end Clinton's trip Mideast, "text secretary" feature received nearly 2,000 text messages. On trips, Clinton also participated Webcasts. One Beijing climate change generated 10.2 million page views, 50,000 comments 7,000 questions, according statistics.

April 11, 2009 12pm Word count: 2,392 (19 min) Rooney (x7-7203, 202-431-6498) SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON REMARKS TO THE HAITI DONORS CONFERENCE Washington, D.C. Tuesday, April 14, 2009 For us, Haiti neighbor. For others, place historic cultural ties. For us, test collective commitment resolve. Some may ask small nation middle Caribbean Sea command attention today. Why countries Western Hemisphere, Europe, Middle East Asia offer assistance Haiti midst global economic downturn shaken us all. We're gathered conference happens Haiti resound far beyond Caribbean beyond Americas. The success failure one small nation economic, social political implications, 9 million citizens, region whose future shaped strength commitment achieve economic recovery, political progress wider opportunity people Portland Porto Alegre Port-au-Prince. The United States here, first foremost, right thing neighbor friend. Our ties Haiti reach back early years nations endured generations-through struggles independence; defeat slavery Haiti, inspired slaves abolitionists U.S. press fight freedom; recently, hundreds thousands Haitians emigrated United States strengthened contributions politics, business, science, sports culture-the benefits I experienced firsthand senator representing New York. We also committed creating hemisphere every nation-no matter present level wealth current political circumstances-is moving direction, toward greater peace, prosperity, freedom opportunity. With Haiti, chance global cooperation collaboration stand solidarity people seeking march forward. A nation small investments assistance countries beginning reap dividends economic growth, wider access health care, stronger governmental institutions, greater safety security-and higher quality life results material conditions people's lives improve. Today, Haiti poorest nation hemisphere, one region's biggest gaps haves have- nots. But 2006, Haiti highest economic growth since 1990s. It track reach completion point IMF's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative next months, means significant debt relief way, free approximately $4 million month-money Haiti invest directly improving lives people building future self-sufficiency confidence. Haiti region's highest rate HIV/AIDS, highest rate maternal mortality, highest rate child mortality. But numbers HIV infections child maternal deaths coming down. Not long ago, Haiti endured three decades brutal dictatorship. But national presidential elections 2006 jump-started Haiti's democracy, President Preval Prime Minister Pierre Louis seeking maintain strong commitment democratic governance, take another step forward Sunday elections Senate. Like many nations, including United States, Haiti struggles crime, particularly global scourge drug trafficking. But reforms improve policing, strengthen justice system fight corruption underway, peacekeeping force led Brazil helped bring stability many Haitian communities. Haiti made strides help citizens many nations institutions represented today. And progress come government-to-government partnerships, also links among businesses, universities, NG0s, religious cultural groups, individuals-the full range resources relationships, heart smart power. That trajectory progress undermined combined winds hurricanes global economic recession. Haiti danger stalling. This conference gives us opportunity reignite path progress work team-with Haiti helm-to advance comprehensive, long-term strategy Haiti's growth, coordinating hemispheric international efforts, targeting clear goals, deploying diverse skills resources efficiently effectively. President Preval Prime Minister Pierre Louis identified help Haiti needs get back track. With priorities guide Haiti partner, make high-impact investments help lay foundation stronger democratic institutions, vibrant civil society, open market economy creates stability, attracts international investment, offers jobs wider economic opportunities Haiti region whole. Now time step investment Haiti-not situation dire, consequences inaction could lead significantly larger costs human financial terms road. With $100, pay year schooling one Haitian child immunize five. That's tiny fraction cost solving problems escalate time. The United States target support toward three areas Haitian government requested, aimed promoting conditions essential national regional progress. First, Haitian people need secure. They must able travel safely work school participate civic lives communities without fear violence. Second, country needs stronger infrastructure, particularly roads, circulatory system robust economy. Meanwhile, people Haiti ready work, jobs short supply. We accomplish two things putting people work building roads infrastructure throughout Haiti. And third, last year's hurricanes blew hole government's budget. Now Haiti facing huge deficit, make harder provide services short-term fund major projects long-term. Their debt obligations constrain ability lay groundwork future. On issues-security, jobs infrastructure, debt relief-the United States lending assistance seeking partner nations maximize collective impact. First, security. Effective international partnerships already helped stem violence improve security Haiti. Cite Soleil, example, no-man's-land years, today, violence subsided new sense freedom felt streets. The Haitian National Police supported work UN peacekeeping operation Haiti, first hemisphere Latin American Caribbean nations participated. Brazil led mission determination skill. This level engagement collaboration major step forward region. But criminal networks operating Haiti eliminated. Haiti continues fight drug traffickers made country distribution point illegal drugs headed United States, Canada Europe. Drug trafficking problem involves many nations, role play ending deadly trade. That includes United States. We give $2 million fight drug trafficking Haiti Merida Initiative, plan conceived Mexico, Central America United States. This money fund secure communications network Haitian police; provide maritime base, vehicles operational support police drug units; provide training promote cross-border cooperation Haiti Dominican Republic; sharpen investigation prosecution drug crimes. Once security established, opportunity take root. Nations Canada Spain Japan offered generous assistance help repair damage last year's storms. Now time take next step-to move beyond peacekeeping disaster relief long-term reconstruction development. Haiti highest unemployment rate hemisphere; 70 percent people don't jobs. It also one region's highest population growth rates. Together, trends created one development expert called "youth tsunami"-nearly 1 million youths expected come job market next five years. To spur creation jobs, United States passed HOPE Act 2006, give garments made Haiti tariff-free access U.S. market. Last October, extended trade preference another decade. Apparel one largest sectors Haiti's economy. We see great potential job creation field, gratified Brazil's interest supporting Haitian apparel industry well. But build diversified economy, Haiti needs trade deals. It also needs infrastructure support flow goods services. The roads Haiti beyond inadequate; many communities isolated lack passable road, prevents people holding jobs, children going school, farmers bringing crops market. Better roads could facilitate greater trade bring Haitians global economy. Haiti also needs better roads tourist areas, promote sector economy. Other urgent infrastructure needs include digging water catchments prevent floods, completing garment workers' training center, creating canals help irrigation. As part $287 million non-emergency assistance provide Haiti year, authorized $20 million aid generate jobs, help people put skills work building country's future. We look forward working Haiti distribute money quickly effectively, trigger virtuous circle long-term economic growth. All fiscal responsibility world can't prevent natural disaster. The hurricanes didn't wash away crops houses; also washed away months government planning future. Haiti facing approximately $50 million budget deficit, could undermine Haiti's long-term ambitions well services people depend survive. The United States provide $20 million pay Haiti's upcoming debt service obligations, free Haiti use resources fill budget gap. [There fourth urgent need United States committed helping Haiti resolve. The combined effect rising food prices globally destruction crops hurricanes exposed millions Haitians malnutrition destructive effects health productivity. Malnourished people often weak work; chronically hungry children struggle learn school. Food insecurity source suffering, direct threat economic growth global stability. The United States provide $15-million in-kind contribution food help Haiti continues rebuild. ] These ways United States ready partner Haiti nations. But additional pieces larger mission need support-from helping Haiti adapt climate change future hurricanes won't claim thousands lives; strengthening health systems; promoting sustainable agriculture; developing civil society. This work matter governments, also mission people. Here U.S., I heard many individuals groups care Haiti want help develop don't know invest time money way make real impact. We think creatively helping people outside government get involved meaningful way Haiti's future. Our people valuable resource, potential help places like Haiti yet tapped. We know empirical data small investments go long way. This something I've seen visits Haiti. I traveled husband shortly wedding, years later First Lady. I met doctor emigrated United States became U.S. Air Force Colonel, returned home town Pignon run center health, women's literacy microcredit. He staff resources, offered comprehensive range services thousands clients. I visited family-planning clinic young people trained educate peers protect health prevent teen pregnancy.

Eleven years later, organization larger stronger ever, mission. In addition supporting women candidates, also hold trade fairs women entrepreneurs, run civic education programs teach women rights, support women journalists, build connections women throughout Caribbean. These Haitian women remind us never achieve real progress leave millions people behind. And demonstrate powerful commitment part Haitian people participate lead nation's recovery. Our role support work however can, demonstrate actions belief future important own. What happens next Haiti send message world power collaboration behalf every poor nation worked hard earn foothold global economy tumbled recent months. On behalf every man woman hemisphere, northern expanses Canada southern tip Argentina, working harder ever fewer resources smaller rewards. children whose futures jeopardized forces far beyond control. let us prove commitment economic recovery reaches citizens individual nations people everywhere.

"The bottom line," says Domenici, "is kids risk need highest quality programming, they've gotten worst." It conviction drove Domenici, also school's principal, Forman create three public charter schools underprivileged troubled students District past 11 years. Called Maya Angelou schools, two high schools middle school attack educational deficiencies angles. Students attend small classes taught specially trained staff. The high school day stretches 9 a.m. 6 p.m., three meals provided. Some kids, whose home lives prove chaotic study, offered supervised housing neighborhood. And works. Last year, 93 percent Maya Angelou graduates accepted two- four-year colleges, Domenici says. (According District's Office State Superintendent Education, 29 percent students enter ninth grade D.C. public schools city charter schools enroll postsecondary educational programs within 18 months graduating high school.) It good model. But even though Domenici Forman used teaching court-involved youth -- 40 percent Maya Angelou students spent time Oak Hill -- working inside gates posed new set challenges. Youth Rehabilitation Services court monitor 23 years due part history abuse poor conditions. When Schiraldi took department 2005 began reform efforts implementing less punitive therapeutic detention model Oak Hill, saw immediately changing school essential. "How could I look staff Oak Hill say excellence kids sitting school total waste time 9 3 every day?" Schiraldi says. Kids sat watched movies day. Little, teaching going on, Schiraldi says. "It miserable, miserable school." Schiraldi immediately began lobbying D.C. Board Education hard hire someone new operate school, soon got okay, put request proposals. Domenici Forman submitted plan Schiraldi says "blew ones water," 2007 awarded $12 million contract run school next three years. Domenici's Forman's partnership somewhat unlikely one. Domenici son former New Mexico Republican senator Pete Domenici. He went Stanford Law School, worked corporate law years gave teach work teen delinquents. Forman grandson Jessica Mitford, daughter British baron celebrated civil rights activist journalist. Forman, graduated Yale Law School, worked law clerk Justice Sandra Day O'Connor D.C. public defender. After seeing good schooling options teenage clients had, joined forces Domenici, met mutual friend, start independent school 20 students 1997. A year later, became part first Maya Angelou public charter school. At Oak Hill Academy, principal Domenici fights occasionally maddening bureaucracy basics: functioning boilers, permission college tour group six students, classes uninterrupted corrections staff sometimes call three-quarters students middle class take meds. Forman chairman Maya Angelou Public Charter School Board Directors board member parent group, See Forever Foundation. He attacks hurdles side, fundraising advocating juvenile justice reform. "When David came run school here, like "Ocean's 12": Go find people trust previous mission," Forman jokes. That included past colleagues even Maya Angelou graduates. Samantha Crandal Simpore, then-coed Oak Hill 15 accessory assault charge, went Maya Angelou school runs Oak Hill Academy welcome center. "I tell them, I here, too," Simpore says. She tells new student 17 years old didn't know multiplication tables, rode bus school day hooked Walkman, hoping one knew listening recitation times tables. "I say: 'You're intersection life. You know what's street behind you. Nothing that. But choice what's road ahead.'" Many 90 Oak Hill students, ranging age 14 19, come performing way grade level, nearly half diagnosed learning disabilities. They Oak Hill average 10 months, cycling schedule nothing nine-month academic year. Out necessity, grouped according cell blocks live keep opposing gangs separate. Thirteen-year-olds classes 18-year-olds. More half committed Oak Hill violent felonies. Fights common. (Before month out, Carleto get fistfight hallway delay release date.) Through use small classes -- typically five 14 teens work one teacher, teaching assistant guard -- school organizes curriculum around four-week themes designed pique students' curiosity get think critically nature democracy, social justiCe role world. For example, Relationship theme, students parse types relationships ranging humans natural world (ancient river civilizations) individuals groups (Pharaohs subjects) humans ideas (liberation theology). At time, English class, students working standard five-paragraph essay via guiding question: "Why relationships matter, relationships good bad people?" With current unit, Change, D.C. public school system's learning standards woven social studies curriculum loose headings "Changes Way Humans Think About World Their Place It," becomes way introducing scientific revolution, Enlightenment Magna Carta. It's philosophy emphasizes learning making cross-discipline connections long popular affluent, progressive schools typically eschewed schools underprivileged kids, rote learning return basics often rule. Oak Hill Academy also created course called Advocacy, Georgetown law students co- teaching, emphasizing month's theme. Domenici believes learning law works democracy "is essential teaching good citizens." "We always believed one roles help kids self-advocate advocate behalf community," Domenici says. "We think good skill students individually also one democracy demands." But ambitious agenda, Oak Hill Academy faces significant obstacles. Can teach teens think critically they're missing basic underpinnings education? How teach empowerment setting demands rigid compliance keep kids misbehaving? Although sometimes grows discouraged, Domenici best buoy staff members learn one promising students got fight unit "graduated" program commit another crime sent back. "I talk staff fact that, day day, job absolute best work domain within control," says, reminding don't control pieces puzzle. "And well, done moral thing." His staff members must keep faith straddling two equally potent realities: First, knowledge power, possessing it, every student capable success. And, absent right support, failure lurks right around corner. It sounds like this: "I think Carleto good chance finishing high school going college," Domenici says. Pause. "Also, highly risk that." *** It cold day late January, Oak Hill midst four-week session change. Dressed jeans, blue shirt gray corduroy jacket (the heat's working), Oak Hill social studies teacher John Adams paces around room stops bend Carleto, doodling piece paper desk. "Pay attention," says, taking Carleto's pencil. "Carleto, today's essential question?" "What historical change, different kinds change?" Carleto says, reading board Adams scrawled topic. "Yes," Adams says. He ignores student wandering around room aimlessly, student snatches hat classmate tosses toward hallway. A youth development specialist, corrections guards referred Schiraldi, appears deeply engrossed magazine back room. But snatches hat mid-air, scowls disruptive student tucks hat pocket. "Please sit," Adams tells student. Not quite sitting, quite standing, student perches edge Adams's desk. Good enough. Adams continues: "What's difference personal change historical change?" Silence. "Anybody? More silence. "Ashawntea?" "Historical change like revolution," Ashawntea says. Adams throws list changes -- getting raise salary, moving new house, election President Obama -- Carleto accurately sorts changes micro macro, personal historical. "Obama's campaign change," Adams says. "Do think talking historical change?" He wants students think president, office two days. What might first 100 days look like? asks students. "What advice would offer him?" Carleto looks stumped. "Just throw ideas," Adams prompts. He tells students going craft letters president, advising set agenda change. Carleto slaps pencil desk. "Obama's reading letters," says. He folds arms across chest, skeptical president lay eyes letter -- skeptical, perhaps, teachers really want hear ideas. *** Later, Carleto acknowledge knows quite bit president, reading Barack Obama's "Dreams From My Father." "It started good book, got excellent," says. He struggles hard articulate book's themes appeal. "I don't know put it," says finally, "but growing -- disrespect, -- Caucasian mom African father, still made through." Sitting guard's room gym February evening, echoing sound classmates bouncing basketballs around cavernous gym, Carleto goes tell possibly apocryphal story. "As child, fun, happy -- far kindergarten sixth grade. Starting first grade, honor roll also making school every day," says, beginning third person, quickly lapsing first. "In late stages middle school; end eighth grade, I started smoking weed, stuff I wasn't supposed doing." He takes full responsibility. "No one peer-pressured anything. I liking going I high," explains. He, like almost teens Oak Hill, denies involved gang. Still, Carleto says best friend since elementary school killed 10th grade "a neighborhood thing." "Nowadays, anyone ride you, mistaken someone else shot," says, explaining buddy shot "miscommunication." "It wasn't intended us," says, insisting friend, nicknamed "Smoke," waiting bus. Then announces, "I don't want talk it." So doesn't, though clearly haunts him: He doodle "R.I.P. Smoke" cover blue folder piece loose-leaf paper comer chalkboard. He's happy talk Oak Hill Academy though, 3.5 grade-point average six months. (Domenici says Carleto top 25 percent students Oak Hill tests fairly high assessments.) Carleto likes school even though bit easy him, senior freshman. He complains classes short guards always interrupting move class getting warmed up. That really bugs him, doesn't say much. He says leaving Oak Hill two months intends finish schooling Oak Hill's transition center District, says graduate June. When gets out, couple things wants right off, says. First, intends see girlfriend, go restaurant go "the Adidas shop Georgetown, mom get stuff-- dad, too." He says mom pretty upset got arrested sent Oak Hill. "She was. . . I'm going say kind like surprised actions, I done," Carleto says. "You know say 'Whatever hides dark, comes out?'. . . She ashamed me, disappointed me." Meanwhile, makes long, 45-minute trek District Laurel visit. "Every weekend, days!" says. He alternately vague specific describes family life. He four brothers -- ages 27, 23, 16 11 -- reports two younger brothers live mom. He says mom works secretary, struggles remember where. "She working with, what's program downtown Washington Monument, dealing Smokey Bear?. . . I'm trying think. It's right Holocaust Museum. It's brick building. She works there." Later, Carleto's school case worker, Essence Jones, offer somewhat different account Carleto's life. Although Carleto 12th grade, graduate June says. He still six credits shy, Jones says. And least three months -- two -- release. Carleto's father part life, Jones says. The teenager living aunt coming Oak Hill. His mother, rap sheet dating 1982, jail years, arrested repeatedly string felonies misdemeanors, including possession distribution drugs, well prostitution. She prison since 2005, serving three consecutive sentences totaling seven years assault dangerous weapon, attempted distribution cocaine violation bail. She visiting Carleto weekends. *** By end February, still midst unit change, Oak Hill teens file advocacy class, jostling other, edgy. It unseasonably warm outside, want here. Reluctantly take seats, Carleto positions see patch brown grass mud prison yard, visible door someone wedged open. Occasionally, breeze wafts room. Today, law students decide tackle topic disproportionate minority confinement. If youths color 35 percent general population United States, 62 percent prison population, disproportionate minority confinement, law students explain. They refer teens handout desk front him, article excerpt New American Media, "Racism Juvenile Justice System Revealed," explain isn't simply people color commit crimes: "African-American youths 4.5 times likely, Latinos 2.3 times likely, white youths detained identical offenses. About half white teenagers arrested drug charge go home without formally charged drawn system. Only one-quarter black teens arrested drug charges catch similar break." Although youth color 100 percent Oak Hill's population inmates and, indeed, 100 percent 721 juvenile delinquents currently committed Youth Rehabilitation Services care settings across city, disproportionate minority confinement hard concept teens grasp. Georgetown student Abby Fee tries pie graph, bar graph, sketch disproportionate Xs Os. Blank stares. Then slowly dawns Ashawntea they're talking about. "Hey," says, suddenly sitting forward. "They're switched around! Basically, there's us juveniles prison white juveniles -- even though there's them." "Yes," Fee says. "So population outside system looks lot different inside system." Ashavvntea sits back chair mull over. Fee law students move teens statistics speculative discussion reasons behind figures. They prepared role-playing game coax teens thinking different perspectives. Then, want students practice advocating change. "So, we're going three roles," Fee says, dividing teens pairs. "One group 15-year-old; one group playing math teacher; one group playing city council member." Carleto partner learn play city council member preparing presentation reforming police department. Carleto doesn't want city council member. He doesn't even want today. He wraps unwraps pencil bottom T-shirt. He puts glasses on, takes off. "How could maintain better relationships" police? Fee asks, settling chair help Carleto partner work this. Carleto throws pencil table. Won't answer. She asks again. Silence. Finally, offers sullen challenge. "Stop harassing people reason?" "How want treat people?" "Equally," says. He picks pencil tap, tat, taps desk. Fee tries get specific. "Don't arrest small problems. Instead, take home, tell family you're doing," Carleto's partner says, unconsciously slipping second person. "And think help crime stopped decreased general?" Fee prods. A long pause. Could minds whirring busily; could they're spacing out. Fee, teacher enrolling Georgetown, takes stride. She taps paper couple times repeats question. "Don't 10 15 cars patrolling area barely see police car," Carleto says. "Patrol ward equally?" asks Fee. Carleto writes down, adds: "I see lot cruel things done ain't right." Fee nods, encourages write down. Carleto's partner grabs pencil speaks writes. "The majority police shouldn't carry guns. I could say, 'The majority police racist.'" "But would fix that?" Fee. prods. "A camera car catch they're -- secret one," Carleto suggests. He sits straighter chair. "And don't pull people they're black. They say anything, that's reason I pulled over, headlights whatever." Suddenly, Carleto roll, rattles list improvements. "Call order city council," says Georgetown student Dania Ayoubi. Carleto partner stand front class. "Hello, I'm Mr. Jones, I city councilman," Carleto says, glancing paper twisting tail shirt free hand. "We complaints different communities wards police, suggestions cracking officers." He sounds nervous begins list. "Stop harassing minorities ethnic youths, treat equal race are. Also, police don't arrest situation school like fight anything. I feel arrested taken home. Then tell parents happened reason stopped police." He moves briskly suggestions twice, tentatively, tries actually making eye contact audience. In conclusion, says, "verbally abusing" youth won't tolerated more. "Basically, want crack officers removed, so." Another pair students rises begin presentation, teens interrupted crackle guard's walkie-talkie. "Time go!" guard announces. The law students surprised -- quite done -- politely acquiesce. "Wait!" Ashawntea says, standing up. "We got 10 minutes." "It take five minutes get stuff together get coats on," guard says. "But 10 minutes!" Carleto insists. He Ashawntea sit back fold arms. "It's 2:20. We got 10 minutes still." The guard takes beat, shrugs concedes Carleto's point. He goes back hall wait. Carleto shoots Ashawntea look surprise. His advocacy worked. "Yesss!" Ashawntea hisses breath.

Within four years, every American could required health insurance pay way tax penalties. The odds sea change rose last week chief Democratic Republican Senate negotiators health care bill acknowledged many Finance Committee considered so-called individual mandate essential lower insurance costs already coverage. President Barack Obama didn't embrace individual mandate campaign, means would essentially start scratch terms selling idea voters. The mandate central policy difference Hillary Clinton, argued mandate way achieve universal coverage. Obama disagreed, saying enough people would purchase insurance voluntarily costs could brought down. Progressive policy experts widely agreed Obama's plan would left 15 million people.

Barack Obama may support insurance mandate By CARRIE BUDOFF BROWN I 6/3/09 3:42 PM EDT Updated: 6/3/09 11:22 PM EDT As presidential candidate, Barack Obama scoffed Hillary Rodham Clinton's proposal require people buy health insurance. "(If) can't afford it, don't get it," Obama said primary, arguing mandate would work unless insurance costs lowered first. For first time, Obama confirmed Wednesday plans stake different position president. In letter two leading Democratic senators, Obama said could support mandate individuals buy coverage, long Congress exempted could afford it. This marks shift stance campaign, tussled repeatedly Clinton issue. She proposed individual mandate, not. "I share goal ending lapses gaps coverage make us less healthy drive everyone's costs, I open ideas shared responsibility," Obama wrote. "But I believe going make people responsible owning health insurance, must make health care affordable." "If end system people responsible insurance, need provide hardship waiver exempt Americans cannot afford it," Obama wrote. Detailing positions various health care proposals first time president, Obama also said Americans able choose public private insurance plans reformed health care system. "I strongly believe Americans choice public health insurance option operating alongside private plans," wrote. "This give better range choices, make health care market competitive, keep insurance companies honest." He offered qualified support mandate employers provide insurance pay fee government. Employers "have responsibility support health insurance employees," Obama wrote, small businesses exempt. Obama's positions issues entirely surprising, decision weigh congressional Democratic leaders released single bill unexpected. Prior letter, Obama aides declined say specifically stood various issues, including public plan individual mandate, saying wanted Congress lead way writing bill. But Democrats anxious president take public stance, letter provides guidance many Congress craving House Senate committees move closer releasing draft bills. "The president says get done. Get done right get one chance," said Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), member Senate Health, Education, Labor Pensions Committee. "The letter essentially synthesizes president saying." He outlined parameters letter Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) Health, Education, Labor Pensions Committee Chairman Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.). Obama's endorsement public insurance option could boost controversial proposal serve catalyst Democratic base president kicks grassroots campaign Saturday. "It's clear Republican resistance public plan hasn't softened President Obama's support one," Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said statement. "This strengthens hand us advocating public option, way keep private insurers' feet fire." Despite almost uniform opposition Republicans public plan, president wrote letter remains "hopeful many Republicans" would back overhaul bill. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), ranking Republican Finance Committee, struck optimistic tone statement, saying letter "doesn't draw lines sand," "is helpful statements reform legislation needs bipartisan support." However, letter likely incite opponents, frustrated Obama's lack specifics. Indeed, Thursday morning, Conservatives Patients' Rights begin airing new TV ad called "Bulldozer," says "government-run plan" drive private insurers business eliminate consumer choices.

Sorry flood email, I couldn't resist sending Ben Smith A year later, Hillary wins A year ago today, final set primaries made official foregone conclusion Barack Obama won primary, Hillary Clinton lost it. There's far much going today dwell anniversary, seem worth noting one particular piece news light: On central health care policy debate Democratic Primary -- was, fair, conducted within fairly narrow frame -- Obama appears conceded today Senate plan likely closely resemble Clinton's. In dense, careful letter Ted Kennedy Max Baucus, Obama offered principles health care plan conceded central point: He open individual mandate, campaigned against, talked Senators parties buzzword "shared responsibility." Obama still backs "hardship waiver" people unable afford mandate -- consistent core objection mandate. But cast principled difference approach -- problem merely people couldn't afford insurance? something more? -- seems conceded. Here's relevant paragraph: I understand Committees moving towards principle shared responsibility -- making every American responsible health insurance coverage, asking employers share cost. I share goal ending lapses gaps coverage make us less healthy drive everyone's costs, I open ideas shared responsibility. But I believe going make people responsible owning health insurance, must make health care affordable. If end system people responsible insurance, need provide hardship waiver exempt Americans cannot afford it. In addition, I believe employers responsibility support health insurance employees, small businesses face number special challenges affording health benefits exempted. B6 B6 By Ben Smith 07:51 PM

Just wanted sure saw Kurtzer op-ed, ran Sunday Post. Kudos Jonathan Prince getting written placed. The Settlements Facts • By Daniel Kurtzer Sunday, June 14, 2009 Faulty analysis Israeli settlement issue passed fact. Charles Krauthanuner's June 5 column, "The Settlements Myth," one example. Here facts: In 2003, Israeli government accepted, reservations, "road map" peace, imposed two requirements Israel regarding settlements: "GO! [Government Israel] immediately dismantles settlement outposts erected since March 2001. Consistent Mitchell Report, GOI freezes settlement activity (including natural growth settlements)." Today, Israel maintains three events -- namely, draft understandings discussed 2003 Prime Minister Ariel Sharon U.S. deputy national security adviser Stephen Hadley; President George W. Bush's April 14, 2004, letter Sharon; April 14 letter Sharon adviser Dov Weissglas national security adviser Condoleezza Rice -- constitute formal understanding United States accepted continuing Israeli building within "construction line" settlements. The problem understanding. The first event Israelis cite 2003 discussions four-part draft included notion construction within settlements might permitted confined already built-up areas settlements. The idea draw line around outer perimeter built-up areas settlements allow building inside line. This draft never codified, effort made define line around built-up areas settlements. Nonetheless, Israel began act largely accordance reading provisions, probably believing U.S. silence conferred assent. Second, President Bush's 2004 letter conveyed U.S. support agreed outcome negotiations Israel would retain "existing major Israeli population centers" West Bank "on basis mutually agreed changes. . . ." One key provisions letter U.S. support Israel's retaining settlements predicated "agreed outcome" negotiations. Despite Israel's contention letter allowed continue building large settlement blocs Ariel, Maale Adumim Gush Etzion, letter convey U.S. support understanding Israeli settlement activities areas run-up peace agreement. In 2004 letter Rice, Weissglas addressed issue "construction line," saying "within agreed principles settlement activities, effort made next days better definition construction line settlements Judea & Samaria." However, never "agreed principles settlement activities." Moreover, effort define "construction line" never consummated: Israel United States discussed briefly reach agreement definition construction line settlements. Weissglas's letter also promised "continuous action" remove unauthorized outposts, Israel removed almost none them. Throughout period, Bush administration regularly protest Israel's continuing settlement activity. But different arguing United States agreed it. In recent days, former senior Bush administration officials told journalists background understandings existed Israel regarding continued settlement activity. Commentators also focus Obama administration's reiteration freeze must include "natural growth" settlements. Krauthammer says "means strangling death thriving towns close 1949 armistice line. . . It means increase population. Which means babies." This nonsense. No one suggests Israelis stop babies. Rather, blessing new baby translate right build apartments houses settlements. The two issues nothing other. Israelis, like Americans, move time life circumstances -- children, jobs, housing availability -- change. The pattern population growth territories actually undercuts natural-growth argument. Since 1993, Israel signed Oslo Accords, Israel's West Bank settler population grown 116,300 289,600. The numbers East Jerusalem increased 152,800 186,000. This goes far beyond natural increase families already living settlements. Inserting provision "natural growth" official documents started 2001 Mitchell Report 2003 "road map," reflecting recognition concept abused justification expanding settlements. The Obama administration pursuing policies every administration since 1967 articulated -- settlements jeopardize possibility achieving peace thus settlement activity stop. This diminish Palestinians' responsibilities, especially commitment stop violence terrorism uproot terrorist infrastructure. President Obama emphasized Cairo speech. But Palestinian failures no" way justify Israeli failure implement road map commitments respect settlements outposts. It time Israel freeze settlement activity dismantle unauthorized outposts.

"I leave Africa remarkable trip even committed," Mrs. Clinton said leaving Cape Verde. "I seen joy energy Africans have, evidenced boogieing, hard work perseverance," said, referring recent comment husband, former President Bill Clinton, knew "boogie" African dancers. "And we've seen worst humanity itself," added, presumably referring Congo, Mrs. Clinton met victims brutal civil war seem end. Mrs. Clinton seemed satisfied accomplished mission: strengthening American relations crucial allies continent, like Nigeria South Africa, sending message "tough love," called it, nations like Kenya Congo. Over all, said, United States wants work closely African nations partner, simply patron dispenser aid. In exchange, said, African leaders must deliver democracy good government. Mrs. Clinton vowed stay top Africa, even gets back Washington, closely monitoring issues addressed tour. She also pointed Cape Verde, set palm-studded islands best known beaches enormous tourist hotels, example good leadership do. "This possible," said. "You create economic growth sense human dignity possibility." Kenya. South Africa. Angola. Congo. Nigeria. Liberia. And finally Cape Verde. Mrs. Clinton saw eyes Africa's promising countries - troubled ones. In Kenya, pushed government prosecute perpetrators postelection violence last year. In South Africa, big issue Zimbabwe South African government help ease crisis there. In Angola, theme good governing practices oil, strategic concern United States given many inroads China made elsewhere Africa hunger natural resources. In Congo, Mrs. Clinton passionate need end nation's rape epidemic. "The secretary's visit heart world's deadliest war zone eastern Congo potential game-changer conflict," said John Prendergast, founder Washington-based Enough project. "Her commitment addressing root causes conflict minerals power electronics industry refreshing contrast usual disaster sympathy tourism visiting dignitaries." "Now," added, "comes hard part: making good promises living high expectations engendered visit." In Nigeria, Mrs. Clinton pressed electoral changes. In Liberia, praised country's president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, woman Africa elected head state. The Liberian visit special warmth, almost like meeting long-lost cousins. Liberia founded 19th century freed American slaves, country's flag, people's names even police uniforms plastic- brimmed hats reminiscent American versions. Mrs. Clinton received possibly exuberant welcome there, Liberian man long wooden horn followed around visit, blowing loud funny noises whenever said something striking. "I love - horn - I want take guy wherever I go," said. In Cape Verde, Mrs. Clinton seemed bones pick. For once, said, cheat sheet country included list far positives negatives. The country fewer 500,000 people escaped turmoil engulfed much Africa. The all-inclusive, poolside buffet resorts feel like something found CanctIn Bahamas. Mrs. Clinton called Cape Verde "a model democracy economic progress Africa." On Friday, every stop, started speech saying, "I bring greetings President Obama." She called "son Africa" said Obama administration, United States determined help Africa reach promise. ###

Let raise idea could present arrangement settlements seeking Israel I understand it, i.e. moratorium coupled allowances complete number housing units. There two ways: 1. To describe agreement, explaining US accepted Israeli completion handful units whose construction already begun. This raises concerns. It would represent U.S. legitimization (however small) Israeli activity West Bank would trigger Arab Palestinian complaints compromised, sowing doubts effectiveness. 2. The alternative would administration say: a. We come long way, Israel made unprecedented commitments U.S. terms settlements freeze. This welcome development. b. We achieve hoped Israel intends complete number housing units. We differences Israeli government matter expressed them.. •c. That said, convinced substantial progress made warrants immediate resumption peace talks well Arab steps toward Israel help promote two-state solution.

Report: North Korea willing hold talks US AP By KWANG-TAE KIM Associated Press Sat Jul 25, 4:51 ET SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea indicated interest holding direct talks United States, news report said, two sides traded barbs Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programs security forum. "We dialogue. We negotiation issues common concern," Japan's Kyodo news agency quoted North Korean ambassador United Nations Sin Son Ho saying Friday. But ambassador, speaking New York, dismissed possibility return stalled nuclear negotiations involving two Koreas, U.S., Japan, China Russia, saying "the six-party talks gone forever." The U.S. offered hold talks North within six-nation process returns negotiating table takes irreversible steps denuclearization. Last weekend, Assistant U.S. Secretary State Kurt Campbell indicated chances direct talks North Korea U.S. slim. "Our bilateral negotiations U.S. South Korea collective approach" North, Campbell told reporters Seoul. Sin said five parties nuclear talks "cheated" North Korea, accusing implementing agreed disarmament-for-aid deal. No details given Kyodo report. Sin available comment Saturday. The North Korean mission U.N. declined comment. North Korea quit nuclear talks April protest U.N. statement condemning rocket launch. North Korea insisted sent satellite orbit, U.S. allies said actually long-range missile test. North Korea conducted second nuclear test May barrage missile tests July, drawing international condemnation new U.N. sanctions. U.S. Chinese officials expected discuss North Korea's nuclear programs regional security issues strategic dialogue next week Washington. "North Korea significant topic, obviously one among many," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said Friday Washington. The U.S. North Korea engaged sharp war words earlier week U.S. Secretary State Hillary Rodham Clinton's recent comment likening regime Pyongyang "small children" demanding attention. At regional security conference Thailand, Clinton also said North "has friends left." North Korea's Foreign Ministry described Thursday "a funny lady" sometimes "looks like primary schoolgirl sometimes pensioner going shopping." 298

Whenever something big TV hear lots folks saying great. But time noticeably different. First, people across spectrum - DC insiders, reporters, staff, ex-staff, friends friends, WH folks, etc - blown away. Second, people REALLY moved last segment, three people even told teared up. I'm guessing hoping hear directly random folks coming days. And I think it's lousy couple weeks Admin, mixed messages bad news, coupled many people seeing first time extended period talking job relationship President, combo probably powerful reminder since speech Denver you're class (including President became enmeshed Gates incident) That didn't wait envoy question key, turned strength.

It's quite possibly best thing written SecState. We're getting around friends & family, along People op-ed NYT Mag q&a - great weekend terms positive press. It's 3 a.m. Do You Know Where Hillary Clinton Is? By David Rothkopf Washington Post Sunday, August 23, 2009 When comes Hillary Rodham Clinton, we're missing forest pantsuits. Clinton first celebrity become nation's top diplomat -- honor goes distant predecessor, Thomas Jefferson, time took office one famous gossiped-about men America -- may biggest. And first seven months office, former first lady, erstwhile presidential candidate eternal lightning rod drawn attention moods, looks, outtakes (of course) relationship husband for, well, work revamping nation's foreign policy. Even venerable publications -- one I regularly contribute, Foreign Policy -- woven all- Hillary-all-the-time coverage odd discussions Clinton's handbag scarf choices. Daily Beast editor Tina Brown, depicting Clinton supporter, scathing small-minded discussing things Clinton's weight hair, "defense" Hillary essay "Obama's Other Wife" sexist title suggests. Indeed, sexism followed Clinton campaign trail Foggy Bottom, seen recently posturing outrage surrounding exchange Congo Clinton reacted understandable frustration now-infamous question regarding husband's views. Major media outlets joined gossipfest, whether New York Times, covered Clinton's first big policy speech discussing whether White House, The Washington Post, couple reporters mused whether brew called Mad Bitch would beer choice secretary state. Amid distractions, Clinton actually doing? Only overseeing may profound changes U.S. foreign policy two decades -- transformation may render presidencies Bill Clinton George W. Bush mere side notes long transition meaningful post-Cold War worldview. The secretary quietly begun rethinking nature diplomacy translating vision revitalized State Department, one approaches U.S. allies rivals ways challenge long-held traditions. And despite pessimists invoked "team rivals" cliche predict President Obama Clinton would get along, Hillary defined role Obamaverse: often bad cop good cop, spine stiffener comes tough adversaries nurturer new strategies. Recognizing 3 a.m. phone calls going White House, instead tackling tough questions that, since end Cold War, kept America's leaders awake night. In early days new administration, easy focus Clinton achieved ways power supposedly constrained. Indeed, efforts frustrated difficult personnel approvals disputes White House get jobs. But way administrations. More unusual avidity new president seized reins foreign policy -- assertively either George W. Bush Bill Clinton him. Obama's centrality amplifies importance closest White House staffers, penchant appointing special envoys Richard Holbrooke (on Afghanistan Pakistan) George Mitchell (on Middle East) interpreted limiting Clinton's role. Given challenges involved, perhaps natural White House would bigger day-to-day hand nation's urgent foreign policy issues. But Obama, national security adviser Jim Jones, Vice President Joe Biden Secretary Defense Robert Gates absorbed Iraq, Afghanistan inherited problems recent past, Clinton's State Department take bigger role tackling problems future -- particular, America lead world century ahead. This approach necessary canny: It recognizes U.S. policy must change fulfill Obama's vision many high-profile issues Middle East often swamped careers aspirations secretaries state past. Which nations key partners? What many vital partners -- China, example, Russia -- rivals well? How must America's alliances change NATO stretched limit? How engage rogue states old enemies ways strengthen preserve prerogative challenge threats? How move beyond diplomacy men striped pants speaking governments embrace potent nonstate players once-disenfranchised peoples? In searching answers, Clinton leaving behind old doctrines labels. She outlined new thinking recent speech Council Foreign Relations New York, revealed stark differences new administration's worldview predecessors: The recurring themes include "partnership" "engagement" "common interests." Clearly, Madeleine Albright's "indispensable nation" recognized indispensability collaborating others. Who "others" area change greatest rapid. "We put," Clinton said, "special emphasis encouraging major emerging global powers -- China, India, Russia Brazil, well Turkey, Indonesia South Africa -- full partners tackling global agenda." This death knell G-8 head table global community; administration effort underway determine whether successor G-8 G-20, perhaps grouping. Though move away G-8 began waning days Bush era, administration viewed world different lens, perception evolved traditional great-power view pre-Galilean notion everything revolved around world's sole superpower. Obama Clinton made engaging emerging powers priority. Obama visited Russia earlier year host Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh first state dinner November. Clinton made trips China India, would Obama Russia injured elbow. Both visited Africa Middle East, reaching women Islamic world. On many critical agenda items -- rollback nuclear weapons climate trade talks -- emerging powers essential achieving U.S. goals. As result, we've seen new American willingness play old differences, whether Russia missile shield or, Clinton showed China trip, Beijing human rights. At center Clinton's brain trust Anne-Marie Slaughter, former dean Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School Public International Affairs. Now head policy planning State Department, Slaughter elaborated ideas Clinton's speech. "We envision getting new group states around table, also building networks, coalitions partnerships states nonstate actors tackle specific problems," told me. "To that," Slaughter continued, "our diplomats going need skills closer community organizing traditional reporting analysis. New connecting technologies vital tools kind diplomacy." A new team brought make changes real. Clinton recruited Alec Ross, one leaders Obama's technology policy team, seventh floor State Department senior adviser innovation. His mission harness new information tools advance U.S. interests -- task made easier Internet mobile networks played starring roles recent incidents, Iran Uighur uprising western China Moldova. Whether telecommunications program Congo protect women violence text messaging raise money Pakistani refugees Swat Valley, technology deployed reach new audiences. Of course, need new ideas revitalize State Department; need resources, too. The secretary brought former Bill Clinton-era budget chief Jack Lew help claw back money statecraft many Foggy Bottom feel sucked toward Pentagon. She also created special positions back new priorities, Melanne Verveer ambassador large women's issues, Elizabeth Bagley handle public-private outreach worldwide Todd Stern chief negotiator climate. Even months in, it's clear appointments far window dressing. Lew, Slaughter acting head U.S. Agency International Development leading effort rethink foreign aid new Quadrennial Diplomacy Development Review, initiative modeled Pentagon's strategic assessments designed review State's priorities. Stern conducted high-level discussions climate change around world, notably China. Clinton made women's issues centerpiece recent 11-day trip Africa, stressed "the social, political economic marginalization women across Africa left void continent undermines progress prosperity." Clinton also signaled importance private-sector experience naming former Goldman Sachs International vice chairman Robert Hormats, respected veteran four administrations, handle economic issues State Department, well Judith McHale, former chief executive Discovery Communications, run public diplomacy. In vein, opened Cuba American telecommunications companies reached India's private sector energy cooperation -- showing administration seek advance national interests tapping self-interests business community. As new administration, inevitable problems. The old campaign teams -- Clinton's Obama's -- still eye warily, feeling gradually fading. And accounts, administration's national security team come together successfully, Clinton developing strong relationships national security adviser Jones Defense Secretary Gates. Her policy deputy, Jim Steinberg, renewed old collaboration deputy national security adviser Tom Donilon; two them, working Obama campaign foreign policy advisers Denis McDonough Mark Lippert, formed one State Department seventh-floor dweller called "a powerful quartet heart real interagency policymaking." Henry Kissinger may overstated matters said best White House-State relationship recent memory, it's bad, State-Pentagon relationship best shape decades. At heart things, though, relationship Clinton Obama. For administration's talk international partnerships, may critical partnership all. So far, according multiple high-level officials State White House, two seem aligned views. In addition, gradually defining complementary roles. Obama assumed role principal spokesperson foreign policy, international audiences welcome new improved American brand. Clinton thus far echoed points also delivered tougher ones. Whether missile shield Iran North Korean saber-rattling, continued imprisonment Aung San Suu Kyi Burma rape corruption Congo, secretary state spoken bluntly world stage -- even triggered snide comments North Korea. It still early, president's foreign policy legacy often defined less big principles one reacts unexpected, whether missiles Cuba terrorism New York. Promising ideas fail limited attention reluctant bureaucracies, rhetoric eventually rings hollow, self-congratulatory "smart power" already me. Nevertheless, evidence that, seven months job, Obama's unlikely secretary state supporting augmenting agenda effectively. Not Obama's "other wife," Bill Clinton's wife, even celebrity former presidential candidate -- new role making.

Some 1100 rapes reported month, average 36 women girls raped every day.". Triple checking origins. Hillary Clinton Pledges 'Banish Sexual Violence' Originally posted Friday August 21, 2009 12:30 PM EDT Secretary State Hillary Clinton may taking well-earned R&R Bermuda week, last week, former First Lady U.S. Senator wrapped grueling seven-nation diplomatic mission Africa. While much made back home snapping Congolese student asked Bill Clinton's thoughts trade issue ("My husband secretary state, I am," retorted), emotional heart tour also dangerous stop — Goma, inside war zone eastern Congo, tearfully met rape victims Aug. 11.In exclusive Op-Ed piece PEOPLE.com, Secretary Clinton shares learned visit - it. What I Saw Goma By Hillary Rodham Clinton In 11 days travel across Africa, I saw humanity worst — best. In Goma last week, I saw both. The Mugunga Internally Displaced Persons Camp sits land volcanoes great lakes edge Goma, provincial capital eastern Congo. The camp home 18,000 people seeking refuge cycle violent conflict left 5.4 million dead since 1998. Chased homes villages armed rebels informal militias, men, women children walked miles little food water reached relatively safe haven. Now live tents, one next other, row row, clinging life, others hanging whatever glimmer hope remains region plagued years brutality. Many people robbed homes, possessions, families and, worst all, dignity. Women girls particular victimized unimaginable scale, sexual gender-based violence become tactic war reached epidemic proportions. Some 1,100 rapes reported month, average 36 women girls raped every day. I visited hospital run organization Heal Africa met woman told eight months' pregnant attacked. She home group men broke in. They took husband two children shot front yard, returning house shoot two children. Then beat gang-raped left dead. But wasn't dead. She fought life neighbors managed get hospital — 85 kilometers away. I came Goma send clear message: The United States condemns attacks commit abet them. They crimes humanity. These acts don't harm single individual, single family, village, group. They shred fabric weaves us together human beings. Such atrocities place society. This truly humanity worst. But reason hope. We seen survivors summon courage rebuild lives communities. We seen civic leaders organizations come together combat appalling scourge. And seen health care workers sacrifice comfortable careers treat wounded Goma, I met doctors advocates work every day repair broken bodies spirits women raped, often gangs, often brutal fashion longer bear children, walk work. Caregivers like Lyn Lusi, founded Heal Africa Goma, Dr. Denis Mukwege, founded Panzi hospital Bukavu, represent humanity best. The United States stand brave people. This week I announced $17 million new funding prevent respond gender sexual violence Democratic Republic Congo. We provide medical care, counseling, economic assistance legal support. We dedicate nearly $3 million recruit train police officers protect women girls investigate sexual violence. We send technology experts help women front-line workers report abuse using photographs video share information treatment legal options. And deploy team civilian experts, medical personnel military engineers assess assist survivors sexual violence. While I DRC, I frank discussions sexual violence President Kabila. I stressed perpetrators crimes, matter are, must prosecuted punished. This particularly important positions authority, including members Congolese military, allowed commit crimes impunity. Our commitment survivors sexual gender-based violence begin visit Goma, end departure. We redoubling efforts address fundamental cause violence: fighting goes eastern Congo. We taking additional steps United Nations concert nations bring end conflict. There old Congolese proverb says, "No matter long night, day sure come." The day must come women eastern Congo walk freely again, tend fields, play children collect firewood water without fear. They live region unrivaled natural beauty rich resources. They strong resilient. They could, given opportunity, drive economic social progress would make country peaceful prosperous. Working together, banish sexual violence dark past, belongs, help Congolese people seize opportunities new day.

Sounds good -- copies tomorrow morning schedules.
See below. Will send PIR comments shortly. To: CDM Fr: Caitlin Re: Branch Book Overview: There surprises book. The "surprises" might exist buried took close reading pick on—the two main ones terror clause WJC's crime bill hadn't disclosed information Lewinsky (because hadn't wanted become witness her). There lot things covered My Life publications. Quite honestly book pretty boring much focused Branch I anticipated. While "and day, next day" My Life, share many elements would engage true Clinton fanatic historian. The fact appears index also makes difficult anyone looking quick hit get one. Furthermore, WJC's words interlaced Branch's recollection dictations, number direct WJC quotes far fewer I expected. HRC much player one might imagine. Her role largely seen interactions Branch recording WJC. Her statements consistent past, exception Gephardt comment, didn't grab much attention all.Ell (Others included HRC's devotion CVC, thought special prosecutor images returning meetings. They pretty much aligned interactions Branch.) Surprisingly, surprisingly, many problems discussed book those, face current Administration—Middle East peace, North Korea, China, etc... Branch repeatedly injects feelings specific subjects seems use book voice opinion Administration events time. He clearly topics prefers others (for example connection events Haiti result lot discussion it), subjects strikingly sparsely discussed Rwanda. Its absence long discussions surprising, appear thought WJC ever-dodged questions topic, weren't addressed. Much like My Life, one theme repeated WJC's conflict disdain media, especially long passages NYT Washington Post. There instances gives credit reporting, would hard-pressed find them. Additionally, numerous mentions WJC's acute allergies chronic fatigue, imagery falling asleep sessions couple occasions. The book quite bit Whitewater, given dearth public documentation little Branch could write hadn't said. One thing I recalled D'Amato's subpoena CVC's friends, later quashed, slept HRC's Rose Law Firm records White House. Branch portray helpful distinction WJC looked Whitewater scandals. While WJC attacks Whitewater political hunt, Branch WJC saying Filegate needed separated Whitewater, legitimate inquiry. There quips could catch someone's eye, WJC referring Paula Jones "a 'new bimbo' [WJC] didn't even recognize." Branch dwell Lewinsky impeachment. With exception Bruce, Bennett Kendall, lawyers mentioned. There one passage I looking into, WJC says part reason didn't mention relationship Lewinsky first threatened jail time found lying oath told truth could become witness her. This small passage could easily missed, one important note I don't recall hearing before. (This addressed fully below.) There relationships track book others. They include WJC's relationship Gore, maps part focal point end, contentious relationship Janet Reno. The one Senator appears discussed negatively Moynihan. All three issues discussed turn below. WJC portrayed extremely loving attentive father HRC portrayed much human light books/articles covering time period, ample mention relationship CVC images affection WJC, pre- post-impeachment. On foreign relations lot time spent discussing Middle East, Northern Ireland, Balkans, China, Russia, Pakistan/India beginning book, Haiti. (Note: Much written Haiti Branch's experience subject.) There also fair amount discussion North Korea, nothing discussed past weeks. Bin Laden discussed seems track mention My Life, seems detail background book. In certain cases detail My Life, example trip Pakistan WJC wrote USSS cancelled one stop would "defenseless" flying in, whereas Brach writes streets would lined "assassins." There candid looks WJC's take certain people relationship some, Albright Berger's dislike Holbrooke, detailed depiction Yeltsin's drinking, yelling outside Blair House cab get pizza. One thing note, often times WJC seems speaking Branch intentionally without recorders going, Branch writes interactions exchanges nonetheless. Such case HRC's Gephardt comment. The following items addressed memo: Wen Ho Lee Terror Clause Crime Bill 4 WJC Lewinsky's Silence 4 HRC Kissinger 4 HRC gay/lesbian 5 Tension Moynihan 5 HRC World Player 5 Jesse Jackson 6 Tension Janet Reno 6 Portrayal Carter 7 Relationship Gore 8 Other (This includes: Maggie recommending Panetta, HRC Haiti Invasion, ITAV co-author flap, Subpoenas CVC's Friends, Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex, Gore/HRC ticket, WJC suggesting Rubin run Senate, Trip South Asia) 11 Wen Ho Lee Terror Clause Crime Bill In discussing Wen Ho Lee's release Branch characterizes WJC's lack knowledge strained interpretation anti-terrorist provisions crime bill arbitrary detentions "confession." My Life mentions Lee's accusation passing discuss Lee. Below two passages Branch's book first giving context second Terror Clause Crime Bill. ➢ The year closed spies terrorism. The Justice Department, fierce debate among security agencies, indicted nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee fifty-nine counts copying classified material personal computer. Lee handled like radioactive espionage defendant—no bail, lockdown, solitary confinement—even though long dragnet produced evidence offered secrets China anyone else. The president said experts telling worst spies sometimes stored treason rainy day. This sounded fishy me. Clinton shrugged. Nothing would please establish Lee's innocence. [Branch, 577] ➢ While Lee indicted, Branch writes WJC noted others "were held secret, uncharged untried...He [WJC] embarrassed sponsored measure law without foreseeing arbitrary detentions...Under terrorist act, prosecutor decide within legal limit...whether bring charges testimony secret informant otherwise. To dismay, Clinton learned defendants held incommunicado six months. One extreme detention last three years. 'I think it's wrong,' [WJC] said. 'It's American. We accept guilty people street enjoy protect freedom.' [Branch, 629] WJC Lewinsky's Silence Branch writes part WJC's motive discussing happened Lewinsky could send jail, denied it. ➢ "Also, pointed Starr threatening jail Lewinsky year sworn denial affair. If Clinton come forward anything relationship, said Starr could turned witness Lewinsky, betraying discreet silence. Such subtleties, original, struck tendentious. The president never claimed chivalry real motive steadfast denial, dispute essential truth Lewinsky's account." [Branch, 511] HRC Kissinger The following could fodder people want continue string along notion channeling Eleanor Roosevelt. ➢ There passage HRC describes exchange Kissinger dinner complained health care bill passed wouldn't able see doctor. She continued say "it interesting, fact, dreamed Kissinger nights before. His visage turned suddenly effervescent banquet, announcing gladly worries Clinton health care bill dying. 'Oh, no, Dr. Kissinger,' replied coolly. 'Don't sure it's dead. We'll keep fighting, there's always light end tunnel.' She said Kissing blanched, speechless deft reminder Vietnam War...Now last, Hillary's dream, registered strategic designs spewed carnage venom seven needless years...'That's I dreamed,' Hillary repeated, lost thought. 'You know, I always get revenge dreams, never real life.' [Branch, 179] HRC gay/lesbian Writing call HRC NYS, Branch recalls WJC's counsel got "exercised." WJC left room. "He subdued return. 'You know, I've lot contact gay people life Hillary.' He sighed. Her temperament conservative, religious core, formed homosexual issues even mentionable. New York politics tough crucible, unsure heat could take. On hand, personal experience could speed adaptation." [Branch, 551] Tension Moynihan There several occasions throughout book Branch recalls WJC's grievances frustration Moynihan. For example: > When Moynihan called international arms embargo unilaterally lifted Bosnia could fight themselves, Branch writes, "The president flinched I mentioned [it]...'That's freebie him,' snapped Clinton, 'and knows it.'" [p.140] > In regard health care: "Echoing comments Hillary dinner, [WJC] faulted Senator Moynihan aimless hearings conducted without strategy theme." [p.170] ➢ Discussing Independent Counsel: "She [HRC] especially scornful Democrats, quoted number them. Senator Moynihan, instance, publicly said Clintons nice people sure nothing hide. 'Why investigation?' often asked. She said Moynihan skated blithely surface, never produced results Congress, could withstand scrutiny five minutes, living apartment secured chairmanship Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation." [Brach, 182] ➢ "Donnybrook" argument Moynihan said fundraising speech WJC gave citing regretted hypothetical controversial decision. Moynihan told press, "He doesn't understand...that he's conceding principles." WJC confronted lack context given statement press said Moynihan knew "feeding beast hostile presumption Clinton's motives." [Branch, 299] HRC World Player There several images HRC player world stage, WJC own. Several examples follow: ➢ Middle East: Discussing peace King Hussein: "They retreated lunch two couples—the Clintons, king wife, Queen Noor—in family dining room... Their agenda delicate race Hussein's failing health desire make peace Israel. The president said Hillary pounded away symptoms national estrangement: closed boarders, water disputes, travel barriers, war grievances, contested airspace, sealed electrical grids, on. Hussein gave feast goodwill without commitment point." [Branch, 170] > South Asia: Regarding trip South Asia CVC 1995, "Her [HRC's] schedule far demanding ceremonial, pushing conflict resolution civic empowerment downtrodden women." [Branch, 236] Later Branch tells Benazir Bhutto praising CVC HRC. "By contrast superficial American press, portrayed Hillary demure tourist policy significance exotic Asia, Bhutto said touched essential political chords whirlwind encouragements citizenship groups small-scale economic development." (The note contrasting Bhutto corresponds NYT article Branch quotes footer saying, "she [HRC] played traditional role First Lady wife mother...") [Branch, 246] > China Speech: Branch outlines HRC felt speech needed bigger China depicted "harsh reality everywhere" China Africa. He cites WJC commenting rave reviews HRC's speech. [Branch, 289] ➢ Regarding Russian financial system meltdown, Branch writes "Yeltsin seemed removed urgent political tasks Clintons counseled directly." [Branch, 512-513] Jesse Jackson Branch writes Jesse Jackson calling CVC Lewinsky story broke continued contact throughout period. WJC thanks support CVC. This goes detail WJCs gratitude, fact Jackson "counseled" CVC public knowledge dating back least 1999. ➢ "But Jesse done something would forget. When Lewinsky news broke, called Chelsea Stanford.

He know everything involved, wanted remind Chelsea much parents loved her. Their family needed stick together all, needed counsel, rage, pray, always available." [Branch, 497] Tension Janet Reno Throughout book, nomination her, WJC portrayed opinion negative opinion Janet Reno. > "He complained Janet Reno—made clear, fact, felt alienated attorney general. If removed her, however, pending decision yet another special prosecutor [for 1996 campaign finance] would fall Reno's deputy, Jamie Gorelick, who, Clinton feared, may share Reno's wholesale devotion outside control case president may become target...If removed Reno Gorelick, start fresh, would touch firestorm protest like Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre Justice Department officials Watergate scandal. That option." [Branch, 388-389] > Branch writes WJC talking Reno Louis Freeh disregarding letter D'Amato continuing allow independent counsel go Ciseneros. The held true Mike Espy. Branch outlines meeting WJC Reno. Reno made public statements "desire stay job. 'I told I didn't like one damn bit,' president said tersely. 'I didn't hire work New York Times Washington Post. I hired work me.'" [Branch, 398] He continues outline Clinton give Reno credit good achievements including coordination U.S. attorneys didn't blame special prosecutor Whitewater, "he blame abdicating responsibility supervise investigations ever since, letting mandates multiply almost will. She accepted criteria ludicrous crassly partisan. Reno failed defend presidency itself—not Clinton personally, institution—and extension entire executive branch...He told clue meant. His advisers considered naïve upright, fuzziness distinction seemed save her." [Branch, 399] He cites Clinton warned prepare staying job entire second term. Portrayal Jimmy Carter There parallels could drawn WJC/BHO Carter/WJC terms Carter's trip North Korea mission went Haiti. WJC clearly frustrated Carter's seeming desire front lines. North Korea: ➢ "On North Korea, [WJC] said Jimmy Carter initiated recent trip call Al Gore, Clinton approved volunteer mission break North Korea's extreme isolation... Sure enough, Carter reach North Korean dictator Kim Il-sung, proposed allow inspection North Korea's nuclear facilities exchange relief harsh economic sanctions. The hitch Carter announced terms CNN became official, adding gratuitously never agreed sanctions first place. News stories White House seething, Clinton made light spat. He said deal since ratified exchange letters, believe Carter would criticize official policy 'if game still doubt.' [Branch, 162] Haiti: ➢ After pushing sent Haiti enlisting Colin Powell Sam Nunn get WJC break Gore (who said Carter shouldn't trusted second time) Christopher approve mission Haiti seek truce junta, Carter portrayed acting stubbornly 'clientitis' (arguing acceptance Haitian generals versus United States' best interest). He didn't want leave WJC told to. Like North Korea, Carter again, Carter went press first. "The three negotiators flew back Washington late Sunday, Carter, invited stay White House, called CNN's Judy Woodruff midnight arrange interview next morning reported Clinton mission. This conduct, president said tersely, right...The press full retrospective stories friction three prominent negotiators...He said current newsweeklies lapped criticism Carter embarrassment Clinton...Many advisers griped Jimmy Carter thought still president, Clinton found criticism jaundiced. Carter spoken restraint joint press conference, allowed, exhibiting keen political ear...To Clinton, Carter simply felt earned right speak mind international statesman, even mission accepted United States government complete Air Force jet. This sense entitlement could make Carter thorn, Clinton thought value far outweighed political annoyance. He considered Carter sterling ex- resident." [Branch, 200-201] Dispatch Bombers Near Iraq ➢ "He expected military strikes win bipartisan assent, including former presidents Ford, Reagan Bush. 'Dole support me,' said. 'Carter probably criticize me. Carter always criticizes, doesn't much positive say." [Branch, 518] Gore For majority book, little discussion WJC Gore's relationship. There places briefly mentioned couple scenes levity. The end, however, describes seemingly brutally candid conversation two 2000 election impeachment. ➢ On page 92 Branch writes, "No, [Clinton] ask Gore take failed foreign policy, alleged, improve public presentations troika 'bad talkers': shy National Security Adviser Tony Lake, boring Secretary State Warren Christopher, disorganized Defense Secretary Les Aspin." [Branch, 92] ➢ In one-passage WJC talks asking Gore lead independent review Hazel O'Leary also Gore substitute economic conference Japan. The latter fare well nations offended Gore, WJC attended. Gore insisted WJC needed go Japan redeem administration absence. Gore pointed days January, WJC "pronounced vital Chelsea's schoolwork. Gore blinked. So what?...Mutual exasperation spiked. `Al,' Clinton told him, 'I going Japan leave Chelsea take exams.' Gore erupted. He thought Clinton lost bearing. They big fight, said president, still wrangling dates Japan." Branch states fight wound around time WJC saw Lewinsky. [Branch, 316-317] ➢ On page 396-397 scene, shows Gore's sense humor Gore, WJC, et al working team secure Cabinet second term. ➢ Later passage exchange WJC HRC Gore trying hire second criminal lawyer. HRC already knew paying first one $30,000 per month. The conversation leak offer Jim Neal TN, former Watergate prosecutor defend Gore free. The exchange ethics offer leak press Gore. ➢ On Gore's announcing campaign. "The president called twice congratulate Gore kickoff events—once Geneva, hours later Paris. Clinton thought glitches technical... But Gore got big things right. His twofold message perfect: distinguish Clinton's personal flaws, tell voters exactly would White House. The president said fine Gore call Clinton's affair Monica Lewinsky 'inexcusable.' First, true. Second, showed necessary strength criticized boss. Third, Gore would badgered death did. 'Al,' Clinton told him, 'if thought would help campaign, I would let flog noon right doorstep Washington Post.'" [Branch, 553-554] Branch continues WJC told Gore ignore reporting offended critical campaign. "On tape, president said confided chief strategic worry Gore Gore's pollster, Mark Penn. The vice president must project platform—where stood, precisely would lead country—because Republicans would try knock substance." [Branch, 554] ➢ WJC offered critiques Gore's campaign throughout, always framed fear Gore succeeding him. For example, "Clinton still thought Gore could win. Most people considered smart, experience, motivated. He examined pitfalls Gore campaign showcasing presidential character detailed agendas country. Reporters called Gore "stiff," Clinton discounted liability. He thought Gore's droll sense humor would wear well time. Gore also perceived conventional Democrat, therefore lacking independence, called Gore emphasize passion initiatives. Then president said Gore could brooding quality him, worrisome off-putting itself, potentially damaging serious nature failed give voters lifted. Clinton isolated word "sunny." Gore needed it." [Branch, 599] ➢ He also complimented Gore's knowledge government workings. "Gore knew Washington. Believe me, said president, administration would made many errors first two years vice president." He goes say WJC suggested Gore find someone would bright spot run with, perhaps Durbin Bradley Kerrey, although also goes great detail virtues Mikulski, even though would never get chosen. How much WJC's emphasis versus Branch's focus home state senator unclear. [Branch, 599, 618-19] ➢ WJC criticized Gore running successes administration. "They running essentially third term, said president, afraid Clinton-Gore record would tarnish Clinton's character." [Branch, 623] Branch gives WJC's critique Gore debate heard before—that Gore lacked style light touch. ➢ Branch WJC recalling conversation WJC Gore "Gore bared one stressful consultations insisting he, Gore, good politician, elaborating meant good policy, also good politics, admitted instinctively blend two. Gore said think it, Clinton thought pretty close bone...He stuff great president, message Clinton must convey somehow without seeming brag record." [Branch, 623-624] ➢ The big passage Gore begins page 641 extends 645. Branch notes WJC unsure first recording details. At outset says, "For part, Gore angry, blame Clinton defeat, wanted acknowledge forthrightly people around did." [Branch, 642] It WJC acknowledging Gore's use proper—he best White House. Then says, "'I think made mistake use last ten days,'" Clinton told Gore, 'but otherwise big deal. I much upset message, we're honest.'" [Branch, 642] Branch recalls WJC saying Gore fought bag saying "Clinton's drag plagued every direction." Clinton said Gore better governance Clinton, Gore would better nation Bush, "unparalleled" vice president, "blind spots." Branch writes WJC kept saying confrontation "surreal." o Gore "fresh grievance...he wanted Clinton know Buddhist temple fund-raising scandal worst experience life. No one ever questioned personal integrity, corrosive publicity whispers tormented four years. Gore said disposed blame Clinton. However, remembered telling president found English-speaking person one Asian fund-raisers. And president charge party apparatus supposed screen donations trouble. So blame Clinton way. The president told could scarcely believe ensuing tales suspicion. Gore must still shock election, unhinged. 'I thought Neverland,' said." [Branch, 643-644] o Branch continues: "The vice president asked Clinton Monica Lewinsky. He supported Clinton impeachment, publicly privately, declaring disappointed. Yes, said president. He appreciated that. However, persisted Gore, Clinton confide personal feelings. He never explained exactly happened. There little say, Clinton replied, beyond failure regret. He humiliated angry, made mistake. He misled American people, sorry. Gore closed point emphasis. Well, said, first time apologized personally. Clinton double take...Gore treated confession watershed. Their colliding perspectives made angry. Clinton exploded Gore's reaction phony. What significant here?...Gore exploded back. He feeling stubborn repeat defensiveness delayed honesty somehow cost election. Clinton's character root it..." [Branch, 644-45] Other ➢ Maggie Person Recommending Panetta: Unlike My Life, Branch's book, WJC asking Maggie compile confidential suggestions McLarty's replacement. "Williams shrewd, discreet, efficient." [Branch, 161] > HRC Haiti Invasion: Branch asked WJC HRC thought foreign policy team's suggestion invade Haiti. "He said pell-mell rush invade crazy her. Reacting pressure, lack options, sense trapped, said badly served foreign policy staff. He said observed suspicion chief sponsors invasion—Lake, Berger, Talbott—were people pushed ill-fated appointment Bobby Ray Inman defense secretary." [Branch, 189] > ITAV: ITAV co-author flap Sally Quinn spread rumors HRC written book. Quinn said HRC denied credit book's collaborator, Barbara Feinman, friend Quinn. HRC said Feinman withdrawn project. Branch notes White House draft chapters HRC's handwriting. (Branch turned affected ghostwriter.) From HRC said Quinn friends launched rumor HRC female veterinarian Socks' "discovered...in flagrante bedroom floor White House." [Branch, 342-343] > Subpoenas CVC's Friends: Branch tells D'Amato, Chair Banking Committee, subpoenaed might White House HRC's Rose firm records there. This included "some two dozen Chelsea's sleepovers." Senator Sarbanes quashed subpoenas sleepovers. [Branch, 362] ➢ Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex: In context Lewinsky, Branch says Vernon Jordan, "In glancing associations, I picked Vernon attitude toward extramarital sex best described lighthearted recreational." [Branch, 495] > Gore/HRC ticket: "By numbers, Clinton's gut, Gore-Hillary ticket would give Democrats best chance defeat Bush White House. 'Hands down,' [WJC] said, tut I don't think Al would ever it.'" [Branch, 540] > WJC suggesting Rubin run NY Senate seat: The passage comes WJC talks supporting HRC decided run, raises question whether preferred Rubin whether two events unconnected. "When president urged [Rubin] run easily win New York Senate seat, Rubin recoiled...He could fathom Hillary wanted run now..."

I've attached gorgeous cover PDF Hillary's Moment: Clinton Faces World By Joe Klein Time Magazine Wednesday, Nov. 04, 2009 It Halloween night Jerusalem, Benjamin Netanyahu came dressed peacemaker. "We're prepared start peace talks immediately," notoriously reluctant Israeli Prime Minister proclaimed, U.S. Secretary State Hillary Clinton standing side, poker-faced. "I think ... get get it." It ploy, course. The Palestinians tangled themselves, yet again. They elections looming, leader, Mahmoud Abbas, hang tough: demanding total freeze Israeli settlement-building West Bank — precisely Obama Administration previously said favored. Netanyahu offering partial freeze, including new settlements East Jerusalem, desired capital future Palestinian state. This nonstarter Palestinians, holographic glow step forward. It "unprecedented" offer, Netanyahu trumpeted, joy chess master springing trap.(See photos 60 years Israel.) It tough moment Clinton, playing second fiddle Bibi-does-Gandhi show. President Barack Obama softened language settlements weeks earlier: instead total freeze, talked Israeli "restraint" settlement-building. And Clinton seemed cement Administration's retreat, agreeing Netanyahu's proposal was, indeed, "unprecedented," even though U.S. still favored total freeze. The important thing, added, parties get table quickly possible. The onus back Palestinians — Palestinians quickly expressed outrage Obama Administration's retreat. Their Arab neighbors soon joined in, causing Clinton backtrack two days later, telling reporters Israeli plan "falls far short" U.S. expectations, although still insisted calling "unprecedented," neither diplomatic wise. Suddenly Obama Administration seemed wobbly Middle East; clearly, Clinton bullish Netanyahu's proposal (which negotiated months Middle East envoy George Mitchell seen, privately, Americans real progress). But Administration's mission get parties peace talks without preconditions. The Israelis favor talks. The Palestinians setting preconditions. And Clinton violated essential rule job: boring almost always better.(See photos life career former Secretary State Madeleine Albright.) Clinton's Three Qualities For past 40 years, awkward Middle East press conference helped define job Secretary State. You go Jerusalem Ramallah; stand "guardedly optimistic" public; private, try move comma, Israelis Palestinians move, semicolon block comma. The result almost always same: gridlock. The breakthroughs, come, emanate others. Walter Cronkite asks Anwar Sadat he'd willing go Jerusalem ... Sadat, everyone's surprise, says yes. The Israelis Palestinians hold secret meetings Oslo reach appears breakthrough — they're talking! — becomes another dead end. The job Secretary State thankless glamorous; ways, Department State, noble antique, still trying come terms invention telephone. In era Twitter haiku-messaging rules, diplomacy moves speed, requires nuanced complexity, literature. Power drifted State National Security Council Pentagon, especially wartime. Only Clinton's recent predecessors distinguished themselves. Henry Kissinger, National Security Adviser belatedly became Secretary State, Richard Nixon's schizophrenic alter ego; George Shultz strong policy voice Reagan Administration; James Baker clout George H.W. Bush's best friend world-class dealmaker. Most others frustrated forgettable. And yet Hillary Clinton we're talking — second popular American world, eternally compelling supremely talented character, subject constant speculation, walking headline. Her presence job makes crucial more. It cliché say naming Clinton, Obama brought popular potential opponent tent. The conventional wisdom, cynical half, thereby succeeded neutering her, theory bolstered Clinton's reticence first nine months job, special envoys like Mitchell Richard Holbrooke heavy lifting diplomacy. But naming Clinton, Obama also gave great power, cuts ways: becomes dissatisfied role Administration's policies, become torpedo aimed Oval Office. Colin Powell similar power real gripe — Iraq war — never used it. Clinton gripe, Obama Administration settles policy differences begin emerge among key players, Powell conundrum looms: How Clinton choose use power? How Obama react does? Traditionally, Secretary State judged ability formulate policy, negotiate deals manage striped-pants bureaucracy. Clinton history global strategist, although performance 2008 campaign indicates bit conservative President, foreign policy realist Wilsonian idealist. It also early judge skill manager negotiator — although performance Jerusalem indicates needs lessons Middle East Haggling 101. There are, however, three qualities could make memorable Secretary State. She brings vision departmental reform — need elevate foreign aid programs status rigorous scrutiny diplomacy — could change striped pants chinos developing world. She also first elected politician hold office since Edmund Muskie briefly Carter Administration, enabled better understand interact politicians run places like Afghanistan Pakistan. But important, international celebrity much higher profile recent predecessors ability — second President's — change negative attitudes U.S. abroad. She potential become powerful public diplomat U.S. fielded quite time, although performance far, home abroad, occasionally perplexing. At home, often seemed tentative deferential. In conversation Secretary Defense Robert Gates aired CNN early October, Clinton's cautious formality took backseat Gates' brisk, humorous confidence policy issues. Abroad, seems far confident, times point recklessness, Jerusalem. (See photos last days Hillary Clinton's campaign.) Independence Candor In last week October, Secretary Clinton moved squarely center world stage, attempting, behest special envoys, improve rocky alliance Pakistan nudge Middle East pugilists talks. In course trip, first stray wisps hint Clinton wanted begin asserting independence, Administration, facing roadblocks across world, struggled firmer foreign policy tone opening nine months might called Rodney King — "Can't get along?" — phase. During three days Pakistan, ran gauntlet town-hall meetings media interviews may unprecedented, use word week, U.S. Secretary State. The trip, planned Holbrooke Pakistan specialist Vali Nasr, offered unusually subtle itinerary U.S. diplomatic mission. A visit Sufi mosque bombed Sunni extremists, example, sent powerful message Pakistan's moderate Islamic majority. "We saw praying there," academic named Shala Aziz told me, "and, first time, I'm thinking, The Americans hearts."(See photos suicide bombings Islamabad.) The big news Clinton allowed hammered hostile questions students, talk-show hosts Pashturi elders -- that, occasion, pushed back, raising incredibly sensitive issues, like one Pakistani government knew Osama bin Laden was, even though country since 2002. Press accounts either emphasized embarrassment Secretary State's getting pummeled fixed Clinton's undiplomatic bluntness. But missed point: candor, willingness listen acknowledge criticism, begun undermine prevailing Pakistani image U.S. arrogant bossy, interested Pakistani military fight war al-Qaeda Taliban true strategic partnership. The contrast especially sharp George W. Bush's eight years unqualified support military dictatorship Pervez Musharraf. "In past, Americans came, would talk generals go home," said Farahnaz Ispahani, government spokeswoman Member Parliament. "Clinton's willingness meet everyone, hostile not, made big impression — she's Hillary Clinton, real history affinity country, means much more." Transformative Experience There toasts state dinners Pakistan, alcohol. There opening statements, though, Clinton's — delivered impromptu first night trip tossing aside notes — surprisingly emotional. Earlier day, President Asif Ali Zardari, widower Benazir Bhutto, presented Secretary album photos first visit Pakistan, 1995, framed photo Bhutto two sons Clinton daughter Chelsea. "It bring tears eyes," Clinton said state dinner honor presidential palace, "because I admired wife. She gave life ..." She faltered then, choking up, quickly pulled together, talking "reasons — provide opportunities all." Clinton's first trip Pakistan First Lady 1995 transformative experience — beginning, I believe, the•process made plausible candidate Secretary State. I traveled trip; set off, seemed depressed even private usual. The Democrats cratered 1994 congressional elections, trounced efforts enact universal health care plan. It personal defeat; Clinton traveled country trying sell plan, crowds shouted cursed her. Privately admitted shocked hatred. The trip South Asia seemed bit vacation — Chelsea's spring break — also retreat demure, First Lady–like role two years health care policy czar, although proceeded decidedly wonky, Hillarian fashion. Jackie Kennedy gone India famously ridden elephant; Hillary Clinton traveled five countries packed schedule visits NGOs. "That greatest trip, unbelievable," Clinton says now. We sitting hotel suite day Jerusalem gaffe, Secretary electric-blue shift rather usual formal jacket pants. She wearing glasses appeared rather freckly without makeup. "I guess trip animated informed everything I've done since," said. She emerged trip reinvigorated, new mission. By end 1995, U.N. Conference Women Beijing, First Lady propounded new Clinton Doctrine: "Women's rights human rights."(See photos Beijing's changing skyline.) Clinton easy interview. She preternaturally cautious, consequence Methodist propriety 20 years insane public scrutiny. She like talk herself, tell one interesting story Bhutto. When husband governor Arkansas, Bill Chelsea visited London stood sidewalk outside Bhutto's hotel, waiting Pakistani Prime Minister arrive. "She wearing yellow embroidered shalwar kameez chiffon scarf. I fan, standing sidewalk everyone else. It time I ever anything like that," Clinton says. When Clinton Bhutto met formally, first day 1995 trip, hit immediately, part Bhutto also obsessed impact Islamist tide women children. I remember asking Bhutto day biggest change country past 25 years, said, "I used able walk street wearing jeans, without headscarf. Now I can't." When I asked why, said — bluntly — "The Saudis," aggressively funding religious schools. Of course, Bhutto's acquiescence to, participation in, general corruption Pakistani government part reason public schools inadequate madrasahs became popular. (See photos aftermath Benazir Bhutto's assassination 2007.) Ironically, rise Sunni extremist groups like al-Qaeda brought Clinton's interests — microfinance, education health care — center national-security policy first time. The impetus came State Department military, counterinsurgency doctrine demanded social services war zones - schools, justice, economic development — reinforce military's efforts secure population. As result, immediate chemistry Clinton General David Petraeus, author Army's counterinsurgency manual, became one prime military mentors served Senate Armed Services Committee. At one point, well Obama made presidential intentions known, I asked Petraeus potential Democratic candidate understood mind worked, said, "You mean, aside Hillary?" It Clinton brought together Petraeus Holbrooke ("my two alpha males," calls them) first time - home Washington Friday Obama Inauguration. The affection respect gained military serving Senate helped make relationship State Pentagon less fraught usual — although Defense Secretary Gates' insistence need bigger State Department budgets hasn't hurt. In fact, relations Pentagon gone smoother, times, Clinton's relationship White House staff. Clinton particularly irritated ridiculously strict vetting process thwarted favored candidate USAID director, Paul Farmer, getting job. "It sorts niggling things," says Clinton adviser, "like, Farmer one point brought $10,000 cash Haiti. The money needle-exchange program, amount illegal." Another Clinton's military mentors, retired General Jack Keane, told me, "I'm Republican. I disagree practically everything, she'd make hell Commander Chief." There palpable toughness woman, hard edge contrasts President's instinctive impulse toward conciliation. One sharpest exchanges presidential campaign came Obama accused Clinton echoing "bluster" George W. Bush said U.S. would able "obliterate" Iran used nuclear weapons Israel. Clinton's edgier tone evident start Administration: took sharper position President Israeli settlement freeze claiming, May, Obama wanted "to see stop settlements. Not settlements, outposts, natural-growth exceptions." And then, Jerusalem, use word unprecedented seemed rhetorical leap beyond No Drama ground rules.(Read "Clinton's Collateral Damage.") The White House entirely thrilled either statement. But White House staff several steps removed negotiating process. The Palestinians weak divided. The Israelis difficult, always: whenever Mitchell raises East Jerusalem talks Israeli Foreign Minister, Israeli stands walks room. Despite Netanyahu's momentary, tactical enthusiasm peace talks, Likud Party always favored de facto incorporation Palestinian lands state Israel. Hillary's Choice The tensions White House State raise fascinating question going forward. Obama Clinton substantive agreement President's diplomacy-first philosophy policy issues — although neither willing disclose content private conversations — style often predicts substance foreign policy; neither Obama's gauziness Clinton's inconsistent bluntness overseas seems particularly solid. There growing perception Administration's policies thwarted across board: Afghanistan mess, Iran seems ready scuttle nuclear negotiations, there's progress Middle East, Syrians North Koreans remain recalcitrant, Russians offered freebie missile defense, Chinese given pass human rights apparent quid pro quos. The White House argues progress made: Iran defensive, North Korea said return six-party talks. Clinton argues, correctly, need "strategic patience." But thing Obama really show efforts far Nobel Prize Potential — small thing — wisdom refrained anything wildly stupid invading Iraq. The President willing use military force - Predator drones decimated al-Qaeda's leadership testify lack squeamishness — Administration supposed efficacy using subtler expressions of.U.S. power. That doesn't happen overnight, Obama's policies considered success, happen sooner later, way explained public. There also growing sense President's inexperience beginning show — overall policy, represents views broad, moderate national-security consensus ranging Brent Scowcroft John Kerry, execution details. The Afghan strategy review public taken long; Middle East peace hunt become wild goose chase. A letter Iran's Supreme Leader productive gesture gets response; doesn't, seems weak supplicatory. A call Israelis freeze settlements effective accompanied credible threat reduction aid. "You can't seen pushing countries around — demanding [that] Israel freeze settlements, demanding Hamid Karzai reform government — get results," says Leslie H. Gelb, author Power Rules. "The leaders countries tough, successful politicians, they'll begin take less seriously." (See photos 1979 revolution Iran.) Clinton unwilling acknowledge problems, staff loath admit occasional mistakes. Her praise President fulsome, aides say relationship Obama really — really — strong. But also burblings emanations Clinton's staff friends, Foggy Bottom body language, suggest need Administration produce second act Rodney King phase. And White House perplexed uncharacteristic lack discipline indicated Clinton's occasional overseas gaffes. These tensions well within boundaries normal, creative policymaking. There absolutely indication Secretary frustrated point jumping ship — returning politics candidate governor New York, rumored. Quite contrary, seems intent making history Secretary State. To that, though, authority home abroad. She become President's primary foreign policy voice. Over first nine months Obama Administration, seven different Obama officials spoken Sunday talk shows foreign policy. Clinton Sunday shows once. "Either one person sending foreign policy message, clear approval President," says former Republican Secretary State, "or message."(See photos eight months Obama's diplomacy.) Aides Obama say would like see Sunday shows often. (Indeed, Clinton's staff acknowledged asked appear two additional times traveling unable so.) Ultimately, though, television metaphor larger questions need resolved: How much former rivals — extremely guarded private people — really trust other; and, Clinton, emerge President's alter ego foreign policy? At point, strongest member Obama's national-security team Gates — he's Republican unlikely spokesman presidential confidant anything beyond Pentagon issues. General Jim Jones settled National Security Adviser, he's political animal — every President needs close foreign policy adviser understands intersection long-term strategy, politics diplomatic chess. Clinton's value Administration clear Pakistan. She wowed public skeptical questioning $7.5 billion purely economic humanitarian aid Administration promised. "How much damage control able trip?" asked Meher Bokhari, television-news-show host, end Clinton's meeting Pakistani women. The Secretary seemed nonplussed bluntness question. "I don't know," said. "I hope some." Afterward, I asked Bokhari answer question. "Well, trip long overdue," said. "The Pakistani people really needed talk American concerns — strings attached aid programs, drone attacks, history support military dictatorship. And needs followed up. But ask damage control" — paused, thinking — "I'd say lot. She accomplished lot." In end, though, Clinton's success determined whether expand role beyond public diplomat. She become sure-handed negotiator and, important, trusted adviser President knows wants go world hasn't quite figured get there.

That's Vice President Joe Biden, who's currently next line presidency. According poll, 28 percent Americans say Palin qualified run White House, seven 10 saying former Alaska governor 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee qualified. The survey indicates majority Republicans, 54 percent, feel Palin qualified, 44 percent indicating isn't. But 29 percent independent voters questioned feel qualified serve president, 68 percent disagreeing. According poll, nine 10 Democrats feel Palin qualified. The poll's release comes one day release Palin's book, "Going Rogue: An American Life." "The perception Palin qualified president puts significantly behind two potential rivals GOP nomination 2012 - Mitt Romney Mike Huckabee," says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. According survey, nearly half Americans think Romney qualified president, 43 percent feeling way Huckabee. Among Republicans, Palin still lagging potential 2012 primary candidates: 63 percent GOPers think Romney Huckabee qualified, 9 points higher number say Palin." Palin many strengths - recent CNN polls indicate Americans believe typical politician, cares average Americans, honest trustworthy," says Holland. "But perception qualified White House biggest Achilles heel."An ABC News/Washington Post poll also released Monday indicates 38 percent Americans say Palin's qualified serve president, six 10 saying she's qualified. The CNN survey indicates 67 percent people questioned say Clinton qualified serve Oval Office, 17 points higher 50 percent Americans think Biden's qualified take president.Biden's low number may attributable negative feelings Obama/Biden administration rather views Biden personally."

Hillary Clinton also advantage able stay domestic policy debates, including health care, economic stimulus, controversial matters, adding almost daily experience foreign policy, Holland adds, Biden involved domestic policy disputes - "which might explain respondents looking reason say something negative veep."

Do need kill save it? BY MATTHEW ARMSTRONG I SEPTEMBER 11, 2009 Discussion fate Foggy Bottom usually focuses tenure Secretary State Hillary Clinton, troubles public diplomacy, rise special envoys everything European pipelines Afghanistan Pakistan. But Americans would benefit reassessment core functionality U.S. State Department. Years neglect marginalization, well dearth long-term vision strategic planning, left 19th- century institution hamstrung fiefdoms bureaucratic bottlenecks. The Pentagon funds controls wide range foreign-policy diplomatic priorities -- development public diplomacy beyond. The world changed, everyone politicians talking heads terrorists directly influencing global audiences. The pressing issues stateless: pandemics, recession, terrorism, poverty, proliferation, conflict. But report report, investigation investigation, highlighted, State Department broken paralyzed, unable respond new 21st-century paradigm. But get bad? Is possible fix? Or push wall like great Humpty Dumpty reassign pieces? There growing evidence internal machinations State Department corrupted "core missions" traditional diplomacy public diplomacy. This year, example, Government Accountability Office (gao) found department completely failed four-year-old attempt reorganize nonproliferation bureau (a bureau remains leaderless). Besides failing address mission overlap, low morale, lack career opportunities, failed reorganization caused significant drop expertise offices focused proliferation issues -- including "today's threats posted Iran, North Korea, Syria," gao's report said -- coordination bodies like International Atomic Energy Agency. Another report State Department's inspector general year described severe broad dysfunction within Africa bureau, ignoring -- perhaps considering given -- lack departmentwide integration leadership operations. Examples dysfunction range providing public diplomacy personnel computers capable reading interoffice memos failure effectively work new Africa Command. By necessity, Defense Department stepped State Department tuned out: Foggy Bottom relies Pentagon funding even personnel basic operations central mission. For example, Defense Department performs much strategic communications work traditionally purview State Department. In Somalia, example, State Department's budget public diplomacy $30,000. The Pentagon's $600,000. And, State Department's bureaucratic wisdom, $30,000 even belong undersecretary public diplomacy public affairs. Further, rivalries different "cones" -- career tracks, referred one insider "conal caste system" -- State Department severely impact morale, career growth, even operations. The report Africa bureau noted 2002, public affairs public diplomacy "failed office" -- situation worse 2009. Public outreach workers said bureau's leadership "does understand public diplomacy." The sentiment widespread. A 2008 report congressional ombudsman, U.S. Advisory Commission Public Diplomacy, described systemic failure support train public diplomacy officers field, well professional discrimination career track. Attempts fix State Department focused short-term issues, ameliorating shortages human financial resources. The last eight secretaries state attempted bolster department bolstering bottom line. No less Defense Secretary Robert Gates chairman Joint Chiefs Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, long suggested transferring funds Defense Department State Department. But situation dire State Department, point, could even absorb spend much-needed infusion cash. If wholesale transfer funds tomorrow, lack capacity skills State department would mean would give back Defenk Department dole contractors. The creeping militarization U.S. foreign policy deeply worrying, Gates Mullen, also luminaries Secretary Clinton Vice President Joe Biden. In 2008, then-Senator Biden questioned "expanding role military U.S. foreign policy." He said concerned "migration functions authorities U.S. civilian agencies Department Defense." Some commentators even wondered aloud whether best way fix State Department might destroy it. Foggy Bottom could retain small core staff embassies ambassadors. All functions -- public diplomacy, countering misinformation propaganda, development, including provincial reconstruction staffing -- could migrate Pentagon become wholly independent agencies. But atomizing State Department would ultimately prove dangerous militarization foreign policy. The Pentagon needs counterbalance, vertically integrated State Department president, Congress, U.S. public count on. Change, rather creative destruction, Foggy Bottom needs. Envision State Department capable leading whole-of-government initiatives strategic focus instead one hidebound department geared structure tradition execute state-to-state diplomacy. This "Department State Non-State" would deft tackling stateless terrorist networks hurricanes would fostering upholding alliances foreign ministers. To transform Foggy Bottom way require breaking rigid hierarchy, stovepipes, bottlenecks make Pentagon look lean dynamic comparison. Modern global affairs compartmentalized political borders. Besides expanding overly shallow narrow authorities public diplomacy bureau, Clinton must restructure State Department focus less countries regions. Currently, Foggy Bottom's regional bureaus, Near East Affairs, configured oversee patch embassies. Country desk officers, ambassadors, report assistant secretary, regional head. The assistant secretary turn reports undersecretary, reports Clinton. Clinton name regional bureau heads, currently assistant secretaries, undersecretary status. This would help eliminate unnecessary bureaucratic layer would also align State Department Defense Department (which powerful regional commands, Centcom Africom). The State Department's regional leaders would hold equivalent civilian rank four-star combatant commanders like Gen. David Petraeus. These changes would promise improve communications, synchronize missions, put department right path today's requirements. But Clinton beware reforming State Department quickly within -- efforts could paralyzed bureaucracy mutiny would simply wait out. U.S. national security would suffer Pentagon's growing power would become entrenched. Clinton need clear unequivocal support president importantly Congress, authorizes State Department spending bills, chance success. In burst activity Barack Obama's election, Congress authorized money people State Department pushed greater public diplomacy. Still required. The question asked last eight years State Department abrogated various responsibilities -- Defense, who? -- not, indeed cannot, answered department steps plate becomes effective visible leading implementing U.S. foreign policy. This take time. But, saying goes, time like present. The United States Congress supports change, secretaries state defense want change, president whose entire election platform built around word "change," American public would outraged dysfunction knew details. 3

Cheryl Mills < Sunday, December 6, 2009 9:39 PM Fwd: Charles Blow NYT today EF1 December 5, 2009 Op-Ed Columnist Black Age Obama By CHARLES M. BLOW A hundred fifty years ago, Charles Dickens opened "A Tale Two Cities" now-famous phrase: "It best times, worst times. ..." Those words resonated recently contemplating impact Obama presidency blacks America. So far, it's mixed. Blacks living tale two Americas — one ascension first black president cultural capital accrues; collapsing quality life amplified racial tensions, supporting president loath even acknowledge pain, let alone commiserate it. Last year, blacks dared dream anew, envisioning future Obama's election would catalyst era prosperity racial harmony. Now election's afterglow nearly faded, hysteria hope ground hard stone reality. Things gotten better. In many ways, they've gotten worse. The recession, one, dealt particularly punishing uneven hand blacks. A May report Pew Research Center found blacks likely get higher-priced subprime loans, leading higher foreclosure rates. In fact, blacks displaced Hispanics group lowest homeownership rates. According recent jobs data, unemployment rate blacks nearly twice whites, gap important demographics widened rapidly since Obama took office. The unemployment rate time white college graduates 24 years old grew 20 percent. For black cohorts, rate grew twice much. And report published last month Department Agriculture found 2008, "food insecurity" American households risen record levels, black children likely experience food insecurity. Things racial front bad. We inundated examples overt racism scale unaccustomed. Any protester racist poster hijack news cycle, racist image live forever Internet. In fact, racially offensive images first couple prolific online Google runs apologetic ad results image searches them. And it's words images; it's actions well. According Federal Bureau Investigation's 2008 hate crimes data released last week, anti-black hate crimes rose 4 percent 2007, combined hate crimes racial categories declined 11 percent. If look two-year trend, would include Obarna's ascension candidate, anti-black hate crimes risen 8 percent, racial groups fallen 19 percent. This sobering effect blacks. According Nov. 9 report Gallup, last summer 23 percent blacks thought race relations would get lot better election Obama. Now less half percentage says things actually gotten lot better. The racial animosity Obama's election stirred may contributed rallying effect among blacks. According Gallup report published Nov. 24, Obama's approval rating among whites dropped 39 percent, among blacks remains 90 percent. Also, hasn't exactly good year black men news. Plaxico Burress locked accidentally shooting gun club. Henry Louis Gates Jr. locked intentionally shooting mouth home. And Michael Jackson died shot full propofol. Chris Brown brutally beat Rihanna. Former Representative William Jefferson convicted. And recently, "personal failings" Tiger Woods portray alley cat. Meanwhile, critically acclaimed black movie year, "Precious," features black man rapes twice impregnates daughter. Rooting president feels like nice counterbalance. However, rallying creates conundrum blacks: air anxiety without arming Obama's enemies. This dilemma rendered blacks virtually voiceless pressing issues time voices would presumably held greater sway. This means Obama get away almost nothing specifically address issues important African-Americans instead focus white voters he's losing droves. This gone unnoticed. In Nov. 9 Gallup poll, number blacks felt Obama would go far enough promoting efforts aid black community jumped 60 percent last summer now. The hard truth Obama needs white voters needs black ones. According analysis, even every black person America stayed home Election Day, Obama would still president. To large degree, Obama elected white people, able accept consciously portrayed racially ambiguous. In fact, commiserating blacks could prove politically problematic. In study published journal Proceedings National Academy Sciences month, researchers asked subjects rate images president determine ones best represented "true essence." In photos, skin lightened. In others, darkened. The result? The people identified "whiter" images, likely voted him, vice versa. The Age Obama, far least, seems less Obama black community game-changer White House gamesman. It's unclear positive Obama Effect, Obama Backlash increasingly apparent. Meanwhile, black people also living tale two actions: grin bear it. Forwarded message

I've asked Todd identify specific areas thinks progress made discussions Thursday. At high level, I think leaders' conversations Thursday begin narrow gaps big issues -- transparency, funding, inscribing commitments, etc -- IF (and it's big if) gaps narrow-able. If they're not, Thursday/Friday days trying failing ... least trying. Todd's view enough time Friday top-level meetings close deal; two days required. You would head delegation first, POTUS second.

Now wish add improved economic security climate meaningful political negotiations. I already said build new settlements would expropriate additional land existing settlements.

Politico Poll: Clinton approval soars By: Eamon Javers December 16, 2009 03:00 PM EST A new poll avid news watchers shows Secretary State Hillary Clinton much higher approval rating man campaigned works for, President Barack Obama. In poll 800 registered voters self-identified "news watchers," Clinton 75 percent approval rating 21 percent disapproval rating overall. Obama, contrast, 51 percent approval 45 percent disapproval rating. The Secretary State conducted several well-received foreign trips recent months closely identified contentious elements Administration's agenda, including health care fight, federal deficit Wall Street bailouts. And subjected nearly media partisan scrutiny president. Obama, meanwhile, national television daily basis tackling wide range difficult issues. The poll conducted nonpartisan Clarus Research Group December 7th 12th, asked opinions top Cabinet secretaries White House officials. Its finding Obama Clinton mirrors earlier polls — October, example, Gallup poll found Clinton become popular president. Clarus president Ron Faucheux said one reason Clinton's high poll numbers high approval among Republicans — numbers said position well run president future, chooses. Clinton 96 percent approval among Democrats, healthy 57 percent approval among Republicans, 65 percent approval among Independents. Obama nearly popular among Democrats — 93 percent — numbers among Republicans Independents fell dramatically, 19 percent 33 percent respectively. Clinton's Republican numbers striking, given intensely disliked past among GOP voters. In fact, part Obama's appeal Democratic primary voters 2008 likely able bridge partisan divide Clinton, well-known figure dating time first lady 1990s. "Republicans may see hawkish Democrats foreign policy issues," said Faucheux. "It may way bolster position within administration." Asked future Clinton presidential bid, said, "She's good shape now." The next highest-rated cabinet secretary survey Defense Secretary Robert Gates, notched 69 percent overall approval rate 78 percent approval among Democrats 63 percent among Republicans independents. "Both Clinton Gates well across partisan board," said Faucheux. "Everybody else well among Democrats fell among Republicans." Another trend spotted pollsters: Approval ratings inside Beltway higher rest country. "These results show 'Beltway echo chamber' reflect rest country, even among news watchers," said Faucheux. Among White House staffers advisors, Press Secretary Robert Gibbs — often seen television — highest overall rating 50 percent. Economic advisor Larry Summers lowest approval, 25 percent. Summers Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner — closely associated economy — posted higher disapproval numbers approval. Summers' disapproval rating 41 percent. Geithner's disapproval rating 45 percent, one point higher approval rating. The poll also found White House Chief Staff Rahm Emanuel, often viewed sharp partisan elbows, scored much higher among Democrats, 72 percent, Republicans, 13 percent. Among major administration officials, Vice President Joe Biden 50 percent approval 41 percent disapproval rating; Attorney General Eric Holder HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius posted 41 percent approval 35 percent disapproval; Presidential Adviser David Axelrod scored 38 percent approval 36 percent disapproval; National Security Adviser James Jones 30 percent approval 23 percent disapproval rating.

Levin opposed surge, voted funding troops. Pasted Levin's speech troops Afghanistan. We'll copy well. Afghan speech FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE September 11, 2009 Contact: Senator Levin's Office Phone: 202.224.6221 Senate Floor Speech - Surge Afghan Army Remarks prepared delivery Today mark solemn anniversary. Eight years ago morning, nation attacked terrorist extremists motivated hatred bent destruction. It always appropriate remember shock day, innocent lives lost, efforts nation made since day ensure Afghanistan, nation hosted terrorists, cannot become safe haven terrorists seeking attack us. But today especially appropriate occasion take stock efforts, consider best continue them. I recently returned trip Afghanistan, I joined colleagues Senators Jack Reed Ted Kaufman. The situation Afghanistan serious. Security deteriorated. But take right steps, ensure Afghanistan revert Taliban-friendly government could provide safe haven al Qaeda terrorize us world. The Obama administration's new strategy, focusing securing Afghan population's safety partnering Afghan security forces effort, important start reversing situation Afghanistan. The change strategy led forces, words General McChrystal's Counterinsurgency Guidance, "live, eat train together [with Afghan security forces], plan operate together, depend one another, hold accountable....and treat equal partners success." The Guidance goes say success Afghan security forces "is goal." To achieve goal increase accelerate efforts support Afghan security forces efforts become self-sufficient delivering security nation — consider whether increase U.S. combat forces levels already planned next months. These steps include increasing size Afghan Army police much faster presently planned; providing trainers Afghan Army police presently planned; providing equipment presently planned; working separate local Taliban fighters leaders attract side government Iraq. While security situation Afghanistan worsened, still important advantages there. The Afghan people hate Taliban. Public opinion polls show support Taliban 5%. In addition, Afghan army highly motivated troops proven fighters. Despite advantages, face significant challenges. General McChrystal believes, I agree, need regain initiative create momentum towards success. General McChrystal worries, rightly so, perception lost initiative, impact perception Afghan people, government, al Qaeda Taliban. By contrast, dispel perception, chance convince local lower- level Taliban fighters lay arms rejoin Afghan society. I believe effective way retake initiative Afghanistan series steps ensure Afghanistan's army police manpower, equipment support secure nation. First, increase troop levels Afghan army police faster currently planned. There approximately 90,000 troops Afghan army now, number scheduled go 134,000 October 2010. The Afghan police scheduled reach level 82,000 time. For long time, many us urged establishment goal 240,000 Afghan troops 160,000 Afghan police 2013. The Afghan Minister Defense strongly supported numbers. It appears government Afghan government prepared accept goals. But need additional Afghan forces urgent. I believe possible essential advance goals year, 2012. Our military Afghanistan repeatedly pointed need Afghan forces. In one sector Helmand province visited last week, Marines outnumbered Afghan soldiers 5 one. A Marine Company commander Helmand province told New York Times July lack Afghan troops "is absolutely Achilles heel." What need increase size Afghan army police? According Afghan Defense Minister Wardak, lack Afghan manpower; we've assured available. But need significantly trainers. We asked General Formica, charge American effort train Afghan security forces, whether increase possible. He indicated would make assessment would necessary order meet earlier timetable. In meantime, also press NATO allies much greater forcefulness provide trainers. If NATO allies going come combat forces pledged, least could provide additional trainers. Larger Afghan security forces also require mid-level Afghan officers. In addition supporting efforts graduate Afghan officers army academies, consider recommendation Defense Minister Wardak previous mid-level officers fought war Soviets return service interim basis. Minister Wardak emphasized men well qualified well motivated, may trained current tactics, nonetheless could temporarily meet need enlarged army new group officers trained. A larger Afghan force need supporting infrastructure, barracks. While available infrastructure may modern, adequate exists sufficient amounts. Larger Afghan security forces require additional equipment. There must major effort transfer significant amount equipment coming Iraq Afghan army police. Such significant commitment equip Afghan security forces would also help demonstrate U.S. determination take initiative create momentum right direction. There enormous amount equipment coming Iraq; military calling one greatest transfers military goods world's history. A significant part could transferred Afghan forces, increasing capability without weakening readiness. And yet seem kind crash effort place that. We need obtain urgent basis list basic equipment needs Afghan forces list needs could met major program transfer equipment leaving Iraq. Rapidly expanding Afghanistan's military police forces would address one major problems risks face there. General McChrystal told us worries waiting 2013 larger Afghan force creates gap capabilities brings significant risk failure. But accelerating training equipping Afghan forces year, address concern. Depending additional capability Afghan, rather U.S., forces, also addresses major problem public perception Afghanistan. The larger military footprint there, enemies seek drive wedge us Afghan population, spreading falsehood seek dominate Muslim nation. Finally, make concerted effort separate local Taliban leaders. In Iraq, large numbers young Iraqis attacking us switched side became "Sons Iraq." They drawn part promise jobs amnesty past attacks, part recognition status quo creating horrific violence communities. In interests interests nation, switched sides became positive force. That prospect exists Afghanistan. Afghan leaders military say local Taliban fighters motivated largely need job loyalty local leader pays ideology religious zeal. They believe effort attract fighters government's side could succeed, offered security families, penalty previous activity us. General McChrystal emphasized potential re-integration accomplish result achieved Iraq. Here General McChrystal said July 28th: "Most fighters see Afghanistan Afghans, foreign cadre them. But don't see deeply ideological even politically motivated; operating pay; commander's charismatic leadership; frustrated local leaders. So I believe significant potential go I would call mid- low-level Taliban fighters leaders offer re-integration Afghanistan constitution." But "game changing" possibility apparently factored General McChrystal's assessment. There plan yet put place Sons Iraq approach Afghanistan. It urgent lay steps need taken involve local national Afghan leaders effort. They alone accomplish crucial job, first Afghan allies must draft plan urgent basis. And potential positive impact plan taken account consider need additional U.S. military resources. Afghanistan's people grateful aid, also eager assume responsibility future. In tiny village Helmand Province, invited meet village elders council meeting, shura. One hundred men sat floor chatted us future country's future. When asked long United States stay, one elder said: "Until moment make security forces self-sufficient. Then welcome visit us, soldiers guests." Helping Afghanistan achieve self-sufficiency security everybody's goal. On little difference opinion, Afghanistan's village councils corridors Capitol. Can help Afghanistan reach self-sufficiency security fast enough? Can get way regains initiative creates momentum need? Can encourage lower level Taliban abandon insurgency headed terrorists whose fanaticism don't share? I believe can, supporting far rapid growth Afghan Army police; providing trainers quickly; rapid infusion Afghan units equipment longer needed Iraq; rapidly adopting plan re-integration lower level Taliban fighters Afghan society. In words, need surge Afghan security forces. Our support surge show commitment success mission clearly national security interest, without creating bigger U.S. military footprint provides propaganda fodder Taliban. I believe taking steps urgent basis, completing previously planned announced increase U.S. combat forces, provides best chance success mission: preventing Afghanistan run Taliban government harbors supports Al-Qaeda, whose goal inflict additional catastrophic attacks United States world. And implement steps considering increase U.S. ground combat forces beyond already planned end year.

Why Lady Ashton take EU's foreign policy job? • Jan 26th 2010, 22:04 NOT yet February, briefing Catherine Ashton, newly appointed EU foreign policy chief, getting nasty.

It important politically within DUP, also externally since become symbol whether achieved something compromised much. Adams SF moved far original positions parades, adding Robinson also moved. The DUP linkage timeframes devolution parades Robinson's goal DUP deputy party leader Nigal Dodds. Logistically, linkage would impossible without delaying devolution given parades framework requires consultation, legislation, implementation.

To rebuild Haiti, start young people A 700,000-strong national civic service corps would harness untapped labor rapidly instill national pride confidence. By Robert Muggah Robert Maguire January 31, 2010 Haiti need big ideas recover rebuild aftermath devastating magnitude 7.0 earthquake month. The reported death toll topped 150,000, reconstruction needs incalculable. How starting 700,000-strong national civic service corps made Haitian youth? There many reasons entity makes lot sense. Haiti young country. An estimated 70% population 30; 15-to-29 segment alone makes 50% population. Demographers long cautioned excessively youthful populations potentially exacerbate underdevelopment accentuate political instability. Although Haiti registers among lowest levels education Western Hemisphere, Haitian youth wellspring creativity, talent potential. You don't need community-development specialist know stifled lack meaningful opportunities. Fortunately, Haiti enabling environment set civic service corps. Article 52 Haitian Constitution commits citizens national service, though never activated. What more, many Haitian international organizations mobilized ready help government get going. A civic service corps would get young able tent cities around Port-au-Prince work. They could start once-iconic center capital, also could begin planting trees, working fields providing services Haiti's countryside. At minimum, would reverse generations unfair stigmatizing youth there. This plan would also harness untapped labor rapidly. Before Jan. 12 earthquake, 50% youth 20s work. Putting service toward rebuilding capital outlying areas would first step restoring country's pride dignity. A civic service corps would also multiply international efforts promote recovery world moves next crisis. Hundreds humanitarian agencies, donor governments nongovernmental organizations facing monumental challenges coordinating relief assistance. Although everyone involved committed rapid disbursement, transaction costs monumental. A civic service corps would allow rapid form transferring capital. Direct support corps would inject serious liquidity Haitian economy stimulate recovery bottom up. Rather food-for-work schemes, international best practice recommends proposals promote direct monetary transfers beneficiaries. Haitian youth families urgent needs don't need paternalistic programs curb choices. With proper oversight financial safeguards, civic service corps would circumvent unnecessary administrative costs. Further, civic service corps would restore national pride confidence Haitian public institutions. During past decades, state provided relatively services Haitians, particularly outside capital. In cases, state entities downright predatory. As result, nonstate providers, including gangs shady middlemen, filled gap. A civic service corps -- wearing Haitian colors acting first responders organizations demonstrating government's presence ground -- would show government serious supporting citizens. It would symbolic first step toward renewing social contract people. A civic service corps also makes sense long-term risk emergency planning. Haiti situated path hurricanes fault line, expect disasters. Training 700,000 young people -- especially young women -- basics first aid, emergency response, community policing skills would greatly mitigate consequences future calamities. With disciplined training management, corps could provide intensive training specialized areas -- engineering, telecommunications public health. An initial step getting Haiti's youth work could include preparation road map future meetings Haiti, including U.N. donor conference scheduled March. Any final plan would need draw invaluable experiences ongoing efforts mobilize youth Haiti. These include work Brazilian nongovernmental organization Viva Rio supporters. Before earthquake, Viva Rio Brazilian peacekeepers recruited trained hundreds Haitian youth, including former gang members, provide relief services Haiti's slums. This program could reactivated scaled quickly. A civic service corps could draw lessons groups target recruit youths for, say, two years. The Haitian government would, course, need one manage undertaking, direct oversight president's office Interior Ministry. And many countries could provide advice support. Nongovernmental groups private donors could also play key role mobilizing support transferring essential skills. Haiti's youth future nation, central Haiti's recovery. A civic service corps large-scale way quickly mobilize act catalyst long-term, progressive changes.

Revised human rights draft faxed Chappaqua. You next minutes.
Philippe Jake asked send along response Washington Post editorial: By Michael Posner The Post's Dec. 27 editorial ("Redefining Human Rights") Obama Administration's human rights democracy policies, Secretary Clinton's recent speech Georgetown particular, misses critical point: human rights, democracy, development mutually reinforcing, competing goals. They complement task making human rights human reality. President Roosevelt understood fundamental link liberty, prosperity security, tying together freedom speech worship freedom want freedom fear famous "Four Freedoms" speech. At Georgetown, Secretary Clinton articulated 21st century vision grounded wisdom. To accuse Secretary Clinton embracing Soviet-bloc approach human rights includes development discussion democracy strains bonds credulity common sense, also walls crucial avenue ensuring people actually exercise rights naturally - including rights freedom religion, association, speech-in daily lives. As Secretary Clinton made clear, policies address development alone adequate: "Freedom doesn't come half measures, partial remedies solve whole problem," said. But experience shows us broad-based development occurs, people likely demand say securing futures, governments likely resources maintain strong institutions, including reliable police fair courts, help ensure consistent protection rights. Where people given right speak freely, participate nation's political process access basic information government, sustainable development likely occur. At time, democracies without development last. These mutually reinforcing tracks, Obama Administration committed pursuing simultaneously. As President Obama said Nobel lecture, "engagement repressive regimes lacks satisfying purity indignation." But Post's overheated outrage ignores lessons learned generations men women worked advance human rights around world. To suggest Secretary Clinton somehow provided excuses rights-abusing dictators speech forcefully criticized specific abuses across world, simply credible. Far excuse regime, approach pushes governments advance civil political rights ensure democracy actually delivers measure prosperity opportunity all. That right approach Obama Administration 21st century. ###
Great. We're reaching now.

See report below: Pinera announced support. I long conversation Craig little ago. He spoke number people Chile, including close friend, According Craig, Pinera made calculation would politically untenable dump Insulza. Apparently coalition leadership lower house, Insulza's party, Concertacion, controls upper house. So choice. That said, Craig believes clear message impact Pinera told Insulza. He apparently gave support two conditions: (1) don't interfere Chilean politics, (2) take democratization agenda seriously don't carry ALBA countries' water. Craig also said Arturo effective making clear jury Insulza Washington -- impact Pinera government reinforced second message him. Bottom line: Craig said couldn't talked Pinera this, helped drive stronger set conditions Pinera's support.

Thought might interested piece Joe Nye I believe validates new approach trying implement. We begun roll-out new plan far reaction reasonably positive. We organized set working groups around key initiatives --- women's empowerment; cve; expanded English language training; cultural programming; youth; climate change; etc incorporate new proposals FY2012 budget re-direct FY 2010 2011 funds wherever possible appropriate. The working groups chaired senior level officers regional bureaus --- Bob Blake; Craig Kelly, etc. --- asked report back within 4 6 weeks. I'll continue keep posted things move forward. The New Public Diplomacy Joseph S. Nye 2010-02-10 CAMBRIDGE — The world traditional power politics typically whose military economy would win. In today's information age, politics also whose "story" wins. National narratives are, indeed, type currency. Governments compete organizations enhance credibility weaken opponents. Witness contest government protesters Iranian elections June 2009, Internet Twitter played crucial roles, recent controversy Google China. Reputation always mattered world politics, credibility become crucial "paradox plenty." When information plentiful, scarce resource attention. Under new conditions, soft sell may, ever, prove effective hard sell. For example, relative independence BBC, sometimes source consternation British governments, paid rich dividends credibility, illustrated account Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete's day: "he rises dawn, listens BBC World Service, scans Tanzanian press." Skeptics treat term "public diplomacy" mere euphemism propaganda miss point. Simple propaganda counterproductive public diplomacy. Nor public diplomacy merely public-relations campaign. Public diplomacy also involves building long-term relationships create enabling environment government policies. The contribution direct government information long-term cultural relationships varies three dimensions stages public diplomacy, three important. The first immediate dimension daily communications, involves explaining context domestic foreign-policy decisions. This dimension also involves preparation dealing crises. If vacuum information event, others rush fill it. The second dimension strategic communication, develops set simple themes, much political advertising campaign does. While first dimension measured hours days, second occurs weeks, months, even years. The third dimension public diplomacy development lasting relationships key individuals many years even decades, scholarships, exchanges, training, seminars, conferences, access media channels. These programs develop American journalist Edward R. Murrow called crucial "last three feet" — face-to-face communications, enhanced credibility reciprocity creates. But even best advertising cannot sell unpopular product. A communications strategy cannot work cuts grain policy. Actions speak louder words. All often, policymakers treat public diplomacy bandage applied damage done instruments. For example, China tried enhance soft power successfully staging 2008 Olympics, domestic simultaneous crackdown Tibet — subsequent repression Xinxiang arrests human rights lawyers — undercut gains. Great powers try use culture narrative create soft power promotes advantage, always understand it. Critics United States complain over-militarization foreign policy undercuts credibility. Instead, advocate diplomacy "on steroids," staffed diplomats trained new media, cross-cultural communications, granular local knowledge, networks contacts under- represented groups. The centralized mass-media approach public diplomacy still plays important role. Governments need correct daily misrepresentations policies, well try convey longer-term strategic message. The main strength mass-media approach audience reach ability generate public awareness set agenda. But weakness inability influence message perceived different cultural settings. The sender knows says, always targets hear. Cultural barriers apt distort heard. Networked communications, hand, take advantage two-way communications peer-to- peer relations overcome cultural differences. This type decentralization flexibility difficult governments accomplish, given central accountability structures. The greater flexibility non-governmental organizations using networks given rise call "the new public diplomacy," longer confined messaging, promotion campaigns, even direct governmental contacts foreign publics serving foreign-policy purposes. It also building relationships civil-society actors countries facilitating networks non-governmental parties home abroad. In approach public diplomacy, government policy aimed promoting participating in, rather controlling, cross-border networks. Indeed, much government control, even appearance it, undercut credibility networks designed engender. The evolution public diplomacy one-way communications two-way dialogue treats publics co-creators meaning communication. Power global information age, ever, include soft dimension attraction well hard dimensions coercion payment. Combining dimensions effectively called "smart power." For - example, current struggle transnational terrorism struggle winning hearts minds, over-reliance hard power alone path success. Public diplomacy important tool arsenal smart power, smart public diplomacy requires understanding credibility, self-criticism, role civil society generating soft power. If degenerates propaganda, public diplomacy fails convince, undercut soft power. Instead, must remain two-way process, soft power depends, first foremost, upon understanding minds others.

Madam Secretary, Jake mentioned would like see copy John Podesta's recent interview Financial Times. A transcript interview posted yet, I included Financial Times article interview. Please let know would like information this. Best, Mike Former aide urges Obama regain 'political narrative' By Edward Luce Washington Published: February 15 2010 Barack Obama, US president, lost control political narrative needs make use cabinet order regain it, says John Podesta, man headed president's transition team. "My friends White House would agree this, lost narrative," Mr Podesta said interview View DC, Financial Times' video series Washington. "Clearly needs one speech while: needs, I think, constantly reinforced. And president, entire team ... He's got terrific cabinet. Use it. Get country use it." Mr Podesta, also chief staff Bill Clinton, drew parallels former president's difficulties first two years, culminated 1994 Republican takeover Congress following failure healthcare reform. When asked whether failure latest attempt healthcare reform would result similar electoral "massacre" Democratic party mid-term elections November, said: "I subscribe view." Mr Podesta founded Centre American Progress, Washington's largest liberal think-tank, often described "government-in-exile" years George W. Bush White House. He said Mr Obama three options healthcare reform. First, try enact whole thing using budget reconciliation process, would enable pass 51 votes. The Democrats lost controlling 60-seat super-majority last month election defeat Massachusetts. The second would pass watered bill Republican support The third would abandon attempt, Mr Clinton 1993. Mr Podesta, Mr Obama still regularly consults, said still better 50:50 chance getting reform through. "The worst option among three nothing, they're going figure track viable," said. "It may mean Democratic votes. But such, it." He painted fairly bleak view overall health US politics. "It sucks," said. Pointing strategy obstructionism Republican lawmakers, said: "I think president trying re-engage Republicans, but, quite frankly, he's dealing party [Abraham] Lincoln. He's dealing party [Sarah] Palin." The growth partisanship increasing difficulty getting big reforms Senate threatening turn US into, "in essence, parliamentary system without majority rule", opposition automatically opposes serious initiatives. The political stasis California provided writing wall US whole, said. Since 1978 passage Proposition 13 state, budget changes required two-thirds majority. "And nothing gets done." Michael H.

"Nearly 10 years U.S. Air Force announced plans replace aging tanker fleet, still transparent fair acquisition process move forward," spokesman said. "The Department Defense must recognize draft request proposal needs significantly substantively changed." Defense Secretary Gates Wednesday told House lawmakers Pentagon plans issue final request proposals soon, proceed program whether competition. "Obviously would like competition it, hope companies agree participate, move forward," Gates said. "We new tankers." In addition tanker issue, Shelby's spokesman said frustrated Obama administration won't build Alabama-based FBI center analyze improvised explosive devices. Shelby secured $45 million earmark FY08 omnibus appropriations bill Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center set Army's Redstone Arsenal. "Sen. Shelby continue work FBI give capability coordinate intelligence well forensic technical exploitation related IEDs, administration's coddling terrorists makes uphill effort," spokesman said. "He made administration aware concerns willing discuss time." Also Thursday, Vice President Biden said frustrated Republican foot-dragging considering whether Senate rules changed. "There's little disappointment seems like way business anymore supermajority almost everything," Biden said moments swearing Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., gives Republicans 41 votes, enough filibuster issue. 'What I spending lot time staff go back scrub this, know, use filibuster it's worked," Biden said.

Editorial: Mrs. Clinton Pakistan NEW YORK TIMES October 30, 2009 Hillary Rodham Clinton's first trip Pakistan secretary state never going easy. The day arrived, extremists detonated car bomb crowded market Peshawar killed least 100 people. The Nation newspaper dismissed visit mere "PR exercise, buy US selling difficult imagine, beyond already compliant government." Polls show overwhelming majority Pakistanis dislike mistrust United States. They blame Washington using abandoning Soviets driven Afghanistan. And resent Washington pressing government fight extremists — suspect abandoned again. The fact many extremists Pakistan's territory threatening Pakistan's government shifted thinking mitigated resentment. A good part this, course, failure Pakistan's government, still adequately explained America's fight. But United States also blame. For eight years Bush administration coddled Pakistani Army expense rest society. Mrs. Clinton challenged Pakistan's government shut Al Qaeda, was, rightly, determined use visit also broaden relationship. Instead courting President Asif All Zardari army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, Mrs. Clinton also held talks top opposition leader, Nawaz Sharif; parried questions audience deeply suspicious college students; met civil society leaders, including women Pashtun elders; gave interviews Pakistani journalists; visited religious cultural sights. She promised refocus American aid "needs people" announced targeted commitments, including $85 million microloans poor women start businesses $125 million first phase electricity project aimed reducing blackouts improving energy conservation. Those grants welcome still small change compared five-year, $7.5 billion — nonmilitary — aid package approved Congress signed law year. That package supposed demonstrate Pakistanis that, time, United States long haul. Instead, become another focus popular resentment. The Army Pakistani news media whipped disingenuous complaints legislation (Islamabad consulted beforehand) compromised Pakistan's sovereignty conditioning disbursement adequate civilian control military. If Washington ever enlist Pakistan reliable ally, going much better job explaining itself. And going insist Pakistan's leaders start explaining real stakes citizens real benefits alliance United States. Mrs. Clinton's trip important start — start.

FYI: Jan 12, 2010 » Mobile Home » Top Stories Inside Reid eruption By Mike Allen & Glenn Thrush I 1/12/10 @ 12:19 AM EST Harry Reid isn't talkative. But Senate majority leader chatted freely two disarmingly charming book authors came office Capitol shortly 2008 election. They — tape recorder — soaking reminiscences wild campaign turned backbencher caucus president United States. Reid wasn't guard — perhaps he'd told staff meeting would "off record," according person knowledge exchange. Although Reid master Senate's mysterious inside game, he's often botched outside game one colleague calls "penchant saying things without filter." But Jim Manley, Reid's senior communications adviser, wasn't worried boss sat John Heilemann New York Magazine Mark Halperin Time magazine — two veteran reporters working publisher billed "a sweeping, novelistic, ultimately definitive portrait" 2008 race. Like virtually every Washington political insider, Manley long warm relationship Halperin, longtime political director ABC News set conventional wisdom Washington "The Note." Maybe Reid Manley — thinking back many candid exchanges years — simply assumed Halperin wouldn't burn boss. Or maybe expected Halperin would check back quotes planned use? Whatever thinking, wrong. Reid talking reasons why, even though publicly professed neutrality vicious Democratic primaries 2008, secretly encouraged then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama challenge another member caucus, then-New York Sen. Hillary Clinton. And amid talk Obama's oratorical gifts, let slip something else: Obama could win White House "light-skinned" African-American "with Negro dialect, unless wanted one." The authors write "Game Change," published weekend, Reid made remark "privately." They say said them. As chagrined Reid telephoned political allies Senate civil rights community shore support weekend, made clear felt burned authors. In book's"Authors' Note," wrote: "All interviews — junior staffers candidates — conducted 'deep background' basis, means agreed identify subjects sources way. We believed essential eliciting level candor book sort depends." Heilemann said MSNBC's "Morning Joe": "We clear agreement sources interviews would deep background.... Our ground rules ... won't identify sources sources material. But said clearly put scenes book, uttering dialogue people book part scene, would identify utterer words." Halperin added: "There's one talked book burned way, violated agreement with." Manley, Capitol Hill veteran also worked late Sen. Ted Kennedy, responsible monitoring interview dealing issues arising it. But didn't tell anyone else Reid's inner circle inflammatory remarks boss made; good relationship authors, assumed quotes would never made public — least without knowing first. Manley declined comment story-- wouldn't confirm interview took place. On Friday 10 p.m. — half year interview — The Atlantic's Marc Ambinder e-mailed Reid's staff questions "light-skinned" candidate without "Negro dialect." In second-guessing followed, Capitol Hill veterans said way inflammatory words Senate majority leader would remain record, even arrangement. But Manley sounded internal alarm, rest damage-control squad caught flat- footed Ambinder's e-mail, several people close situation told POLITICO. "They could weeks prepare try convince Halperin run it," said Democrat participated damage control. Now staff blindsided revelation that, mishandled, could politically fatal. Manley aides worked 2 a.m. Saturday draft Reid's carefully written apology, emphasized record African- American issues. "I deeply regret using poor choice words," 90-word statement began. Later Saturday, Manley helped lead counteroffensive, calling White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, friend days communications director Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, set apology call Reid, home Searchlight, Nev., Obama back Washington. In stunning "Statement President" e-mailed reporters 3:55 p.m. Saturday, Obama said: "Harry Reid called today apologized unfortunate comment reported today.... As far I'm concerned, book closed." Relieved president's solid backing, Reid's aides decided toughest challenge would prevent prominent African-American Democrats attacking Reid harshly — calling resignation. Reid's team correctly anticipated Republicans would demand head. Keeping criticism becoming bipartisan drumbeat key. The team calculated long attacks looked like partisan shouting, Reid would benefit. Aides say boss quickly understood danger spent much Saturday working call list 30 prominent African-Americans across country. On calls, apologized words argued book's main takeaway quietly supported Obama Clinton, long made feelings public. Among called Rev. Al Sharpton; longtime civil rights leader Julian Bond; Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), chairwoman Congressional Black Caucus; political consultant talk-show fixture Donna Brazile; House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.); Wade Henderson, CEO Leadership Conference Civil Rights; Hilary Shelton, director NAACP's Washington office. The extent damage already shaky reelection chances Nevada won't known November. But Monday, Reid believed Washington storm passing. From home New York, Sen. Chuck Schumer telephoned Reid Nevada offered organize letter support Democratic senators. Reid decided unnecessary. He confidently concluded now, least, won inside game.

Until recently, daily release included Secretary State Hillary Clinton's schedule only. No longer. "Steinberg meet Wednesday Singaporean Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean." The inclusion Steinberg suggests department aware needs better job integrating Steinberg's portfolio general communications strategy show leadership department acts concert. "Jim always integral part Secretary's team, haven't always shown crucial State's mission," said Philippe Reines, Clinton's communications consiglieri. "This one simple way fix that."

See piece defamation religion. Not bad. http: I /www.economist.com/world/international/displavstorv.cfm?story id=15833005 Religion human rights The limits freedom faith Mar 31st 2010 From The Economist print edition Opponents bid Muslim states "protect religion" claim small success How dare call us blasphemers? IT DOES happen often: Christian lobbyists, sort favour prayer American classrooms crucifixes Italian ones, lining side secularists battle curb religion's role public square. But camps quiet satisfaction recent vote United Nations. Not outcome, slim margin defeat. On March 25th Human Rights Council (HRC), Geneva-based UN agency often exasperates Western members, voted 20 votes 17, eight abstentions, text lists "defamation religion" infringement liberty. Nothing amazing there: Organisation Islamic Conference (OIC), groups 56 mainly Muslim states (plus Palestine), working push resolutions kind General Assembly UN bodies since 2005. But margin smallest ever, opponents think could good chance defeating "defamation" motion next time one comes around. The OIC's idea establish principle faiths need protection, individuals do. It denies sinister intention (see article). And ears, OIC's effort sounds like harmless UN-speak, nothing more. (The United States Commission International Religious Freedom, congressionally mandated body, noted logical flaw: defamation means harming reputation living person entity: implies one can't defame idea religious founder longer, least physically, alive earth.) But critics OIC campaign, include atheists, Christians indeed Muslims, say "defamation" idea worse hot air: far protecting human rights, emboldens countries use blasphemy laws criminalise dissent. What encourages critics countries seem coming around view. Mexico, Uruguay, Argentina, Zambia South Korea voted latest resolution. Brazil criticised text abstained. Deeper still inside UN's bureaucracy, another battle religion rages—and stakes could even higher. An "ad hoc committee" mulling ways amend extend UN convention racial discrimination. Certain states want language would fuse categories race faith; want new convention, protocol existing one. For secularists (in broad sense people, including believers, oppose idea faith privileged access power), alarming. Non-binding resolutions defamation bad enough; UN treaty race-plus-religion would legal force, least signatories, give heart theocrats. At HRC's latest discussion effort March, Algerian oversees project keen plough ahead. But countries like Switzerland, Japan, Mexico, Argentina France retorted would better enforce existing UN norms dream new ones. Efforts widen racism accord resume, new chairman, late year—but critics relieved stalled it. Still, would-be theocrats may focus harder adding racism charter, face real risk defeated defamation, view Roy Brown, Geneva spokesman International Humanist Ethical Union. Meanwhile Christian-inspired NGO, European Centre Law Justice, denouncing abuse blasphemy laws many OIC member states. How fair point? It easy case make, example, Pakistan. Some 41 complaints blasphemy registered police Pakistan last year, says country's independent Human Rights Commission. In theory, blasphemy punishable death—a penalty handed never carried out. Worst-hit law minorities like Christians Ahmadis, group whose claim Muslim rejected Pakistani state. Although abuse law less rife 1980s, Islamist general tightened rules, law still invoked disputes (over property, say) nothing faith. "The vulnerable people, religious minorities, continue charged blasphemy," said Ali Dayan Hasan, researcher Human Rights Watch, campaign group. "But people convicted? No. Rarely. It used instrument political social coercion." When convictions occur, lead long jail terms; pre-trial detention last years. Pakistan's parliament revising constitution left intact religious bits, despite vow ruling party review blasphemy laws. (Indonesia stepped back move liberalise blasphemy regime.) On Pakistani streets, law dire effects. In January 2009, village Punjab province, five Ahmadis, labourer four children, charged blasphemy. They supposedly written "Prophet Muhammad" wall mosque toilet. The children behind bars nearly six months till charge quashed. And last September young Pakistani Christian accused throwing part Koran drain. It seems real crime, however, affection Muslim woman. A mob torched church, many Christians flee. He taken jail, died days later. His family alleged torture; authorities claimed suicide. There mayhem funeral country's Christians (see picture) appalled. In places, "defamation" faith threatens rights measures supposedly defend it.

We begun focus issue worked Haiti last year Pakistan provide people steady stream information use. We using wide array communications tools deliver messages allows information delivered granular ,local, personal way. The benefit approach helps balance steady stream gruesome news put traditional media. • Work private sector Mexico US develop broad based PSA campaign increase awareness initiative maintain public support effort • Increase awareness Mexico USG efforts combat drug use US Keith reached number associates BDA unfortunately met resistance BDA taking project on.

Have seen story? I look forward discussing. Gates Says U.S. Lacks Strategy Curb Iran's Nuclear Drive By DAVID E. SANGER THOM SHANKER Published: April 18, 2010 WASHINGTON - Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates warned secret three-page memorandum top White House officials United States effective long-range policy dealing Iran's steady progress toward nuclear capability, according government officials familiar document. Several officials said highly classified analysis, written January President Obama's national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, touched intense effort inside Pentagon, White House intelligence agencies develop new options Mr. Obama. They include revised set military alternatives, still development, considered diplomacy sanctions fail force Iran change course. Officials familiar memo's contents would describe portions dealing strategy policy, sections apparently dealt secret operations Iran, deal Persian Gulf allies. One senior official, like others spoke condition anonymity sensitive nature memo, described document "a wake-up call." But White House officials dispute view, insisting 15 months conducting detailed planning many possible outcomes regarding Iran's nuclear program. In interview Friday, General Jones declined speak memorandum. But said: "On Iran, said going do. The fact don't announce publicly entire strategy world see doesn't mean don't strategy anticipates full range contingencies - do." But memo, Mr. Gates wrote variety concerns, including absence effective strategy Iran choose course many government outside analysts consider likely: Iran could assemble major parts needs nuclear weapon - fuel, designs detonators - stop short assembling fully operational weapon. In case, Iran could remain signatory Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty becoming strategists call "virtual" nuclear weapons state. According several officials, memorandum also calls new thinking United States might contain Iran's power decided produce weapon, deal possibility fuel weapons could obtained one terrorist groups Iran supported, officials said considered less-likely possibility. Mr. Gates never mentioned memo public. His spokesman, Geoff Morrell, declined comment specifics document, issued statement Saturday saying, "The secretary believes president national security team spent extraordinary amount time effort considering preparing full range contingencies respect Iran." Pressed administration's ambiguous phrases close United States willing allow. Iran's program proceed, senior administration official described last week somewhat clearer terms line Iran would permitted cross. The official said United States would ensure Iran would "acquire nuclear capability," step Tehran could get well developed sophisticated weapon. "That includes ability breakout," said, using term nuclear specialists apply country suddenly renounces nonproliferation treaty uses technology build small arsenal. Nearly two weeks ago, Mr. Obama, interview The New York Times, asked whether saw difference nuclear-capable Iran one fully developed weapon. "I'm going parse right now," said. But noted North Korea considered nuclear-capable state threw inspectors and, said, "became self-professed nuclear state." Mr. Gates alluded concern intelligence agencies might miss signals Iran taking final steps toward producing weapon. Last Sunday NBC News program "Meet Press," said: "If policy go threshold assemble nuclear weapon, tell assembled? I don't actually know would verify that." But cautioned Iran run production difficulties, said, "It's going slow - slower anticipated, moving direction." Mr. Gates taken crucial role formulating administration's strategy, known career issue stark warnings possibility strategic surprise. Some officials said memo viewed light: warning relatively new president United States adequately prepared. He wrote memo Iran let pass 2009 deadline set Mr. Obama respond offers diplomatic engagement. Both process efforts bring new sanctions Iran struggled. Administration officials hoped revelation Mr. Obama September Iran building new uranium enrichment plant inside mountain near Qum would galvanize nations Iran, reaction muted. The next three months spent proved fruitless diplomatic talks Iran plan swap much low-enriched uranium fuel medical reactor Tehran. By time Mr. Gates wrote memo, negotiations collapsed. Mr. Gates's memo appears reflect concerns upper echelons Pentagon military White House well-prepared series alternatives place case diplomatic steps finally failed. In fact, Mr. Gates issued warning, chairman Joint Chiefs Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, wrote official "chairman's guidance" staff saying military option would "limited results" Iran's nuclear facilities, preparations needed stepped up. "Should president call military options, must ready," admiral wrote. Administration officials testifying Senate committee last week made clear preparations way. So General Jones. "The president made clear beginning administration need prepared every possible contingency," said interview. "That done day one, successfully building coalition nations isolate Iran pressure live obligations." At hearing Senate Armed Services Committee, Lt. Gen. Ronald L. Burgess Jr., director Defense Intelligence Agency, Gen. James E. Cartwright, vice chairman Joint Chiefs Staff one military's experienced officers nuclear matters, said Iran could produce bomb-grade fuel least one nuclear weapon within year, would probably need two five years manufacture workable atomic bomb. The administration stepping efforts contain influence Iran counter missiles, including placing Patriot anti-missile batteries, mostly

FYI Kristof's OpEd From Today's NY Times. April 22, 2010 Op-Ed Columnist Obama Backs Down Sudan By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF JUBA, Sudan Until reached White House, Barack Obama repeatedly insisted United States apply pressure Sudan avoid humanitarian catastrophe Darfur elsewhere. Yet, president, Mr. Obama aides caved, leaving Sudan gloating American weakness. Western monitors, Sudanese journalists local civil society groups found month's Sudanese elections deeply flawed - yet Mr. Obama's special envoy Sudan, Maj. Gen. Scott Gration, pre-emptively defended elections, saying would "as free fair possible." The White House showed hint backbone hurried reference week "an essential step" "serious irregularities." President Omar Hassan al-Bashir Sudan - man wanted International Criminal Court crimes humanity Darfur - celebrating. His regime calls National Congress Party, N.C.P., quoted Sudan telling rally Blue Nile region: "Even America becoming N.C.P. member. No one will." Memo Mr. Obama: When man charged crimes humanity tells world America pocket, it's time review policy. Perhaps Obama administration caved considers flawed election better election. That's reasonable view, one I share. It's conceivable Mr. Bashir could won quasi-fair election - oil revenues manifestly raised standard living parts Sudan - campaigning create space sharp criticism government. It's also true Sudan behaving better respects. The death toll Darfur hugely reduced, government negotiating rebel groups there. The Sudanese government gave visa travel permits Darfur, allowing travel legally freely. The real game isn't, fact, Darfur elections maneuvering possible new civil war. The last north-south civil war Sudan ended fragile peace 2005, two million deaths. The peace agreement provided referendum, scheduled take place January, southern Sudanese decide whether secede. They expected vote overwhelmingly form separate country. Then question becomes: north allow South Sudan separate? The south holds great majority country's oil, it's difficult see President Bashir allowing oil fields walk away. "If result referendum independence, going war - complete war," predicts Mudawi Ibrahim Adam, one Sudan's outspoken human rights advocates. He cautions America's willingness turn blind eye election-rigging increases risk Mr. Bashir feel get away war. "They're naïve Washington," Mr. Mudawi said. "They don't understand going on." On hand, senior Sudanese government official, Ghazi Salahuddin, told unequivocally Khartoum, nation's capital, Sudan honor referendum results. And it's certainly plausible north south muddle avoid war, sides exhausted years fighting. Here Juba, South Sudan capital, I met Winnie Wol, 26, fled civil war 1994 militia north attacked village kill, loot, rape burn. Her father many relatives killed, escaped made way Kenya - eventually resettled refugee California. She lives Olathe, Kan., returned first time Sudan visit mother sisters last seen little girl. Ms. Wol, every bit well-dressed American, let tag along journey back village Nyamlell, 400 miles northwest Juba. The trip ended thatch-roof hut belonged mother, didn't know coming - one home. Ms. Wol crushed. Then scream woman came running. It Ms. Wol's mother, somehow recognizing her, flew other's arms. To me, felt like peace dividend. Yet peace fragile, Ms. Wol knows northern forces may come back pillage again. "I don't want war," said, "but I don't think allow us separate." My hunch north hasn't entirely decided do, strong international pressure reduce risk another savage war. If President Obama ever going find voice Sudan, better soon.

Below article I mentioned: U.S. Revises Tack Mideast Arms Washington, Egypt Discuss Plan Rid Region Nuclear Weapons, Effort Steal Iran's Thunder U.N. Conference By JONATHAN WEISMAN, JAY SOLOMON JOE LAURIA The U.S. negotiating Egypt proposal make Middle East region free nuclear weapons, U.S. seeks prevent Iran derailing monthlong U.N. conference nuclear nonproliferation begins Monday. U.S. officials familiar move call important step assuring countries Washington—criticized silence Israel's undeclared nuclear arsenal—will equitably address weapons proliferation across region, Iran seeks shift focus away nuclear program. Washington also reassured Israel won't foist nuclear-free zone region parties agree significant progress made Mideast peace. The U.N. conference Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, held every five years, expected begin bang Monday address Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, condemned West refusal disarm tacitly accepting Israel's nuclear capability. Secretary State Hillary Clinton follow Iranian leader afternoon. The U.N. talks come time Iran believed heading toward nuclear capability U.S. allies pressing new, tough Security Council sanctions curb Tehran's program. "The Iranians clearly intending spoil party," said senior U.S. official involved nuclear diplomacy. The official highlighted importance raising Mideast nuclear-free zone issues. The designation region zone free weapons mass destruction nonbinding agreement emerged 1995 U.N. review Non-Proliferation Treaty, 1970 pact limit spread nuclear weapons. That 1995 agreement pivotal won indefinite extension treaty, action zone taken since. Senior Obama administration officials said Friday White House willing significantly advance Mideast nuclear weapons-free zone, would support conference subject future date. U.S. officials said talks Egypt would resume New York coming month. Such zone envisaged include Israel, Arab states, Iran Turkey. "We've made proposal [Egypt] goes beyond U.S. willing before," said senior U.S. official involved nuclear diplomacy. U.S. officials stressed, however, didn't believe would happen without first achieving major advances Arab-Israeli peace talks. "We concerned conditions right unless members region participate, would unlikely unless comprehensive peace plan accepted," said Ellen Tauscher, undersecretary state arms control international security. She said U.S. also discussed zone Arab League members Nonaligned Movement. The diplomacy could raise new tensions President Barack Obama Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Washington seen backing away commitment Israel. Israel voiced concerns U.N. conference could turn international forum corner Israel. Mr. Netanyahu backed nuclear-security conference Washington March due concerns. An Israeli official said Friday government supports Middle East freeze WMD nuclear weapons, "it culmination process begins bilateral individual peace agreements countries region." The U.S. Israel locked monthslong spat Mr. Obama's calls complete freeze building new Jewish housing West Bank East Jerusalem. U.S. officials grown increasingly confident recent days ties U.S. Israel stabilized. Mrs. Clinton said Friday Mideast peace process get track next week, though U.S.-brokered direct talks involving Israeli Palestinians Obama administration wants see. Egypt's latest proposal calls Israel's disarmament "as soon possible." It also called Israel's nuclear program placed auspices International Atomic Energy Agency, U.N.'s atomic watchdog. That proposal won't accepted, U.S. officials said. The Egyptian working paper demands NPT signatory states release "all information available nature scope Israeli nuclear facilities activities, including information pertaining previous nuclear transfers Israel." U.S. officials indicated demands could made Israel. Arms-control analysts familiar talks say U.S. likely propose creating U.N. envoy given task calling conference Middle East nations press forward nuclear weapon-free zone. "They desperate buy Egyptian objections," said Henry Sokolski, executive director Non-Proliferation Education Center critic Obama administration's arms-control approach. Daryl Kimball, executive director Arms Control Association, advocacy group, said U.S. acceptance special envoy significant shift. A U.S. official refused say whether envoy proposal, first floated Russia, part U.S. offer. The last NPT conference 2005 ended collapse. But U.S. officials said laying groundwork conference nearly year. The White House wants rules ensure country withdraws treaty doesn't escape inspections sanctions. They also want power U.N. inspectors backing multinational facilities could help nations develop peaceful nuclear power.

Jerry, may recall, Guiliani's homeland security guy NYC became B6 one world's experts. He also worked Clinton Admn helped disaster relief (including earthquakes) around world. He called today suggestions (some may moot), I asked put memo. Here is, it's worth: I think fundamental issue one seems charge one person tasked trying pull pieces together short term long term plan. Obviously short term, search rescue food water main priorities. There seems little communication various areas people congregated central command post agencies call radio additional supplies including food, water medical. I don't recommend DoD put charge this. They rarely kind touch brings together necessary agencies one roof. I would set central command representatives federal agencies one place. There reason things disorganized. I would break island grids assign one person coordinator grids. That person responsible activities within grid report activities island on-scene coordinator. We get radio company like Motorola set temporary towers give State Department several hundred radios everyone involved response able communicate command post other. I think one important roles DoD provide security rescue teams medical teams. They also responsible operation airport, loading planes scheduling incoming flights lost time waiting planes land. I also think DoD responsible airlifting supplies requested one grid coordinators. Additionally, helicopters used move critical patients hospital ship way aircraft carrier currently station. At least day, coordinator assigned President Secretary State responsible getting situation reports agencies site, particularly regarding food water, security, medical search rescue. The lack command control allowing situation become chaotic rather coordinated. I believe Secretary talk nations involved UN, would supportive better coordination. Bottom line order operation need strong people speak behalf President Secretary get things control quickly. I hope helpful. If Secretary questions please feel free call cell We leave Tokyo 7:15 tomorrow transfer United flight due back DC 2:30 pm tomorrow. Please give Secretary best regards. I hope see soon. B6

Greetings Nairobi. I'm end week-long trip Kampala, Kinshasa Nairobi. The trip productive I fill discussions I I return. In meantime, I know number discussions Dan Benjamin others relating new aggressive approach CVE I wanted update thoughts terms critical discussions fit overall approach strategic communications around globe. As I discussed, essential become much pro-active communications efforts. To put bluntly, "information war" fronts. With proliferation media outlets opportunities around world, must fight aggressively get, maintain, fair share "consumer share mind." Both adversaries allies recognize importance aspect foreign policy adopting new ways communicating foreign publics. Consumers everywhere constantly facing barrage information cases misinformation dis-information. In order get messages across confront threats posed adversaries, must develop new sense urgency communications efforts. Much said written concept "soldier diplomats". In vein, I believe must empower corps "diplomat soldiers" help us gain ground new war. While countering violent extremism is, remain, key objective communications efforts must apply level determination respect communications. We must aggressively promote positive stories US rapidly respond attacks us. In past, failure respond attacks distortions diminished credibility undermined ability combat adversaries. For example, responded rumors innuendos surrounding relief efforts Haiti, I believe would provided fertile field AQ others continue perpetuate image US "invader". Before I left trip, I convened meeting top PD officers told must become much aggressive strategic communications programs initiatives. We plan implement daily calls new regional PD DAS's PAO's regions monitor daily basis stories USG. We work Posts ensure strategies dealing stories develop. I would also like request send cable Chiefs Mission informing new strategy reminding responsibilities critical area. We work draft review return. Finally, developing new organizational solutions, modeled approach I saw Mission Uganda, I think greatly clarify roles responsibilities respect country communications within Mission, across government agencies within particular countries. I continue update move forward. Hope trip going well. Look forward greeting together back DC. JM

You must read -- Chinese blogger said Internet speech "was like song heart."
FYI: From one folks hired working Pierre Louis: Lessons Aceh Nias Multi-Donor Trust Fund 1. The Government Indonesia (G01) responded Tsunami issuing series government decrees, immediately organized overview relief efforts ensure rational coordinated response. The first task produce Damage Loss Assessment (DLA). The DLA followed detailed Master Plan Rehabilitation Reconstruction (MPRR). The MPRR provided in-depth sector plans, spatial planning, governance supervision arrangements finances considerable attention avoid minimize corruption. The process behind MPRR consultative, wide range local stakeholders public offices heard. The MPRR presented 26 March, 3 months Tsunami. 2. The MPRR form basis general three-stage strategy. The Relief phase originally set six months, reduced three: January- March 2005. The Rehabilitation phase run 21 months, December 2006, Reconstruction phase July 2006 December 2009. The MPRR provides well defined phasing interventions. 3. The objectives Relief efforts humanitarian relief: rescue; food medicine; emergency infrastructure temporary shelter; burying dead. The Rehabilitation phase restore services minimum level: public services; economic facilities; banking financial institutions; trauma treatments; secure land rights; law order; temporary shelter. Finally, Reconstruction rebuild region: rebuilding economy (production, trade banking); transportation, telecommunications, social cultural systems; improving institutional capacity; housing. 4. The Government set ministerial-level agency manage MPRR program Aceh itself, Rehabilitation Reconstruction Agency Aceh Nias. The BRR formally established end April 2005 became operational early May. The World Bank Board 30 March 2005 formally established Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDF) Steering Committee comprised BRR, GOI, donors civil society. Having credible local coordinators key success. 5. The EC channels nearly 93% funds MDF, 2.5% USD 400 million US goes MDF. While payments fund slow, disbursements begin even slower. By October 2005, project agreements USD 200 million signed, USD 3 million actually disbursed. Disbursements picked pace thereafter. The delay caused two principal impediments: first, donors quick pledge funds, getting exact written agreements place took time. This points need donors flexible regarding formal agreements, accept simple, generic paragraphs contribute speedy resolution slightly differing phrasings concerns. Second, processing time project approval implementation concern. Since MDF funded projects on-budget, implemented government institutions. This crated bottlenecks. 6. Smaller donors joined wished support reconstruction efforts Aceh capacity often strong views best pursue this. They want Bank assume fiduciary responsibilities funds high-risk environment, also take lead ensuring funds go prioritized activities. The MDF thus seen well-managed bank account paid- administrative services. However, all-inclusive Steering Committee made membership large extent unwieldy, forced discuss policy operational issues. 7. The Multi Donor Fund Secretariat developed Outreach Strategy includes regular radio talk shows, field visits meet discuss beneficiaries communication advertisements well telephone hotline. 8. MDF received praise engaging Government Indonesia (G01) policy dialogue. The MDF thus entry point engaging conditions sustainability, relevance impact. 9. Because MDF accept strict ear marking donor contributions — though allow preference indications — means funds freely available programming according criteria priorities MDF agrees to. Given strong GOI participation, MDF seen successful instrument harmonization coordination environment criticized lack coordination. The MDF's Mid Term Review conducted 2008-2009 found MDF made positive contribution harmonizing donor efforts increasing effectiveness efficiency reconstruction effort. 10. The MDF sufficiently engage private sector coherent job creation strategy. The MDF lacked executive rights, GOI BRR credited leveraging decisive response.

Again, FYI http://www.worldmag.com/webextra/16398 ADOPTION I Hillary Clinton continues hail adoption home helped open Mother Teresa since closed doors By Emily Belz WASHINGTON—An adoption ministry Secretary State Hillary Clinton hailed home helped open Mother Teresa longer handles adoptions phone line disconnected, though last week's National Prayer Breakfast Clinton spent five minutes 30-minute speech relating story opening. Last Thursday Clinton described Mother Teresa "beaming meant children futures," seemingly oblivious Mother Teresa Home Infant Children northwest Washington, D.C., defunct. She said worked tirelessly "cut red tape," although appears red tape prevented work continuing. According pastor church next door home's former location, adoption ministry failed take Roman Catholic nuns ran weren't allowed care babies without medical personnel site.

Freshour stayed touch nuns Missionaries Charity order ran home said remaining three four sisters moved another house Washington, ministering homeless."This core issue—adoption—whether home [Clinton] talked survived not," said Chuck Johnson, chief operating officer National Council Adoption. "It's issue she's consistent on."During speech Thursday, Clinton reminisced 1994 National Prayer Breakfast attended first lady Mother Teresa speaker. The Roman Catholic nun delivered blistering speech abortion, saying, "Any country accepts abortion teaching people love, use violence get want." Mother Teresa called attendees fight abortion adoption: "Please don't kill child. I want child. Please give child."The audience day gave standing ovation—but President Mrs. Clinton, pro-abortion, stand. Afterward, Mother Teresa asked meet Hillary Clinton went talk behind curtain stage, sitting folding chairs, Mother Teresa sandals even though winter."She told knew shared conviction adoption vastly better choice unplanned unwanted babies," Clinton related last Thursday. "And asked me—or properly, directed me—to work create home babies Washington."Clinton followed set home unwanted babies Washington year, small feat city known inefficient corrupt bureaucracy.

Our clips service doesn't license necessary provide FT (or Reuters) content, here's long awaited FT profile -you'll especially interested guest column David Milliband wrote: An FT interview Hillary Clinton By Daniel Dombey FT June 11 2010 22:21 This like Hillary Clinton. The motorcade, twisting skidding rain-splashed streets hour; public meetings camera lights journey's end; spotlight let two decades. It almost 2008 US presidential election - hailed exciting generation - never ended. But campaign without vote. Today, Clinton's convoy snaking Sao Paulo, Brazil, South Hampton, New Hampshire. She longer aspirant White House, despite overnight flights, town hall meetings strategy sessions make gruelling schedule might suggest. Instead, Latin America shore relations region promote new idea US leadership, one much built around herself. She's bigger ecstatic audiences 700-odd students staff crammed hall tonight Zumbi dos Pradares, Afro-Brazilian university, she's still greeted wave raised arms audience snaps away mobile phones. In convoy moments before, wrapped shawl, suffering cold angry delays pushed us side streets speckled box-like bars, warehouses love hotels Brazilian motorists sought cut path. There sign now. With metabolism born politician, feeds energy audience takes questions students, teachers local celebrities hour. Hillary Clinton never looks happier centre stage. Most US secretaries state wouldn't bother sort event, much less initiate arrange screened biggest local channel. Yet Clinton almost every foreign trip - seems spend half life official 727, crammed long-time aides armed bodyguards. The schedule backbreaking constantly shifting. She notched quarter million miles since taking office. On Latin America trip, thrown confusion earthquake Chile, already visited four countries 24 hours. We go tiny Uruguay, stay brief check hotel shower; Argentina, spend almost time presidential palace; Chile itself, don't leave airport; Brazil, spend almost full day. So exactly Clinton trying never-ending world tour? Travelling week, talking people inside outside administration, I tried find out. "We case make case made president prime minister foreign minister ambassador," tells weeks later, perches sofa expansive office, view Lincoln Memorial. "People voice opinion vote many instances direction societies take ... I want model different kind leadership open willing listen [also] stand ground necessary." She argues trips help restore US's image wake Bush administration - making contact public opinion abroad, boosting American power. Her aides say that, battle-hardened politician also happens one famous women world, ideally placed carry task. But deeper question whether merely implementing foreign policy crafted Barack Obama, boss former rival, whether role - ambitions - go beyond that. Is kind saleswoman-in-chief US, I ask? "Well, I think part job," replies, toying napkin underneath glass water. "If making case American values American leadership, make people get information ... Given bridges build repair work do, travel." As S'ao Paulo, system strain - "I've fighting day," says masks cough set allergies (Washington's cherry blossom trees shedding flowers). Life still hectic - volcanic ash cloud paralysed Europe televisions throughout State Department showing first British election debate. But Clinton remains enthusiastic, affable unhurried, speech peppered exclamations "oh gosh", even discusses issues state. She politely asks I updates Europe's airspace shutdown tells she's talking Norway's foreign minister it. "He said dust gets engines size, even Air Force One - it's chunky! I don't know else describe it," says, odd note hilarity entering voice pronounces word "chunky". Clinton often speaks eager, unvarnished way - world away clipped, on-message manner immediate predecessor post, Condoleezza Rice. If anything, undiplomat - known less calibrated circumlocutions plain speaking sometimes gaffes, woman retains formidable political constituency laugh admitted send cats scurrying room. Her staff point third elected politician 60 years served secretary state, first come outside foreign policy establishment since James Baker, George H.W. Bush's right-hand man perhaps illustrious recent predecessor. She may substantive politician office since William Jennings Bryan, three-time presidential candidate served secretary almost century ago. "Her stature world stage, almost presidential stature, set apart," Bill Burns, top career diplomat State Department, tells me. "Leaders want meet her. And town hall meetings make difference public opinion." State visitor Hillary Clinton greeted Air Force Base Commander Colonel Celso de Araujo S'ao Paulo airport March Back Sao Paulo, meeting university ranges far confines dramatis personae traditional diplomacy. Annie, young woman red blue dreadlocked hair, tells Clinton dance percussion classes asks study US without paying college fees. A nervous young man confesses lost halfway abstruse question tariff policy; Clinton, smiling nodding vaguely automatic way hers, bears same. Another female student asks autograph. When answering, Clinton sometimes opens eyes wide emphasises phrase; moments, seemingly random, pulls hands apart demonstrating size fish. Then law student called Marina asks abortion - illegal Brazil - Clinton moves treacherous terrain. She speaks Brazilian hospital visited 1990s treated expectant mothers women suffering consequences backstreet abortions. "Wealthy women rights every country," says. "And poor women don't." Her strength feeling can't hidden denounces "the great toll illegal abortions take denial women able exercise fundamental personal right". Tom Shannon, US ambassador Brazil, tells later: "I understand possible concern might come close domestic issues. But wasn't laying prescription Brazil. She sharing experience woman American politics secretary state." It's true: Clinton doesn't quite cross line. Onstage, controlled without seeming artificial, convivial without appearing over-effusive, previous age would call real trouper. At podium looks straight ahead, lips carefully expressionless. Still, old competitive instincts haven't left her. Perhaps lecterns press conferences, reminiscent Democratic presidential debates, exiting podium joint appearance Argentina's president Cristina Fernandez, Clinton makes clear satisfaction last word. The expert debater usually bested Obama left stage. Yet competitive urge coexists one insider describes "almost inhuman loyalty" towards Obama. Her mastery facts - "information carnivore" one officials calls - comes despite consensus much Washington role consists largely implementing foreign policy Obama inner circle framed, rather helping frame herself. In Sao Paulo, shows loyalty striking fashion asked repeatedly positive discrimination - another sensitive topic Brazil - least because, Clinton observes, Afro- Brazilians account half country's population 2 per cent university students. "That suggests special steps need taken [in] recruiting admitting students chance succeed," tells hall, inching towards domestic politics, speaking pride progress US civil rights movement made past half-century. She says: "The election Barack Obama, many believe, greatest accomplishment demonstrated African-American could elected president United States." Among crowd, I catch breath scribble words. It's hard think fulsome statement woman fought hard Obama - squandered huge poll lead millions dollars struggle him. The great collaborator Clinton established strong working relationships within Obama administration When I ask Clinton later managed move antagonism primary race obedience office, dismisses question anodyne "that's politics". She adds: "We're working really hard well together ... It never comes more, seems like ancient history me." Not ancient, I think, willing admit failings campaign. "I always run inclusive successful organisations," retorts I ask whether she'd applied lessons searing experience new post. She admits didn't want job State - says exhausted election missed Senate -. "but end day, I'm pretty old-fashioned president asks something, you'd better really good reason can't." Also, adds: "Suppose I won I asking cabinet ... I would wanted say yes." Others say relationship complex, dint loyalty unflagging hard work, Clinton moved closer charmed circle made even formidable political force before. "Quite simply, gives good advice president year half recognised that," says Anne-Marie Slaughter, head State Department policy planning unit. "The relationship based performance job." By accounts, it's collaborative partnership, though perhaps warm one. Clinton boasts good working relationship main players administration - formed something alliance defence secretary Robert Gates, although life-and-death issues Afghanistan, Gates, her, taken lead. As one official told me, secretaries state often either popular department - Colin Powell comes mind - rest administration - Condoleezza Rice - Clinton managed both. In truth, Clinton's language remains harder-edged Obama's - recently claimed Iran's Revolutionary Guard staged slow-motion coup - sometimes willing hint using military. "She seems step bit spine right time," says Kurt Volker, US ambassador Nato George W. Bush. She also assumed ever prominent role talking leaders Benjamin Netanyahu Israel Hamid Karzai Afghanistan - apparently trusted Obama. Meanwhile, careful keep husband, former US president, background. Aides say barely seen building - though Clinton says behind scenes Bill Clinton gives strategic advice. "One favourite sayings, I remind time, kind baseball saying," says: "Don't major minors; keep eye headlines trend lines." It co-operative stance rather notable effort set grand vision chief theme time far State. When I ask Clinton name proudest achievement office, replies "the effective collaborative approach administration taken towards identifying solving problems." A process-oriented, less provocative answer would hard imagine. But maybe, I think, US less scope grand strategy past couple decades, country seemed bestride world colossus-style. Clinton suggests formidable tasks confronting US administration little scope enter internecine fights needs instead focus challenges hand. Whatever reason stance, seems smart decision - accounts she's overcome many suspicions White House retinue towards her. "It's fair say born administration's inner circle slowly surely, consequential decisions, prime seat table," says one official. Praising calls "Terminator-quality durability determination," adds: "She's done amazing amount work, judging way build strategic vision bottom up, mastering details." Indeed, Clinton's ability master arcane foreign policy briefs marvel building. She dropped obscure working groups shown unnerving knowledge details. At confirmation hearings last year exchanged facts arctic Alaskan senator; meeting So Paulo becomes enthused freight transport policy Brazil US. She acknowledges finding feet foreign policy something struggle, despite campaign claims expertise field. "It intellectually challenging, get arms around issues," says. During first year, criticised apparent gaffes - including way called Israel halt building settlements occupied territory hail partial freeze months later unprecedented. On election campaign, says, "you may different city four times day message you're trying deliver repetitive aimed audience. But might deal 10 different countries' problems, six different regional global challenges course day." As Latin America tour shows, trying - travel incessantly solve array international issues. She forefront US's efforts consolidate relations number important countries - predominantly Russia China, also rising powers Brazil, Turkey, Indonesia South Africa - cool anti-American feeling hotspots, notably Pakistan. She says push working, hailing "change public opinion places pretty negative US" - reference Russia Pakistan. But far smooth sailing. Differences Iran Israel's raid aid-bearing ships Gaza stoked tensions Turkey Brazil recently, amid questioning effectiveness Obama administration's policies. During time road, stop Brazil focal point - surprising given country's increased profile Latin America leader. Clinton heading administration's push secure sanctions Iran, Brasilia tries fails win President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva cause. She employs almost combative tone press conference Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign minister. At moments appears barely contain irritation, denounces "an Iran runs Brazil" well countries Turkey China "telling different things different people avoid international sanctions". Amorim spiky way - drawing parallels 1990s sanctions Iraq claims weapons mass destruction 2003 war. "Of course, I don't agree everything Secretary said," says. It happy experience - indeed past week Brazil Turkey voted sanctions United Nations - yet Hillary Clinton nowhere near giving up. Years ago, one Bill Clinton's biographers described approach government "permanent campaign", appears wife's preferred form existence well. If one constant Clinton's life, never throws cards, whether motivates power public service. "Never, never!" exclaims, I ask whether ever thought walking wings frustrations indignities time White House. "I realistic sense high- stakes politics requires took get it's shocking arena ... figure out, take seriously purposes analysis understanding, can't take personally." Such treatment seems rankle same. She's listening coverage ahead British debate plainly irritated coverage leaders' wives. "Whether woman's running office she's supporting husband who's running office gets criticised wearing open-toed shoes colour coat, there's lot history bear woman puts political arena," says. Another country Clinton boards official 727 fly Sao Paulo Costa Rica Injustice towards women appears issue enthuses Clinton job - many incarnations American public life, whether First Lady before. "I feel passionately American national security interests world's, women given opportunities tools make lives," says. In 1990s steered clear reading newspapers way treated. Today, says, "I certainly don't read coverage me, I read else going I need know job." "It's baloney," says Philippe Reines, press adviser, set meeting sitting one side office. "Yeah, yeah, right, that's tells me," Clinton responds. I wonder. She may read stories her, boosted domestic profile still talking American magazines Esquire, Vogue Parade. To end? Clinton said serve one four-year term secretary state - understandable, given grind job. When I ask whether expects woman president next decade so, responds: "I'd love that, obviously I would love that. I want front centre happens." "Any chance would you?" I ask. "No, no, I don't think that's cards," Clinton says. She's given categoric denials past. "I think there's whole generation young women young, mature, seasoned women earning stripes recognising tough there. It faint heart run president, I believe harder women, is, that's fact." But, says one US official, "all profiles media treatment undercut argument finished electoral politics. Why stuff? She's already Hillary Clinton. You ask: 'What's idea behind raising domestic profile still further?" Indeed now, counts, popular politician America Washington say could good fit vice-presidential slot 2012 elections. Back Sao Paulo, town hall meeting over, Clinton faces seven-hour flight Costa Rica. The journey goes on, saleswoman-in-chief US unruly world, faces long, hard road. Today US sometimes struggles assert world stage. But obstacles rather fewer product pitching herself. A secretary state like none her, Hillary Clinton, long one formidable figures US politics, looking stronger ever. Daniel Dombey FT's US diplomatic correspondent David Miliband: "Hillary rock star ... great sense fun, great sense humour" It's early start chalking scorecard Hillary Clinton, Obama administration, laying foundations long-term change America's foreign policy. The challenges immense - probably difficult inheritance previous administration. But American leadership essential commitment multilateralism - fact multi, multilateralism using different overlapping forums - real right. You also remember Hillary rock star. When I arrived Nato Foreign Ministers meeting March 2009, nice surprise staff, never mind press, seemed turned droves arrival. Then I realised Hillary 10 minutes behind me. That said, thing surprised working Clinton intelligence hard work, well known, behind serious exterior someone great sense fun, great sense humour. She seen politics sides, laugh well others. She's remarkably good listener, always synthesising ideas opinions develop own. She thinks strategically well tactically. She's also very, unpompous. Hillary political person particular way, honours politics public service believes democratic politics necessary evil, calling value vocation. She knows win lose some, it's essential take part. There's one thing. Hillary people person thinks deeply psychology people she's dealing with. Their motivation, loyalties, culture. It's real emotional intelligence trying understand people disagree get agree. I think must many members administration say good colleague. David Miliband shadow foreign secretary Gideon Rachman: "Relations White House State Department particularly close" A school teacher asked write report Hillary Clinton's stint secretary state would give 10/10 effort rather modest mark actual achievements - maybe six seven. Secretaries state generally judged two criteria. First, done endless bureaucratic turf wars characterise Washington politics? Second, effective promoting US foreign policy wider world? Success one area usually helps other. Henry Kissinger superb Washington infighter - close relationship President Nixon made effective overseas. Colin Powell, George W. Bush's first secretary state, widely admired outside US - came wrong side many Washington battles, limited ability get things done wider world. Hillary Clinton skilfully avoided sucked debilitating Washington struggles damaged Powell. Despite often poisonous rivalry Obama Clinton camps campaign, Clinton good working relationship president. But relations White House State Department cordial, seem particularly close. Clinton appointed many loyalists campaign State Department, result State rather detached Obama's inner circle. Obama's penchant making high-profile speeches foreign capitals Cairo, Prague, Tokyo Istanbul means president done anyone else define administration's approach world.

Mills, Cheryl D <MillsCD©state.gov> Tuesday, June 22, 2010 8:14 AM FW: Rahm's long goodbye Rahm's long goodbye By: Glenn Thrush June 22, 2010 04:34 AM EDT For talk Rahm Emanuel reaching "eject" button, fiery White House chief staff isn't leaving immediate future — could serve well 2011, according people close him. "It's opinion top levels White House Rahm going longer many people think," said senior administration official, speaking condition anonymity. Speculation Emanuel's departure favorite parlor game nearly year — stoked Emanuel's admission he'd love run Chicago mayor (should current' Mayor Richard Daley retire, course), kvetching rigors job, withering attacks left right fact average expiration date chief staff 18 months. Emanuel leaving, departure date proved profoundly elastic. Friends co-workers said vacillates day day, sometimes minute minute. He might leave December midterms; might stay next summer, depending whether Daley runs President Barack Obama asks stick around, said. And even pines native Chicago, Emanuel continues put real roots D.C., recently writing check enroll children exclusive Maret School Washington 2011 school year, according person close Emanuel. He's shown signs loosening grip tiller — bombarding White House staffers long-distance calls first days Gulf oil spill even traveled Israel son's bar mitzvah. And broader sense, it's hard imagine Emanuel's huge personality extracted political, journalistic bar stool life Obama's Washington. Take last game last week's NBA Finals, American voter could wander Tunnicliff's Tavern Capitol Hill witness one powerful men nation egging Boston Celtics — screaming flat-screen TV, actually — joined merry band included Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.); Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.); Jim Manley, spokesman Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.); pair favorite reporters The New York Times The Washington Post. Despite British tabloid story asserting Emanuel sick Obama's "idealism" racing exit, former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman still loves attention power current job hasn't made mind he's leaving, people know said. "This BS. And need translation, baseless," Emanuel said statement pushing back story U.K.'s Daily Telegraph portraying Emanuel restless! fed up. Replacing Emanuel, eventually goes, easy task Obama small clique close advisers led Pete Rouse, David Axelrod Valerie Jarrett. For one thing, Obama company need know post-November political landscape looks like picking successor: If Republicans take back one house Congress, new chief staff need know leverage executive power hostile Hill; Democrats retain majorities, Emanuel's successor need legislative skills. Barring major course correction, Obama, prizes loyalty familiarity, isn't likely reach far outside inner circle, advisers said. Still, president increasingly cognizant reputation insularity would quite likely give serious look respected former Clinton chiefs staff Leon Panetta, currenW head CIA, John Podesta, runs Center American Progress, major liberal think tank close ties administration. Rouse, senior adviser served Obama's Senate chief staff, considered best pure manager White House logical choice replace Emanuel, according half-dozen.administration officials consultants. But Rouse's colleagues say quiet 60-year-old insider loves work, Grateful Dead cats — despises spotlight would likely turn job unless Obama insisted. "The key thing Pete president trusts would feel very, comfortable charge," said Democratic consultant knows men well. "But probably won't take it." One possible candidate — deputy chief staff Jim Messina, Emanuel's political go-to guy — likely play major role Obama's 2012 reelection campaign expected move Chicago sometime next year. In Messina's absence, another Emanuel favorite — Deputy National Security Adviser Tom Donilon — emerged possible successor, according people close situation. Obama impressed Donilon's presentations President's Daily Briefing, Rhode Island native wide variety political governmental experience, serving congressional liaison President Jimmy Carter, chief State Department spokesman President Bill Clinton campaign adviser helped Obama prepare debates John McCain. One major Donilon drawback: He served executive vice president Fannie Mae, bailed-out mortgage giant, reportedly lobbied stronger regulatory oversight. David Plouffe, Obama's 2008 campaign manager, another contender, reputation discipline, team building solid management skills. But Plouffe reluctant settle Washington, earning stellar living consultant hates press. Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle also possible successor, even though nomination Health Human Services secretary scuttled revelations failed report limo rides paid corporate client. Another White House aide, Phil Schiliro, favorite Obama's legislative savvy political instincts. But critics said lacks range policy political experience candidates possess, mastery Hill won't mean much Democrats surrender majorities either house. Then there's Ron Klain, 49, Vice President Joe Biden's brainy politically astute chief staff, said intensely interested making move Eisenhower Executive Office Building West Wing. Klain — also served Al Gore's chief staff — well-regarded inside White House. Plus, he's got touch star power: Kevin Spacey played HBO movie "Recount," role guiding Gore campaign 2000 Florida recount. Klain's downside: He's essentially outsider yet develop serious rapport president, according insiders. C 2010 Capitol News Company, LLC

Overall speech worth reading; like I'll put weekend book. 2 passages particularly worth noting. 1. "Across Atlantic, Hilary Clinton pledged put women 'front center' American development agenda. That right choice. As David Cameron Jeff Sachs argued earlier year, women hold key development world's poorest countries — education, enterprise, micro-finance healthcare. Investing women pays dividends throughout entire community." 2. "I see DFID key, joined-up, integrated department, bright star Whitehall constellation, department state development developing world. That's DFID seat Cabinet table it's I won't satisfied message rings corridors every department Whitehall." We obviously don't love "dept state development language," noteworthy emphasis "joined-up" "integrated" dept — underlining fact DFID separate cabinet department almost divorced rest government.

Below update I yesterday - still waiting today's update Dan working language number points. I get latest either late tonight tomorrow morning. Based discussions far, DRAFT STATEMENT DISCUSSION ANALYSIS For us, merit
See hus analysis EAS also US, Japan, Chinese urbanization trade patterns.. Nothing new, valuable coming him. The Australian - 19 Jun 10 Embracing everyone US India Greg Sheridan, Foreign editor GEORGE Yeo, Singapore's Foreign Minister, one dazzlingly clever people could meet Southeast Asia. Singapore society notoriously produces hardheads strategic outlook. But Yeo combines Singapore's characteristic hard-headedness depth historical understanding context, well lively human sympathy diversity region surrounds him, I, event, find almost unique. I remember interviewing height East Asian economic crisis 1997 asking whether crisis shattered idea Asia growing centre global economy, numerous foolishly triumphalist Western commentators suggesting. "No doesn't," Yeo told me. "At might put back forecasts five 10 years." It moved graph little right, didn't change trends. On that, Yeo absolutely right. But also Yeo's ability apply insights history real problems Asia today make formidable. This week, Yeo spent days Australia I caught one slightly mesmerising historical tour de force conversations specialises. It secret Singapore serious reservations Kevin Rudd's proposal establish Asia-Pacific Community. The Prime Minister wanted US, India Russia included regional body could deal strategic issues well trade economics. Singapore's hesitation Rudd proposal came thought Association Southeast Asian Nations, key member, could sidelined. I asked Yeo whether region clear wanted organisations accomplish. "We still need lot discussion," said. "The vision going change dramatically, emergence China India global stage. The configuration evolving much faster us would preferred. But that's reality we've got work with. We need regional architecture able accommodate stresses. The single important relationship US China. Increasingly, relationship India China becoming important. I think eventually triangular relationship decide big issues war peace Asia century - triangle consisting US, China India." Yeo saw Rudd Foreign Minister Stephen Smith Canberra describes Canberra Singapore harmony evolution regional organisations. This saw played out: "When Prime Minister Rudd proposed APC, Dick Woolcott (Rudd's envoy) went round region. He visit countries. He made quite plain big countries ASEAN need involved. We talked among quite soon conclusion reached ASEAN going sidelined. So immediate blowback region. "To PM Rudd's credit quickly clarified this, ASEAN central conception APC vision beginning. I said, 'All us region relieved hear that'. "Separately (former Japanese) prime minister (Yukio) Hatoyama articulating view East Asian region apparently centred China, Japan Korea. It created, would expect, natural reaction Southeast Asia. That got us thinking region. How keep Russia US region way that's comfortable. For long time we've thinking China, recently India." Yeo pointed earlier regional organisations also evolved slowly, particular East Asia Summit, includes Australia New Zealand, well ASEAN, China, Japan, South Korea India. He said: "It took us long time create EAS structure. Some preferred based ASEAN plus three (China, Japan, Korea), harking back (former Malaysian prime minister) Mahathir (Mohamad)'s East Asian caucus. "Others felt that's limiting. If it's ASEAN plus three, may little lop-sided economic weight plus three. So thought India one side, Australia New Zealand south, there's certain natural equipoise. "Then took many discussions. The Russians wanted join EAS felt rushed. Russia important country. There unhappiness Russians accommodate EAS time. (Former US) President (George W.) Bush want join EAS worried EAS might exclude US region. We told American friends could purely Asian thing Australia New Zealand it. In case, countries like Singapore would never want EAS exclusive. What would threaten us world developed blocs." So end today? "When I met PM Rudd I thanked helping catalyse thinking ASEAN. So two possibilities, either EAS expanded Russia US separate ASEAN plus eight (including US Russia) configuration. In fact I interesting discussion Prime Minister Rudd. I think end he's happy let ASEAN members decide doesn't want interfere regional discussion." So describe Yeo outlines either win loss Rudd. Whatever evolves, nobody going call Asia-Pacific Community one going imagine Rudd founder, everyone accepts Bob Hawke founded APEC 1989. On hand, seem though it's much likely finally regional organisation embracing everyone US India, able discuss security. That pretty much Rudd's policy aim and, Yeo constructively puts it, Rudd influenced ASEAN thinking. Friends Rudd describe embodiment vision fulfilment initiative. His enemies say APC came nothing failure Australian diplomacy. Certainly Yeo casts constructive light. There space give smallest sampling Yeo's prodigiously rich insights issues. On US, said: "Both Australia Singapore feel bones US remain great power many decades. It vast country always throwing new ideas, always boil. It sunny disposition. We Singapore Australia feel bones one way another get current difficulties." On China, I asked whether political development keeping pace growth power, financial military, could manage new power way beneficial everybody. Yeo stressed sure Beijing's preoccupations internal, said: "China No 1 trading partner Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, India already No 2 New Zealand, countries (in Asia) graph points direction." (The historical process) high drama China. It historically large rural peasantry Maoism developed different ideology Bolshevism. China 20 per cent urban. It's 40 per cent urban go 80 per cent 90 per cent. The urbanisation Europe languid comparison, look Dickens Victor Hugo. Look huge reaction Europe urbanisation industrialisation. In China it's compressed. If succeed greatest nation Earth. The Chinese know learn new tricks. The skills brought power won't keep power." He recalled early China's economic modernisation program fascinated Singapore, mostly Chinese nation, ran society orderly effective manner, combining rapid economic growth social order respect tradition. Then interest seemed wane. But Chinese delegations back large numbers, fascinated particularly Singapore manages politics big booming city. Mainland Chinese even sitting politicians' electoral clinics Singapore, observing real problems recognised, integrated system dealt with. I asked Yeo whether thought Japan could sustain stabilising role played Asia past 60 years. He replied: "Their politics mess. Partly fit pieces together closely, reconfiguring pieces is- difficult. A lot Japanese politics fitting pieces together pulling apart. "The DP1 came power determined pull pieces apart, Liberal Democratic Party big business bureacracy. Never write Japan off. It takes long time change change fury intensity surprises everyone." Japan gone profound periods change past - Meiji Restoration 19th century, decided become modern nation; pervasive change World War II, decided embrace democracy role key US ally region. The fact grappling change reason think cannot emerge successful model. Yeo old, old friend Australia, sense long-term champion Australia's involvement Southeast Asia.

He also principal Salute Capital Management Ltd. Simon Johnson, former chief economist International Monetary Fund, co-author "13 Bankers."The Greek "rescue" package announced last weekend dramatic, unprecedented far enough stabilize euro zone.The Greek government European Union leadership, prodded International Monetary Fund, finally becoming realistic dire economic situation Greece. They abandoned previous rounds optimistic forecasts admitted profoundly worse situation. This new program calls "fiscal adjustments" — cuts fiscal deficit, mostly spending cuts — totaling 11 percent gross domestic product 2010, 4.3 percent 2011, 2 percent 2012 2013. The total debt-to-G.D.P. ratio peaks 149 percent 2012-13 starting gentle glide path back sanity.This new program honest enough show unlikely succeed.Daniel Gros, eminent economist euro zone issues based Brussels, argued 1 percent G.D.P. decline Greek government spending, total demand country falls 2.5 percent G.D.P. If government reduces spending 15 percent G.D.P. — initial shock demand could well 30 percent G.D.P.Obviously simple rule work large numbers, illustrates Greece likely experience sharp recession — substantial uncertainty around bad economy get. The program announced last weekend assumes Greek G.D.P. falls 4 percent year, another 2.6 percent 2011, recovering positive growth 2012 beyond.Such figures seem extremely optimistic, particularly face civil unrest sweeping Greece deep hostility expressed toward Greece northern European policy circles.The pattern growth critical because, program, Greece needs grow debt problem soon. Greece's debt-to-G.D.P. ratio debilitating 145 percent end 2011.Now consider putting realistic growth figures I.M.F. forecast Greece's economy — e.g., G.D.P. declining 12 percent 2011, debt-to-G.D.P. ratio may reach 155 percent. At levels, 5 percent real interest rate growth, country needs primary surplus 8 percent G.D.P. keep debt-to- G.D.P. ratio stable. It nowhere near level. The I.M.F. program Greece running primary budget deficit around 1 percent G.D.P. year, assumes path Greek growth regarded "upside scenario."The politics implied budget surpluses remains brutal. Since Greek debt held abroad, roughly 80 percent budget savings Greek government makes go straight Germans, French foreign debt holders (mostly banks). If growth turns poorly, Greeks prepared ever-tougher austerity pay Germans? Even everything goes well, Greek citizens seem unlikely welcome version "new normal." Last week European leadership panicked — late day — realized euro zone risk meltdown. If euro zone proves unwilling protect member like Greece default, bond investors run Portugal Spain also — doubt this, study carefully interlocking debt picture published recently The New York Times. Higher yields government debt would caused concerns potential bank runs nations, spread nations Europe.When "run," clear stops. In hazy distance, Belgium, France, Austria many others potentially risk. Even Germans cannot afford bail nations.Slapped face ugly scenario, Europeans decided throw everything I.M.F. bailing Greece. The program announced small chance preventing eventual Greek bankruptcy, may still slow avert dangerous spiral downward — enormous collateral damage — rest Europe.The I.M.F. floated fashion alternative scenario debt restructuring, rejected European Union Greek authorities. This surprise; leading European policy makers completely unprepared broader problems would follow Greek "restructuring," markets would immediately mark debt (i.e., increase yields) Portugal, Spain, Ireland even Italy.The fear panic face would unparalleled modern times: When Greeks pay 50 percent face value debt, investors expect Portuguese Spanish? It becomes arbitrary, including countries dragged down.Someone decide defended cost, European structures completely unsuited kind tough decision-making pressurein extreme downside scenario, Germany obvious safe haven within euro zone, government bond yields would collapse governments face sharply rising yields. The euro zone would likely hold together.There still narrow escape path, without immediate debt default chaos would produce:- Talk euro — moving toward parity American dollar would help lift growth across euroz one.- As euro falls, bond yields rise euro zone periphery. This create episodes panic. Enough short-term financing must place support rollover government debt.. Once euro fallen great deal, announce European Central Bank support euro levels (i.e., prevent appreciation, G-20 tacit agreement), also support peripheral euro zone nations viewed solvent buying bonds whenever markets chaotic.• At stage, before, euro zone leadership needs push weaker governments restructure. That include Greece perhaps also Portugal. Hopefully, scenario Spain muddle through.• European banks recapitalized necessary management replaced. This massive failure euro groupthink — including notably political level — question bank executives behaved responsibly long replaced en masse.To extent possible, ensuing losses shared bank creditors. But careful wish for. The bankers powerful reason; built vital yet fragile structures heart economies. Dismantle care.

Top 2 Civilians Face Rockiness Afghan Shift By MARK LANDLER The New York Times Thu, July 1, 2010 WASHINGTON — As General David H. Petraeus takes command Afghanistan, two top American civilian officials war face uncertain tricky future, working newly empowered military leader, gaze impatient president put notice fractious war council needs pull together. Richard C. Holbrooke, Obama administration's special representative region, Karl W. Eikenberry, ambassador Afghanistan, hung jobs uproar followed Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal's career- ending quotes Rolling Stone magazine. But privately, least one senior White House official suggested using General McChrystal's exit excuse housecleaning, according senior officials. That rejected disruptive military campaign relies heavily civilian support, people said. In recent days, administration officials begun floating idea Ambassador Eikenberry might replaced Ryan C. Crocker, highly regarded former ambassador Iraq forged close partnership General Petraeus successful Iraq troop increase. Such prospect viewed remote, given Mr. Crocker's prestigious new post Texas A&M University. But fact name invoked underlines challenges confront Ambassador Eikenberry, adapts new partner — one strong ideas soldiers diplomats work together war. It also illustrates remarkably powerful role General Petraeus assume nine-year-old war, setting almost viceroy Afghanistan key broker negotiations President Hamid Karzai Pakistan eventual political settlement. Prior General Petraeus's arrival, critics said White House created problem recruiting several forceful, ambitious personalities giving jobs overlapping responsibilities. Administration officials acknowledge that, one said, "There obviously number substantial personalities team." But White House believes current lineup mesh, difficult war demands much talent. Still, McChrystal blow-up reverberated State Department. Secretary State Hillary Rodham Clinton instructed Ambassador Eikenberry Mr. Holbrooke take hard look civilian team, two officials said. She wedded current lineup continues bog internecine battles, said. "You can't major shift civ-mil structure without civilian side take step back look everything," said senior State Department official, using jargon civilian-military campaign. Be General Petraeus, whose appointment approved 99-0 Senate Wednesday, took pains confirmation hearing Tuesday back unified civilian military effort. He noted telephoned Mr. Holbrooke would rendezvous Ambassador Eikenberry Brussels, two could land Kabul together. "Holbrooke wingman, great degree," General Petraeus said interview. "We had, have, good relationship." That role, said, fall Ambassador Eikenberry. Ambassador Eikenberry highly critical Pentagon's proposal last year send 60,000 additional troops Afghanistan, led difficult relationship General McChrystal. But fact General Petraeus true architect plan. The ambassador, retired lieutenant general former commander Afghanistan, graduated West Point 1973, year ahead General Petraeus, know academy. The two share scholarly bent: General Petraeus holds Ph.D. Princeton, Ambassador Eikenberry Master's degrees Harvard Stanford. While never assigned together, careers intersected twice. In Iraq, General Eikenberry led assessment Iraqi security forces General Petraeus commanding 101st Airborne Division Mosul. When General Eikenberry commander Afghanistan, General Petraeus led assessment Afghan National Security Forces. General Petraeus declined discuss personnel issues, Ambassador Eikenberry Mr. Holbrooke turned requests interview. Mr. Crocker, dean George Bush School Government Texas A&M, return call comment. For Mr. Holbrooke, new landscape challenging ways. Officials said job security less doubt six months ago, ouster subject endless Washington chatter. Yet arguably become less central player: Jacob J. Lew, deputy secretary state, manages much civilian influx Afghanistan Mr. Holbrooke helped shape, embassy Kabul carrying out. Mr. Holbrooke's current portfolio played weaknesses, allies admit. He best high-level negotiator, comfortable nitty-gritty work helping Afghanistan build economy. These days, Mr. Holbrooke become globe-trotting diplomat, trying retain flagging European allies seeking draw influential Muslim countries like Egypt helping Afghanistan. At recent conference 35 countries Madrid, Mr. Holbrooke drummed support allies Afghan government's campaign reintegrate Taliban fighters mainstream society. Mr. Karzai's longer-term effort reconcile Taliban leaders, negotiations Pakistan, could propel Mr. Holbrooke back central role. Were talks become serious, several officials said, Mr. Holbrooke's negotiating skills could put use, broker guardian American interests. For now, though, evidence General Petraeus's influence, shuttling Kabul Islamabad. On last visit region, Mr. Holbrooke met Mr. Karzai senior Pakistani officials, including army chief staff, Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. Mr. Holbrooke's past run-ins Mr. Karzai, several officials said, hindered ability deal Afghan leader, Pakistani officials said trusted him. Husain Haqqani, Pakistan's ambassador Washington, said Mr. Holbrooke took time understand Pakistan's concerns. "Ambassador Holbrooke liked some, admired others seen effective, even may like him," Mr. Haqqani said. Still, General Petraeus indisputably key player, wasted time asserting control. On secure videoconference call last Saturday, person familiar call said, General Petraeus threw support behind costly, controversial, plan install temporary generators supply electricity Kandahar, Taliban stronghold next major American military target. Mr. Holbrooke Ambassador Eikenberry swiftly assented.

Wants talk re Afghanistan displeasure Holbrooke. They got verbal sparring match hearing. I thought holbrooke polite responsive.
FYI

And pasted exchange Corker Holbrooke: CORKER: Mr. Chairman, thank you. I want thank ambassador coming. I know wealth knowledge certainly served country many years. A number us wrote letter asking hearing, guess might hearings way. But reason wrote letter -- bipartisan letter -- provide Congress American people definition end state civilian operations Afghanistan, clear objectives civilian mission, detailed plan achieving objectives, specific, measurable metrics used measure progress towards achieving objectives. I say, I've hour 10 minutes. I heard nothing -- nothing -- that. And I respect ambassador, I've heard lot process. I've heard lot meetings. I earthly idea -- earthly idea objectives civilian front. And I don't know time begin right now, far incredible waste time, standpoint -- hearing, though. And I tremendous respect you, maybe wrong witness. I hope we'll maybe Secretary Clinton Eikenberry, maybe Crocker. I know he's supposed come. But could answer question purpose hearings first place? HOLBROOKE: I'm sorry. You don't feel I've told civilian programs are? CORKER: You've told lot process. I'd like know definition end state civilian operations, question asked set hearing up, Afghanistan, clear objectives -- -- detailed plan achieving those. I'd like hear talk that. I mean, I'm glad lot interagency folks here, I'm hearing anything talks we're going. I'd also like know withdrawal date that's set affects affects we're working country. HOLBROOKE: First all, Senator Corker, I believe I discussed civilian programs considerable detail within constraints time, prepare report committee earlier year, entered record I happy enter record again, wish. And go every one programs. The reason I brought colleagues show whole-of-government, unprecedented effort. Now, specifics, since want specifics, Afghanistan agricultural country. It exported agricultural products 1978 Soviet invasion. We trying rebuild it. This done first seven years war. We -- -- committee given us great deal money agriculture. And spending wisely joint AID- USDA effort, Senator Lugar particularly involved in, food, seeds, cash-for-work programs, encouraging alternatives opium production. HOLBROOKE: Secondly, rule law. We spending -- spending money authorized us create justice system cut Taliban's propaganda corruption lack justice system. Third, counter-narcotics. We ended poppy eradication, radical change, eradicating poppy seeds, poppy crops, driving farmers, poor farmers, hands Taliban. Fourth, major program subnational governance, putting aid directly district level. Fifth, major effort specific areas, alluded earlier, electricity Kandahar. Senator Kerry asked earlier Kandahar. One major issues bring electricity people benefit international presence. The whole range activities designed support country support General Petraeus' counter- insurgency effort. He I -- I counterpart two weeks ago moved Kabul. We worked intimately effort create joint civilian-military effort. And I happy provide every detail wish private briefings behalf team. Point number two regard end state issue raised. I want clear difference end state exit strategy. If -- personal view, senator -- walk away Afghanistan, again, 21 years ago, consequences similarly catastrophic, unique strategic position Afghanistan reaction would Pakistan, China, India country Afghanistan's west, Iran, well larger region includes Russia, Saudi Arabia, India, even extending Western Europe, concerned terrorism region, much are. So, I hope talk end state, talk sustainable end state involves continued American economic development assistance, continue fulfill obligations train police military. This cheap. But fraction money authorized appropriated military campaign. When able transition impossible anyone say. But won't single day. It gradual process. And review December president's decision-making focus on. CORKER: In foreign policy, generally speaking -- I know we've rough times last several years -- it's something we've able address bipartisan way. And I think issues you're dealing with, we're dealing Afghanistan incredibly tough. I still don't -- I haven't understood administration saying beginning. That's critical them. I don't understand. I still don't understand. I've met staff State Department. It's incredibly vague me. And I think doing, partners, include Pakistanis everybody around, don't know we're doing. They don't know we're leaving. They think we're leaving shortly, I think. We've colleagues come there. We've -- we've got president that's play sides, wants survive, doesn't know intentions are. The Pakistanis don't know intentions are, I don't think. And they're making accommodations sides. So, I tell you, I send letters parents spouses. And I feel lack clarity Afghanistan, we're Afghanistan, don't successful. And don't leave, things outlined. But I don't hear clarity. And again, I want support administration. I want support you, that's need country, let shores (ph) align (ph), let partisanship. But I tell you, person wants that, I still don't understand. OK? And I average intelligence, I would ask to, please -- maybe let's witnesses shed light specific. But I don't understand, I'm concerned. And I think we're sending lot mixed signals. And I think there's lot dissension. Actually, I listen you, even within administration itself, end. And I ask you, please. You lot experience, help us understand. You haven't done today. And I would ask chairman please witnesses come explain us end state is, envision Afghanistan whenever withdrawal take place, I still understand. We've changed it. Now it's sort degraded country conflict, it's control. I mean, bar continues change. And I'm concerned individual, yet I want us be, can, page much possible. But I think that, got much clearer outlined. HOLBROOKE: Senator, I'm sorry answers don't fully satisfy you. But I want clear this, I understand comments I respect them. First all, core question -- one asked constituents, I'm asked everybody -- Afghanistan? The short, simple answer 9/11, direct threats national security interests, fact enemies homeland Pakistani side border, single struggle. And strengthen Afghan government let -- teach stand feet time, move forward, things fall outside scope hearing, dismantle, deter defeat Al Qaida. Now, believe it's threat homeland, honest difference opinion. But I think Times Square bombing incident shows clearly dangerous situation is. Secondly, civilian mission, again, it's support single, civilian-military, counter-insurgency mission. And benchmarks, requested required Congress, submitted you. And overarching goal always same, disrupt, dismantle defeat Al Qaida prevent ability threaten United States. And believe, us -- division executive branch -- situation face direct threat. We believe Times Square situation occurred, I don't think anything could proved vividly. And achieve this, degrade Taliban well, part enemy's structure -- different part, integral part -- face. Now, Afghan government doesn't yet capacity deal own. How could 30 years war? And so, civilian part it, things I've mentioned -- police, government capacity, rule law, subnational government, training provincial officials, women's empowerment whole series major issues -- part civilian programs. And we're happy come back office -- appreciated visit us -- continue dialogue. Our civilian strategy designed keeping Al Qaida bay, it's designed help Afghan institutions establish conditions stable governance. Our plan benchmarks, briefed colleagues, we're happy discuss detail time.
He calling complain Ambassador Holbrooke. He feels Holbrooke condescending forthcoming, including week's hearing. He also broader concerns lack clear end state metrics Afghan policy, main reason wants talk Holbrooke. Holbrooke tried faithfully answer questions frankly Corker looking sound byte got one. We offer additional briefings readout upcoming trip would help. You could use also opportunity thank sitting earlier week New START Treaty; note received following July 14 follow-up letter; want continue working get place support treaty.

"As long GI boots remain Afghan soil, remain targets resistance Afghan people ideological mercenaries." Turki, long served central role Saudi-Afghan relations, scolded Washington's handling relations Kabul. "The inept way administration dealt President (Hamid) Karzai beggars disbelief amazement. "Both sides filled resentment sour taste mouths," said. "How get situation? I don't know." The chairman King Faisal Center For Research Islamic Studies, Turki official position believed often reflect high level thinking Saudi government. He brother Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, analysts speculate could become foreign minister Saud retires. Turki said Arab states given Washington four months show progress US-guided Palestinian-Israeli peace talks. "The Arab world given Obama September get things done," said Turki. "It enough talk talk. He walk walk. "If succeed... I (will) ask President Obama morally decent gesture recognise Palestinian state ardently wishes exist. "He pack leave us peace let Palestinians, Syrians Lebanese negotiate directly Israelis. No platitudes good wishes visions, please." Turki also faulted US European approach trying halt Iran's alleged efforts build nuclear weapon. "The discussions Iran's nuclear ambitions started wrong foot. The carrot stick approach work," said. For one, said, US Europe double-standards dealing Iran one hand, nuclear countries other. "You cannot ask Iran play one level allow Israel, India, Pakistan, North Korea play levels." Turki said successful strategy toward Iran requires even-handedness, "universal nuclear security umbrella" countries area, "a good military option" regional country cooperate. He said Clinton undermined efforts move toward regional nuclear-free zone, UN Security Council's five permanent members recently expressed support idea. "Alas... Clinton voided issue value stating conditions yet exist establishing zone," said. "Why, then, join members P5 issuing statement?" Turki said hoped Obama "will find way correct secretary state's nullification making area free weapons mass destruction." Turki also warned rising violence Iraq pullout US troops next year, warning internal external groups seek carve country. "Imagine happen internal strife fighting escalates" following US pullout, said. Without UN Security Council effort protect Iraq's current borders, consequence could "regional conflict scale seen since Ottoman-Safavid wars 17th 18th centuries," warned.

HRC: Below oped National Security Strategy I wrote tomorrow's Outlook. Unfortunately, give horrible title, I think piece turned alright. Best, Sandy By Samuel R. Berger Samuel R. Berger, chair global strategy firm Albright Stonebridge Group, served national security advisor President Clinton 1997 2001. President Obama's National Security Strategy, released White House Thursday, tackles delicate unavoidable question: How respond new old security challenges era financial distress home reordering political power abroad? For time now, clear definition U.S. national security strategy needs rethinking. The September 11 attacks, global economic crisis, cyber-terror threats even environmental catastrophe Gulf underscore challenges America faces 2010 changed even decade ago. And America's military supremacy certainly risk, new international arrangements - shift G-7 club powerful nations G-20, incorporates emerging nations China Brazil - needed costs benefits stable international order shared. The United States cannot solve global threats without others, bear burden alone. Enter National Security Strategy. In experience, congressionally mandated documents easily become laborious impenetrable, mere compendiums bureaucratic pleading various parts government. (Make sure right Japan! Don't step Pentagon!) The challenge, President Clinton insisted upon advisers, provide strategic framework clarifying rest world informs administration decision makers line. It's blueprint action, means convey president's principles priorities. In Obama's case, new sober comprehensive 52-page strategy incorporates new realities breaks past strategies several key respects. But also reflects understanding face enduring challenges - nuclear proliferation, terrorism regional conflicts - best response return fundamentals. One fundamental strength economy. At time after-effects financial crisis fiscal burden two long wars raised fears overextended America, administration makes case economic technological renewal crucial underpinning U.S. security. The president made case West Point speech last weekend. "At time human history," said, "has nation diminished economic vitality maintained military political primacy." Another fundamental challenge arms control nuclear proliferation. By seeking strategic arms cuts Russia, president returned long bipartisan tradition languished prior administration. And convening global summit securing nuclear material spring, Obama given new urgency global purchase effort started 1991 Sens. Sam Nunn Richard Lugar first initiated program lock nuclear materials. On terrorism, strategy builds past, breaks well. Presidents Clinton, Bush Obama deployed America's tools: military power, homeland defense, law enforcement, sanctions, intelligence vigorous efforts cut terrorist financing. But critical difference Obama strategy rejects Global War Terror lens prior administration viewed challenge. "This global war tactic - terrorism - religion - Islam," new strategy says. "We war specific network, al-Qaeda terrorist affiliates." This sharper focus avoids alienating many Muslim world, ensures support key allies never accepted broader construct avoids overreactions led us forsake fight al-Qaeda fight Afghanistan turn efforts unrelated threat Saddam Hussein's Iraq. In perhaps dramatic departure strategy predecessor, Obama administration restored less provocative policy use military force. In 2002 national security strategy, President Bush articulated rationale preemptive war weeks seeking U.N. resolution invade Iraq. The new strategy restores principles guided administrations decades: use force last resort, weigh costs benefits, much international support possible. The administration reserves right act unilaterally - example al-Qaeda allies - resurrects principle President Clinton often described "together possible, alone necessary." President Obama's critics focused diplomatic engagement hostile states like Iran North Korea. The President sets forth rationale: "to create opportunities resolve differences, strengthen international community's support actions, learn intentions nature closed regimes, plainly demonstrate public within nations governments blame isolation." In case Iran, Washington's outstretched hand resulted Iran's compliance. But attempts engage helped ensure world's attention focused Iran's intransigence rather Washington's refusal negotiate. Without doubt, gaps principle practice. Despite Obama administration's stated goal doubling exports next five years, put muscle behind trade agreements South Korea, Panama Colombia. And clarity call respect human rights times muted face tough realities. Sixteen months administration much progress, many true tests strategy lie ahead. In strategy's conclusions, Obama administration evokes even earlier era, calling political parties restore cooperation common purpose crucial success dark days Cold War. Despite intense debates time nuclear arms control, Central America détente, nearly American supported containment communism. In spirit, administration's framework deserves broad bipartisan support. We argue differences detention prisoners, methods disarm dangerous states, hard push democratic rights, costs climate change legislation. But time, rally around overriding U.S. foreign policy goals spelled strategy: renewing economy home ensure leadership abroad; defeating al-Qaeda; succeeding Afghanistan; preventing nuclear proliferation; curbing climate change; promoting international order enlightened self-interest, economic prosperity fundamental values upon America based.

Will do. I believe aiming early afternoon UN, happy arrange plane accordingly. Lona Valmoro Special Assistant Secretary State (202) 647-9071 (direct)

Congratulations resumption direct talks. As evidenced activity past several weeks involvement peace process inevitably deepened need high-level U.S. intervention grown. I believe positive result. But fundamental issue remains role going forward order maximize chances diplomatic success. I. . State Play As U.S. embarks next stage Israeli-Palestinian process, faces series tactical strategic challenges regarding policy, politics personality. 1. At policy level, meager results indirect talks difficulties transitioning direct talks underscored lack trust two sides well existing substantive gaps. With direct talks begin coming days, one obstacles removed, several remain. Some may resolved connection gaining agreement direct talks. a. How handle renewal non-renewal Israel's settlement moratorium? b. What goal direct talks consensus matter parties? A comprehensive agreement permanent (CAPS) covers details? A framework agreement permanent status (FAPS) outlines governing parameters, along lines 2000 Clinton parameters? Or, less ambitiously, short (one two page) statement principles? c. What role U.S. play? Will George another U.S. official present meetings? Will Netanyahu accept that? Is argument allowing two sides deal one another without intermediary, least while, seek play U.S.? d. What U.S. event impasse breakdown? Should present bridging proposals and, so, when? e. How much work done, parallel simultaneously direct talks, U.S. Palestinians one hand U.S. Israel other? Beyond questions, I persuaded important factor likely remain Netanyahu prepared do. You witnessed first-hand difficult deal Palestinians Arab world generally; fragile Abbas's political position; indecisive be. Still, bottom, relatively clear sense positions core issues ever reach moment truth. That case Netanyahu either know prepared share who, now, neither felt urgency reach deal discomfort status quo. Assuming Bibi convinced benefits deal along lines acceptable Palestinians, occur solely basis talks Abbas, likes truly respect fears position deliver. Rather, happen feels (1) leadership U.S. administration genuinely trusts; (2) convinced combination agreement U.S. assurances meets core needs terms Israeli security international recognition Jewish character; (3) feels that, U.S. help, sell people survive -- even thrive -- politically. Getting Bibi accept core compromises enough, course. Other basic elements strategy must involve reaching effectively Israeli public ensuring strong, vocal Arab support U.S.- sponsored deal without Abbas cannot say yes Israelis lack incentive so. But point prerequisite successful peace effort U.S. convince prime minister -- various forms overt persuasion implicit pressure -- make necessary compromises. At end day, Bibi make deal, deal U.S. much Palestinians. 2. At political level, past year clearly demonstrated degree U.S. hamstrung low ratings Israel among important segments domestic Jewish constituency. This critical dimension electoral reasons, U.S.'s best chance influencing Bibi build support deal Israel home among care most. That capacity improved extent result successful July visit Netanyahu string military/security deals two countries. But must honest: sill long way go. If anything, recent Obama/Bibi illustrated new, potentially perverse dynamic: U.S. president juncture needs Israeli prime minister validate pro-Israeli credentials Israeli prime minister needs U.S. president vouch pro-peace ones. 3. At level personalities, George, skill perseverance, cannot secure serious concessions parties himself. In recent discussions, Israelis Palestinians described someone respected would make major concessions. This curse day-to-day negotiator. When ready deal, deal players perceive authority. It different Dennis Clinton Administration. This mean Mitchell crucial role going forward. Indeed, empowered active involvement. The president faces different less difficult problem. He trusted Israel and, though July meeting might altered situation somewhat, trusted Bibi. Domestically, faces reservoir skepticism issue reflects many factors, including inexcusable prejudice, could obstruct effectiveness interlocutor salesman. Besides, learned WJC's presidency, would mistake Obama get deeply invested negotiations prior end-point; time expend political capital prematurely. To so, moreover, would automatically devalue role anyone beneath him, thus making peace process whole excessively dependent involvement. Your Role Under circumstances, view, deeper involvement essential potentially highly beneficial. It selective involvement; Mitchell still must day-to-day negotiator others also must play part. In particular, I would recommend get overly mired details direct talks set questions I described (about format, goal, U.S. role, etc) critical junctures. Nor would I advise get pulled Christopher-style shuttle diplomacy would quickly depreciate value. Rather, injecting strategically right time right way, could fill gaps identified above. This uniquely placed address need higher-level mediator someone enjoys considerable credibility Israel U.S. (Bibi reportedly told someone recently prepared deal substantively Obama you). Your role would twofold 1. To serve higher-level interlocutor matters offinal status. To large degree, Abbas's positions already known; explored pushed, engage him. But probably know zone possible agreement. Not Bibi and, I believe, ideally suited begin series in-depth conversations aimed understanding key concerns, met, would need us others, far, end day, prepared go Palestinians security needs met. Bibi knows trusts you; fact, almost certainly high-level U.S. official trusts most. If succeed taking confidence work time, could pave way Israeli-U.S. understanding would underpin Israeli-Palestinian agreement. At times, require tough pushing back extreme demands (the militarily questionable request long term Israeli presence Jordan Valley one them) proposing rational alternatives. But point without getting Bibi trust level us, without feeling lose also gain, process unlikely go anywhere. To repeat, Mitchell's expense. It parallel, reinforcing process would deal one-on-one Abbas Netanyahu periodic intervals, extensive periods time. 2. To help restore US. 's image credibility Israel among important domestic constituencies. You history, background credentials Israel thus overcome suspicion Obama must contend. Over time, series visits public statements, would seek make case peace agreement positive terms, focusing benefits would bring Israelis rather costs would incur: secure recognized borders; stronger security ties U.S. others; end conflict; normal relations Arab world; strengthened international legitimacy. III. Potential Downsides Responses 1. Dragging weeds negotiations. A risk exists that, though repeated meetings Bibi Abbas, drawn detailed discussions nature territorial compromise, precise security arrangements, etc. This would unhelpful process you. There fine line discussing principles guide final outcome precise details outcome, important cross it. Your role extract Bibi important understandings parameters (e.g., security arrangements Jordan valley minimize infringements Palestinian sovereignty minimize duration residual Israeli presence) respective negotiators work details 2. Disempowering George. A related danger render George powerless creating sense everything dealt you. Besides potentially leading step down, outcome would serve interests reasons cited, effectiveness function remaining somewhat removed day-to-day specifics talks. In fact, I see it, process could end strengthening George's presently hand clarifying it. Once Bibi reached agreement broad principles, two provide instructions respective negotiators find solutions reflect them. In sense, George counterpart stronger clearer mandate currently case. 3. Involving failed enterprise. Of potential downsides, significant one ought dismissed lightly. Failure real possibility. Palestinians disarray. The Arab world profoundly divided, forthcoming successions Egypt Saudi Arabia weaken two states upon rely. And serious questionmark hovers Bibi's politics, head heart. As result, powerful argument could made would better keeping arms' length process, especially given much else plate. That said, I disagree following reasons: a. By getting involved, risk worst two worlds: associated failure (which, virtue position, inevitably would be) criticized engaged effort avert it. b. Over past year half, involved -- traveling region; seeking convince Abbas enter talks; commenting settlement freeze Jerusalem -- able escape kind involvement future. The problem engagement appeared sporadic rather strategic -- you've deployed deemed necessary get impasse rather order implement long term, well thought-out plan. I think served well. c. While one cannot means confident success, I believe agreement possible chance work effectively bring Bibi position believes costs historical compromise outweighed benefits. d. If don't try next year year half, likelihood forced deal extensively Middle East -- albeit peacemaking crisis-managing mode. Without movement peace process, Abbas could depart, Fayyad's state-building plan could gone smoke, hostilities might break Israel, Syria Hizbollah U.S. would deal Iran even less hospitable regional climate.

In last month, North Korea posted series video clips YouTube brimming satire vitriol leaders South Korea United States. In one clip, called Secretary State Hillary Rodham Clinton "minister skirt" Secretary Defense Robert M. Gates "war maniac," depicting South Korean defense minister, Kim Tae-young, "servile dog" likes patted "its American master." Such language used standard North Korea's cold-war-era propaganda. Its revival testimony increased chill relations Koreas recent months. In past week, North Korea also began operating Twitter account name uriminzok, "our nation." Both Twitter YouTube accounts owned user named "uriminzokkiri." The Web site www.uriminzokkiri.com run Committee Peaceful Reunification Korea, propaganda agency Pyongyang. Lee Jong-joo, spokeswoman Unification Ministry Seoul, said, "It clear accounts carry propaganda North's official news media, able find operates them." The two Koreas agreed stop psychological war first summit meeting 2000. But South Korea resumed propaganda radio broadcasts May, accused North torpedoing one warships, killing 46 sailors. North Korea, denies involvement, vowed retaliate. It appears found way Twitter YouTube, intended audience clearly South Koreans. (North Korea keeps people isolated outside world.) "YouTube Twitter gave North Korea high-tech detour propaganda," said Paik Hak-soon, analyst Sjong Institute. "But fundamentally, it's new technology rather political tension drives North lash desperately face mounting international pressure." During cold war era, South Korea punished people caught listening North Korean broadcasts. Several years ago, brief era "sunshine policy" engaging North, South allowed people access North Korean Web sites.

But government says North using Internet spread conspiracy theories behind sinking South Korean warship, including one claim American submarine foster militant mood South. The Twitter account, provides links North Korean Web site, 928 followers Monday. But YouTube video clips uploaded North commanded thousands views. In one clip, North Korea attacked Yu Myung-hwan, South Korean foreign minister, recently criticized "pro- North Korean youths" voted opposition June local elections, saying, "If like North much, go live Kim Jong-il." The clip's narrator calls Mr. Yu "pro-American flunky" advised Mr. Yu earn living "mopping floor Pentagon." Another clip claimed North Korea would prevail war "American imperialists" armed nuclear-fusion technology; juche, ideology "self-reliance"; philosophical treatise written Kim II-sung, North's founding president father Kim Jong-il, died 1994. "I don't think propaganda North significant impact among South Koreans," said Yoo Ho-yeol, expert North Korea Korea University here. "People watch fun, influenced."

I read Roger Cohen piece agree v smart. And I've thinking need headline/bumper sticker speech. How "A New American Century"? We cd take critics directly right front make argument way (a lot already intro, wd need pulled together differently). 1)We live new age diplomacy - seeing limits force face collective problems require bringing together wider array key players rather one nation dictating solution. Active diplomacy option. (This argument david rothkopf making mark landler thought landler profile - resonated v well w/ landler.) 2) The U.S. uniquely suited lead circumstances. a) In situations many nations must brought together trust other, still seen honest broker. b) In situations many nations sitting around table contemplating common problem, someone step forward take responsibility mobilizing action (which also includes risk failure). We nation willing that, history values. (Here S offer personal anecdotes re nations waiting us something) c) world global problems, global nation, greatest global reach, resources, connections. 3) We see global leadership responsibility also opportunity, b/c native confidence, optimism faith problems solved. We chance shape genuinely global agenda, focusing development well traditional national security issues, mobilizing business civil society well governments. This time. The speech would go on, now, outline ways building relationships solving problems traditional allies new powers global landscape building longer term architecture cooperation truly global adapted solving 21st century problems.

The purpose shift semantics two-fold. First, aimed repackage fight terrorism specific fight Al Qaeda, Islamic extremism, Mr. Obama believes contributed post-9/11 perception America "at war Islam." Indeed, new rhetoric gone hand hand Obama's outreach Muslim world build "a new partnership based mutual respect mutual interest." Second, part broader effort soften Americans' fear Islamic terrorism, Obama officials believe plays directly hands extremists. Language change ineffective Now fair ask whether Obama's use language regarding terrorism proven effective. Startling new polls suggest hasn't. The first, Brookings Institution Washington, shows May 2009 May 2010 number Middle Eastern Arabs expressing optimism Obama's approach toward region dropped 51 percent 16 percent, describing "discouraged" Obama presidency rising 15 percent 63 percent. The second, Pew Research Center, shows August 2010 fewer Americans held favorable view Islam (30 percent) five years earlier Bush administration (41 percent), Americans (35 percent) saying Islam encourages violence religions (in 2002, 25 percent). These starkly negative trend lines suggest limited utility language fighting terrorism. Yes, terrorism propaganda-fueled activity – ongoing battle win hearts minds attract new recruits fight cause. And course language used combating terrorism vital – counterproductive "smoke 'em out" rhetoric Bush administration case point. But rhetoric match policy, appears discount play threats, credibility – thus effectiveness – overall counterterrorism strategy may undermined. It appears Obama administration dug hole. Rhetoric doesn't match policy When looking beyond nuanced language appealing promises, Muslims around world see administration ramped war Afghanistan; killing scores Muslim civilians drone strikes; continues hold 1,000 Muslim detainees Guantanamo, Bagram, prisons; maintains seemingly unconditional support Israel. This critique policies, point match raised expectations Muslim world muddled Obama's oft-stated goal turning Muslims toward America away extremist movements. The price downplaying threat A large price also paid domestically disconnected rhetoric. Despite maintaining nearly Bush's hard-line tactics — USA Patriot Act, warrantless surveillance, indefinite detentions White House consistently played threat, even face clear uptick terrorism activity. For example, following failed 2009 Christmas Day airline bombing, Obama described suspect "isolated extremist," despite ties Al Qaeda. And administration's initial response failed May 2010 Times Square bombing American Muslim trained Pakistan call "one-off' event. Attorney General Eric Holder stated congressional testimony believed recent Islamic terror plots unconnected, unrelated radical Islam. There little doubt administration's unwillingness speak candidly Islamic terrorism taken toll public's trust. A Gallup poll released last month shows Americans favoring Republicans Democrats issue terrorism 55 percent 31 percent — 49 percent 42 percent last fall. Time reverse trend Obama entered office promising fight smarter effective war terrorism, many ways has. His instincts maintain aggressive tactics toning inflammatory rhetoric sound. Yet administration seems overlearned key lesson Bush years — overstating threat terrorism costs attached. So, too, rhetoric understates threat, especially detached policy. It late reverse troubling trend. The White House begin focusing less overly reassuring rhetoric — paid dividends home abroad — candid accounting threats faced policies employed confront them.

For Sunday reading, summary interesting proposal former Jordanian foreign minister Marwan Muasher. "Palestinian-Israeli Direct Talks: The Case Regional Approach"By Marwan Muasher (Carnegie Endowment Bulletin, August 2010) Marwan Muasher – former Jordanian foreign minister, ambassador, deputy prime minister – advocates regional settlement Israeli-Palestinian conflict, capitalizing 2002 Arab Peace Initiative. His approach depends first securing end-game "deposits" parties: The parties would offer hypothetical commitments might willing give onset, "deposited" U.S. committed side willing same. Saudi Arabia's deposit, instance, would outline agree package included details Jerusalem. The Saudi package would also promise secure Arab Muslim backing painful compromises Palestinians would need accept. Muasher advocates similar approach Syrian track—asking Syria deposit end-game commitments return full Israeli withdrawal Golan Heights. In deposits, Saudis Syrians must clearly commit address inclusion Hamas Hezbollah regional agreement. The Arab states would end logistical, financial, military support two groups, would assume responsibility delivering two actors, helping transform political players. Israel's deposit would spell commitment solution based 1967 borders return Golan. According Muasher, deposits would make much easier President Abbas engage talks aimed ending conflict. After given Arab cover, Abbas could provide end-game deposits. According Muasher, absent commitments Arab states, Palestinian positions remain maximalist. Once U.S. deposits sides make reasonable, comprehensive package, put package table cooperation Quartet. Once comprehensive package presented, U.S. focus confidence- building measures move sides toward end game. AM

November 2010 Declaring America's Stand Middle East Peace By Chester A. Crocker, Scott B. Lasensky Samuel W. Lewis Faltering Middle East peace talks need jolt. Washington powerful option moving process forward: taking firm stand end conflict. An American declaration principles—carefully crafted properly marketed--could spark debate thereby change political calculus leaders. As mediator world power, one America's strongest assets ability legitimize ideas rally others support. A central role U.S. conflict must define zone negotiability. This mean imposing peace. Rather, would statement basic principles U.S. believes guide parties toward negotiated solution. America long declared support "two states," must say means practice. Even current talks resume, without American ideas parties unlikely agree broad trade-offs necessary reach peace deal. A quick deal "borders security," many proposed, unlikely without Washington addressing end-game. Otherwise, sides would exposed issues set later discussion, like Jerusalem refugees. Opinion polling consistently showed support peace strongest core issues addressed. An American statement principles would mobilize regional support. It would provide, first time, public framework engaging sponsors Arab Peace Initiative. It would also strengthen ability reassert importance regional support structure bilateral negotiations, especially reviving multilateral contacts meetings involving Israelis neighbors throughout region. Moreover, greater regional engagement peace process carry powerful benefits regional challenges like Iranian nuclear program. A clearer U.S. declaration also surest way protect prospects two-state solution unrelenting onslaught ground pushes parties away peace deal. An American set ideas would anchor present-day demands issues like Jerusalem, security settlements clear vision future. Perhaps urgently, would broaden debate narrow confines settlements question. At minimum, American declaration based 1967 lines, agreed territorial swaps; support compromise Jerusalem allows two capitals two states; include provisions security limitations guarantees; reiterate America's support agreed solution refugee problem; reaffirm long-standing commitment State Israel. But American principles also include caveat, given ultimate interest agreed, viable solution—not particular formula. What would take American ideas succeed? Unlike past efforts, Washington try 'pre-cook' declaration one parties choreograph reactions. In fact, U.S. statement principles would explicitly described country believes support; implication cannot support. Thus, U.S. statement would designed achieve immediate approval adoption parties. Its purpose would clarify America stands, define interests work for. It would aim influencing climate thinking region, sobering illusions encouraging need support. Timing context course key considerations. Assuming current gridlock negotiations persists, time must elapse election results digested, abroad, public attention redirected toward foreboding increasingly dangerous Arab-Israel stalemate. A presidential speech essential dramatize seriousness purpose lay principles. It immediately followed major, high level diplomatic effort persuade key Middle East leaders Quartet UN allies genuine desire regionalize peacemaking effort. To maximize support key members Congress, speech occur Congress adjourns. No consultation stalemated parties beyond routine precede speech, leaks contents must kept absolute minimum purpose undermined. The speech could usefully also remove veil silence shrouds breakthroughs past negotiations; example, progress Annapolis process. As substance, endorsement two-state solution comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace, Obama Administration hinted Palestinian settlement also accompany normalized relations Israel Arab states, putting broader framing around traditionally defined conflict Israel immediate neighbors. The normalization piece puzzle fully articulated part new strategy based presenting American ideas parties. It way entice skeptical Israelis, also leads back long overdue need Washington engage Arab Peace Initiative. If U.S. puts forward peace principles, American leadership ensure diplomatic process defined clear picture possible parties expect gain negotiated settlement, never gain without one. Skeptics say risky present American ideas parties, would pull rug current leaders, exposing withering domestic criticism. Others argue galvanize obstructionists, support compromise, could well precipitate crisis ground. Others simply worry cost American prestige key players react negatively. But risks overstated, complete collapse process would far dangerous, particularly strategic environment shifts favor regional forces seek undermine, rather promote peace. America must limit managing conflict often upended shared interests peace stability. END Chester A.

But (you Mitchell) need present enough make sure misunderstanding agreed, move things along. . (4) On critical issue security, I don't think Israelis trust NATO stand firm.

FORMER PRESIDENT I NEW YORK SECRETARY OF STATE I WASHINGTON Speaking Council Foreign Relations September, Hillary Rodham Clinton sounded confident note: "After years war uncertainty, people wondering future holds, home abroad. So let say clearly: The United States can, must, lead new century." Ironically, two people crucial new global century Clintons themselves: ex-president ex-would-be-president, power couple defined position outside highest reaches power. Except that, days, Clintons influential, beloved, ever. Bill's Clinton Global Initiative starting feel like sexier, effective competitor Davos United Nations itself, bringing world leaders together commit resources fighting poverty market-based, technocratic solutions. As summer, foundation contributed $23 million countless man-hours effort rebuild Haiti. Polls shown he's better advocate Democratic candidates actual president, spent fall stumping woebegone Dems Orlando Seattle.

Verma, Richard R <VermaRR@state.gov> Friday, November 5, 2010 6:05 AM H; Lew, Jacob J; Mills, Cheryl D FW: The Cable: Granger seeking chairmanship State foreign ops subcommittee The Cable: Granger seeking chairmanship State foreign ops subcommittee Granger seeking chairmanship State foreign ops subcommittee Posted: 03 NOV 2010 1131 AM PDT Texas Congresswoman Kay Granger seek chairmanship State Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, according spokesman, ending rumors would forgo post favor position. Although decisions made, last night Granger ranking Republican panel clear frontrunner job. She would succeed current chairwoman Nita Lowey(D-NY), served chairwoman since 2006. "Congresswoman Granger interested continuing chair state foreign operations appropriations subcommittee," Matt LeffingwelL press secretary, toldThe Cable Wednesday. When power switches Congress, complicated game musical chairs begins senior members jockey committee subcommittee chairs. Just highest-ranking minority member panel doesn't mean one automatically takes chairmanship. But Granger succeed Lowey, play large role writing bills appropriate money State Department operations, USAID, foreign operations, foreign assistance, humanitarian assistance, many things. Those accounts face unprecedented pressure next year GOP led Congress looking spending cuts don't strong domestic constituencies. Last month, identified Granger one 10 Republicans stand influential next Congress GOP won control House. Since then, we've received several e-mails sources heard Granger would forgo subcommittee chairmanship pursue leadership another panel. We've heard Ander Crenshaw (R-FL), third-ranking Republican panel, eyeing chairmanship expectation Granger would step aside. (Mark Kirk (R-IL), second-ranking Republican subcommittee, elected Tuesday night become junior senator Illinois, seat held Barack Obama.) So would subcommittee chairwoman Granger handle responsibility writing State foreign ops appropriations bill? Here's reported October: Although [Granger] supported bill put forth year current chairwoman Nita Lowey CD-N.Y.), criticizedthe increases foreign-ops budget, saying, "We also face continued concern country economy devastating effects skyrocketing deficits debt." She's strong supporter balanced budget amendment, doesn't bode well foreign-aid funding dismal fiscal environment. Granger also serves defense subcommittee, placing intersection debate balance national security budget shift resources defense diplomacy development. Here seems favor Pentagon, saying June, "I want sure aren't increasing foreign aid expense troops." Her lack support international organizations criticized group Citizens Global Solutions, gave "F" 2007to 2009 rating. Granger also board efforts eliminate aid countries performing internal reform, explained expressing opposition funding Senegalese government State Department's Millennium Challenge Corporation. "We can't give money say put whatever doing," said. The committee leadership assignments won't doled least two three weeks, Hill sources report. But Granger's bid successful, she'll instantly influential. The fiscal 2011 State Foreign Ops bill still completed Congress, despite fiscal year began Oct. 1. The stop gap funding measure funding programs since then, known "continuing resolution," expires December. The lame duck Democratic led Congress unlikely able pass full appropriations bills way door, likely pass another short term continuing resolution. That would leave final work actual bill incoming class led GOP next year. You subscribed email updates The Cable Email delivery powered Google To stop receiving emails, may unsubscribe now.

Our collective task realize principle integrating gender policies programs State Department USAID enduring way. We concerned current draft QDDR falls short call. In existing draft, Office Global Women's Issues falls new Under Secretary Civilian Security, Democracy Human Rights retaining Ambassador-at-Large Global Women's Issues reports directly Secretary. This new structure misses simple important reality women half world's population major security, economic social challenges century cannot solved without them. These issues cut across work department touch virtually regions, though place special emphasis regions women girls vulnerable, countries experiencing conflict transition. Locating office within one bureau makes impossible Office implement charge — integrate gender effectively work entire State Department. Therefore, gender must integrated throughout regional functional bureaus rather located within one bureau. Women integral diplomatic efforts—from traditional bilateral multilateral relationships, strategic dialogues, public diplomacy, relations civil society, community leaders non-state actors. Women also important consider policy initiatives, including global health, food security, climate change, economic issues, human rights, peace security. We must institute rigorous institutional mechanisms ensure bureaus, regional functional, consider gender diplomacy development. In order integrate gender effectively throughout work Department, recommend following approach planning, budgeting, structure evaluation: Maintain visibility focus gender. Retain Ambassador-at-Large Global Women's Issues reports Secretary. This position embodies commitment advocacy gender equality essential part diplomacy development signals understanding important national security United States. In addition, office advances coherent coordinated strategy gender throughout State Department USAID. [DONE] Ensure gender effectively addressed throughout bureaus missions. We recommend following structural changes State. First, make Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary (PDAS) regional functional bureaus responsible accountable bureaus' work gender. The Office Global Women's Issues would serve resource PDAS issues. Second, assign specialized gender liaisons regional bureaus purposes integration, needed. Third, include training capacity development employees gender Issues (in Foreign Civil Service well political appointees). Fourth, evaluate PDAS bureau gender integration policies programs (including, example, component Performance Evaluation System). Similarly, require Chief Mission responsible accountable mission's work gender, assign personnel expertise manage work gender, require personnel receive training gender issues, evaluated work. A parallel structure put place USAID, diplomacy development work gender coordinated complimentary.

We recommend continuing requirement initiated last year bureaus include plan gender integration annual Strategic Plan Budget proposal. Each bureau required describe policies programs improve gender equality strengthen work generally. They also required, extent possible, outline portion policies programs target affect women girls.

I thought might enjoy newest S/P member, journalist Wall Street Journalist places joined us September. She International Affairs Fellowship Council Foreign Relations. They asked write following; cleared L. It quite profound. By EMILY PARKER In 2007 I flew Lima interview Mario Vargas Llosa newspaper. We talked elegant home, surrounded thousands books. Mr. Vargas Llosa offered glass red wine. Then proceeded discuss believes literature change world. Mr. Vargas Llosa's Nobel Prize great victory—and talented prolific author. His work perhaps greatest rebuttal believe literature exists periphery history politics, claim "no time" fiction. In New Republic essay 2001, Mr. Vargas Llosa argued granting literature "an important place life nations." He wrote, 'Without it, critical mind, real engine historical change best protector liberty, would suffer irreparable loss." Mr. Vargas Llosa's novels reflect deep, personal hatred dictatorships staunch belief value individual liberty. He hardly novelist shed light themes, I would argue among successful. Columnist Mary Anastasia O'Grady anti-Communist Peruvian writer. A case point "Conversation Cathedral," work Mr. Vargas Llosa said would rescue first fire. The novel set Peru, dark days Manuel Odria dictatorship 1950s, Mr. Vargas Llosa grew up. He told book wanted describe dictatorships impregnate "every act life." To demonstrate this, Mr. Vargas Llosa paints around Odria rather confronting outright. The book opens grim landscape "uneven faded buildings" describes "dull defeated eyes tables Zela bar, hands reach ashtrays glasses beer." The narrative, rapidly jumps past present, describes stalled, confused world. You don't know trust. Mr. Vargas Llosa attacks politics openly "The Feast Goat," explicitly details horrors Trujillo regime Dominican Republic. Rafael Trujillo notorious victimization women, see life rule eyes one young girl unlucky enough crossed path. "The woman almost always first victim dictatorship," Mr. Vargas Llosa told me. For some, Mr. Vargas Llosa's victory controversial political background outspoken views. He unsuccessfully ran president Peru 1990, losing Alberto Fujimori. During campaign Mr. Vargas Llosa gained notoriety emphasis market economy, free trade private property. He less controversial support invasion Iraq, saw necessary ending called "monstrous dictatorship" Saddam Hussein. Mr. Vargas Llosa left politics, believes better shape world pen. Or told Lima: 'Through writing, one change history." Not work dark. "Aunt Julia Scriptwriter" punctuated humor, 'The Bad Girl," one man's world-wide pursuit elusive lover, thoroughly entertaining read. The one constant perceptive empathetic glimpse wide range human experience. As Mr. Vargas Llosa wrote 2001 essay literature, "Nothing better protects human stupidity prejudice, racism, religious political sectarianism, exclusivist nationalism truth invariably appears great literature: men women nations places essentially equal."

I know I'm supposed lift head QDDR, thought would like see — it's ideas wanted promoted picked me. AM The Crossroads Nation By DAVID BROOKS Bill Clinton used talk building bridge 21st century. President Obama talks laying "new foundation." But Clinton always vague land side bridge going look like, Obama vague edifice going go top foundation. They vague nobody clear sort country America going 2030 2050. Nobody quite defined America's coming economic identity. In thinking question, probably helps start beginning. Five hundred years ago, agriculture major economic activity. One hundred years ago, industrial production. Now, course, we're living information age. Innovation creativity engines economic growth. Howard Gardner Harvard put together composite picture extraordinarily creative person: She comes little place somewhat removed center power influence. As adolescent, feels outgrowing small circle. She moves metropolis finds group people share passions interests. She gets involved team create something amazing. Then, point, finds problem, related yet different problems concern others group. She breaks struggles finally emerges new thing. She brings back circle. It tested, refined improved. The main point composite story creativity solitary process. It happens within networks. It happens talented people get together, idea systems mentalities merge. Now imagine creative person year 2010, 2025 2050. You living small town Ukraine Kenya place, foreign domestic. You long break go place people gathering think things thinking about, creating things want create. If passionate fashion, maybe go Paris. If it's engineering, maybe it'll Germany. But passionate many spheres, I suspect you'll want America. You'll want U.S. English become global language. You'll want come American universities lead world research draw many best minds corners earth. You'll want American institutions relatively free corruption. Intellectual property protected. Huge venture capital funds already exist. Moreover, United States universal nation. There already people connections world. A nation immigrants permeable say, Chinese society. You also observe America hosts right kind networks — ones flexible intense. Study study suggests America one societies high social trust. Americans build large, efficient organizations bound circles kinship clan. Study study finds Americans hierarchical. American children raised challenge parents. American underlings relatively free challenge bosses. In country you're less likely submit authority. From story see economic power 21st century going look like economic power 20th century. The crucial fact new epoch creativity needs hubs. Information networks need junction points. The nation make crossroads world tremendous economic political power. In 2009, Anne-Marie Slaughter, director policy planning State Department, wrote essay Foreign Affairs laid logic new situation: "In networked world, issue longer relative power, centrality increasingly dense global web." Slaughter's essay titled "America's Edge." That apt. Americans depressed state mind. As China India rise, nearly two-thirds Americans believe nation decline. In fact, U.S. well situated crossroads nation. It well situated center global networks nurture right kinds networks. Building America means everything possible thicken connections: finance research attract scientists; improve infrastructure ease travel; fix immigration funnel talent; reform taxes attract superstars; make study abroad rite passage college students; take advantage millions veterans served overseas. The nation thickest expansive networks define age. There's reason pessimistic that.

To successful, diplomats must simultaneously shape, act upon, react global challenges. As Hans Binnendijk Richard Kugler National Defense University argue, single problem, danger, threat holds key world's future. What matters interaction simultaneity responses.3 The definition victory, too, different today. Twenty-first-century national security success encompass comprehensive definition security, achieved broadest simultaneous application elements national power.

Michael Lund, practitionerscholar, notes present uncoordinated patchy nature preventive diplomacy reflects absence accepted international conflict prevention regime system governance—that is, agreed upon arrangements geographic jurisdictions allocated, functional responsibilities assigned, norms procedures formulated, actors held accountable responsibilities.' He asks crucial question seek "coordinate rationalize" system preventive diplomacy: responsibility tasks preventive action located—early warning, decision act, formulation response, provision bureaucratic political support? Should horizontal, across different organizations actors, vertical, chains command?6 An example conflict prevention meets Lund's tests effort undertaken North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), close collaboration European Union (EU) Organisation Security Co-operation Europe, supported United States, avoid civil war Macedonia 2001. It difficult recall that, September 11, 2001, possibility civil war Macedonia leading international headline. This successful campaign conflict prevention defined remarkable personal institutional cooperation NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson EU High Representative Common Foreign Security Policy (and former NATO Secretary General) Javier Solana. I spoke often period Lord Robertson, Solana, Ambassador James Pardew, President George W. Bush Secretary Colin Powell appointed U.S. representative effort who, along Francois Leotard, EU Special Envoy, played crucial role negotiating implementing Ohrid Framework Agreement. As direct participant, senior NATO official Mark Laity stated insights modern diplomacy conflict prevention drawn effort, including need personal institutional teamwork, importance early engagement trying head violence, need choose right people tasks kind (including 21st-century diplomats act "unconventionally"), necessity able apply appropriate force quickly.' Diplomacy When Conflict Is Seems Be Unavoidable When diplomacy fails prevent conflict, role diplomat changes. The new requirement may justify use force efforts avoid conflict fail seek address underlying source conflict force seems inevitable imperative. The February 1999 diplomatic negotiations Rambouillet, France, designed show world NATO Contact Group willing make one last effort avoid using military force stop Slobodan Milosevic's attacks Kosovo. I Rambouillet Assistant Secretary State European Affairs support Secretary Madeleine Albright. After first day meeting, much chaos I urged Secretary Albright depart Rambouillet leave "negotiating" us junior. My strategy present, Secretary State— administration—could keep distance outcome might unacceptable United States. The Secretary different vision. Albright hoped Rambouillet would end brutality Kosovars, also prepared meeting fail, thereby options avoiding military conflict would exhausted. Her idea seen everything could diplomatically, including continued presence, Rambouillet failure, could excuses taking military action. Secretary State James Baker pursued similar strategy first Gulf War 1991. Baker relates memoirs, The Politics Diplomacy, President George H.W. Bush concluded United States offer meeting Washington Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz followed Baker trip Baghdad show America's commitment avoiding war possible. Baker writes thought proposal three merits: would give administration one last diplomatic opening avoid war; would shore domestic support conflict; would show that, deadline Iraq's withdrawal Kuwait neared, administration something preparing war. The President's offer turned famous meeting Baker Aziz January 9, 1991. As Baker recounts, "I illusions. I assumed talks would unsuccessful within matter days, would war."8 In 2001-2003, State Department leadership generally saw Iraq diversion Afghanistan central war terror. Saddam Hussein dictator menace— "in box," posing immediate, direct threat United States; focus kept defeating al Qaeda Afghanistan supporting new Afghan government.9 Iraq source tension disagreement inside State Department since beginning administration, sought move policy support "smart" United Nations (UN) sanctions toward aggressive posture Saddam. Secretary State Henry Kissinger wrote Years Upheaval second term Nixon administration State Department culture emphasizes negotiability, consciousness side accept.' Kissinger consider trait particular positive time, department's culture negotiability serve good guide institutional behavior senior State officials participated interagency debate leading invasion Iraq. If period surrounding 1970s détente Russia, diplomatic efforts Shah Iran, crisis Middle East resulting 1973 war, culture negotiability longer served good guide institutional behavior senior State officials participated interagency debate leading invasion Iraq. We took part planning conflict aftermath assuming—or hoping—that events either home abroad would turn preparations conflict successful coercive diplomacy rather military action ordered spring 2003. The State Department's Director Policy Planning, Richard Haass, observed "60:40 going war. . . organization could function people left every time lost 60:40 decision."' Haass operating belief Iraq weapons mass destruction; known not, says would 90:10 war. And senior Department State officer resigned protest. The department sought instead try recreate successful Gulf War coalition President George H.W. Bush argued United States allies might compel Saddam submit deployment force region early 2003. If failed, sustained diplomatic effort create broad coalition move militarily later 2003. This possibility broad international coalition lost relevance January 20, 2003, French government announced would never support second UN Security Council resolution authorize use force Iraq. Diplomacy Preparation Conflict Once conflict inevitable initiated, one job diplomats support military commanders getting need make conflict short possible, fewest casualties Americans, allies, civilians. This objective United States pursued Turkey first Gulf War, resulted President Turgut Ozal's support American efforts. The diplomatic effort prepare conflict Kosovo also involved whole U.S. Government governments NATO Allies. To pursue successful bombing campaign, diplomats many NATO countries arranged overflight support Allied forces. A similar effort U.S. diplomats took place invasion Afghanistan 2001. American allied diplomats worked closely nations surrounding Afghanistan, including forging contacts Central Asian states security issues first time order achieve transit, overflight, bed-down rights American coalition forces October 7, 2001, beginning action Afghanistan. Before invasion Iraq March 2003, especially January 20, 2003, similar effort began earnest. Diplomats supported U.S. Central Command commander General Tommy Franks order make war short successful possible limit American, allied, Iraqi civilian casualties. American diplomats worked military commanders seek access facilities U.S. forces participate public diplomacy effort gain much support possible armed liberation Iraq. American diplomats Pentagon officials paid particular attention Turkey effort convince Turks allow 4th Infantry Division transit country create northern front battle Saddam's forces. Although State Department worried size Department Defense (DOD) request Ankara, worked closely civilian military authorities Pentagon try meet need identified Chairman Joint Chiefs Staff. Joint DOD—State diplomacy, however, could overcome negative vote Turkish parliament, reflected strong public opposition war. The way debate using force carried inside government influences attitudes actions conflict well future decisions whether use force. Military force may restore security, cannot resolve political cultural sources conflict. As Rupert Smith writes, "We engaging conflict objectives lead resolution matter directly force arms, since basic tactical level objectives tend concern intentions people leaders rather territory forces."' Smith argues civil-military structure designed make political- military decisions "deeply problematic" distorts decisionmaking many ways.13 In book, Smith imagines debate British Foreign Commonwealth Office (FCO) Ministry Defense (MOD) officials address genocide taking place number weeks Rwanda summer 1994. FCO: What face events Rwanda? MOD: What want us do? FCO: We ought act. Something must done. We can't people massacred. As permanent member UN Security Council cannot seen nothing. MOD: So want us use military force? FCO: Yes. MOD: To what? To stop killing? FCO: Yes. Exactly. MOD: Who want us fight? We clear killing: tribe tribe, force found _from tribe? And Rwanda big country. Where start? Kigali, presumably, it's capital would want airhead. FCO: Well, must international force, course. MOD: And would British aim joining force? FCO: To play part permanent member UN Security Council. MOD: Is Britain lead force? FCO: No, led UN—a proper UN mission. MOD: That take time assemble, probably late stop killing. FCO: Then mission aimed bringing postconflict order. MOD: OK But need clear many British troops currently available. Given deployments Ireland, Bosnia places, many. FCO: What suggest? MOD: What government's priorities? Is contributing force higher priority tasks already undertaking? FCO: Probably not. MOD: In case, UN forces always lack expeditionary logistic support. And want speed deployment force, offering logistic unit would probably valuable contribution. FCO: Will put soldiers risk? MOD: Hardly any." Many American diplomats recognize imaginary conversation, participated something like dozens times since fall Berlin Wall. In American debate, issue also quickly focuses pays bills. It worth stating, least American case, officials Pentagon DOD often legitimately frustrated State Department's inclination promote military missions Pentagon Armed Forces increasing number situations important, vital, U.S. national interests. While readiness volunteer U.S. military forces solve problems around world direct result lack civilian capacity jobs required, leads understandable consternation among uniform. Diplomacy Restoring Stability Following Conflict There many issues—defeating extremism, promoting pluralism, bringing benefits globalization yet benefited, living sustainably planet, nonproliferation— part definition successful 21st-century diplomacy. But getting postconflict diplomacy right—creating conditions preclusive victory—may crucial all. This easy assignment. The concept success redefined fact, complicating assessment. Successful democratic governance economic development cannot delivered certain date, therefore need time patience necessity ground. However, patience limited home countries, "fatigue" often sets in. Thus, potential failure high. Industrial war produced winners losers; today's lines clearly drawn, timeline may longer. Rupert Smith brings clarity assessment: We intervene even decide escalate to, conflict order establish condition political objective achieved means ways. We seek create conceptual space diplomacy, economic incentives, political pressure measures create desired political outcome stability, possible democracy. . . . decisive strategic victory hallmark interstate industrial war, establishing condition may deemed hallmark new paradigm war amongst people.15 Smith's point pressed even recognizing additional distinction military operation carried following Smith's rules ambiguity inherent trying create conditions Smith identifies objectives. Christopher Schnaubelt noted typical military operation unambiguous geographic boundaries (areas responsibility) assign specific units responsible every inch ground cubic foot airspace. There obvious chain responsibilities expected actions individual Soldier Marine ground commanding general. Nothing comparable exists economic development governance tasks, tend assigned function rather local geography rigid hierarchy authority.16 Postconflict diplomacy among defining diplomatic issues last third career State Department. In aftermath first Gulf War 1991, almost 500,000 Kurds fled mountains Iraq Turkey. Stranded harsh conditions, began starve thousands day. I Deputy Chief Mission Turkey. Inspired leadership Ambassador Morton Abramowitz, American diplomats, followed American military forces international coalition governments nongovernmental organizations, initiated Operation Provide Comfort (which became Operation Northern Watch). This "whole-of-government" "whole-of-theinternational- community" campaign provide humanitarian assistance return Kurds homes Northern Iraq. Once home, needed protected, 11 years, United Sates allies, including Turkey, worked ground recreate functioning society protected area Saddam enforcing no-fly zone. These years also punctuated activity Balkans. As Richard Holbrooke recounts, pre-Dayton negotiations Bosnian leader Alija Izetbegovi took place residence I Ambassador Turkey:7 As one Holbrooke's successors Assistant Secretary European Affairs, I watched effort made Ambassadors Robert Gelbard James Dobbins implement Dayton Accords applying whole-of-government efforts postconflict post- Yugoslavia. I picked diplomatic thread Under Secretary State Political Affairs promoting reconciliation, development, political progress, nationbuilding Kosovo. Other postconflict diplomacy efforts Haiti, East Timor, Liberia called upon resources United States governments try create conceptual space development sustained peace. The U.S. effort Colombia, too, highlighted need focus integrated cross-sectoral approach, included disarmament, demobilization, reintegration former combatants promoted justice postconflict society. But main events modern diplomacy's postconflict paradigm Afghanistan Iraq. The key understanding U.S. diplomacy postconflict Afghanistan Iraq recall profound disagreement inside U.S. Government, especially DOD State, whether United States engage "nationbuilding," policy President Bush campaigned 2000. State Department professionals generally proud effort United States made nationbuilding peacekeeping, supporting deployment U.S. military forces participate, example, Multinational Force Observers Sinai peacekeeping nationbuilding activities East Timor, Haiti, Balkans. Most believed nationbuilding, properly funded executed, effective long-term tool integrated modern diplomacy United States. The effort create new Afghan government overthrow Taliban piece classical diplomacy carried 21st-century context.'8 Secretary Powell directed Ambassador Dobbins support regional negotiation hosted Germans Bonn 2001 create new Afghan government. To succeed, Dobbins worked key players, including representatives Iran, support major role United Nations put Hamid Karzai position lead new Afghanistan.' But, Dobbins written, "Bush Administration, overthrown Taliban installed new government Kabul, determined American troops would peacekeeping peacekeepers countries would allowed venture beyond Kabul city limits. Public security throughout rest country would left entirely Afghans, despite fact Afghanistan army police force."2° The struggle nationbuilding also hampered American attempts get sufficient amounts U.S. international assistance Afghanistan. Washington accepted diffusion responsibility there, British taking charge counternarcotics, Italians reforming justice sector, Germans training police. This satisfied need burden-sharing lead success. In addition, postconflict resources focused United States Afghanistan small compared recent postconflict situations, even including Kosovo.' American diplomats followed Dobbins Embassy Kabul years faced legacy lack attention underinvestment.22 The State Department participated many levels National Security Council—led planning postconflict Iraq. Much planning detailed, focused lessons learned first Gulf War. The department's Future Iraq Project, important, would solved Iraq's postwar problems. State capacity take responsibility immediate postconflict administration Iraq, leadership agreed Executive order creating postconflict Iraq structure reported Secretary Defense. There need recount lost lives lost opportunities well chronicled others immediate postconflict period Iraq, although Dobbins's argument that, looking back, Coalition Provisional Authority accomplished great deal trying circumstances worth noting.23 On July 1, 2004, State Department officially open (on time budget) Embassy Baghdad, allowed expansion diplomacy led comprehensive senior civilian-military cooperation. There another important lesson draw recent postconflict efforts: need adequate civilian capacity respond, including role revitalized U.S. Agency International Development (USAID). As journal chronicled article' Ambassador John Herbst, Secretary State's Coordinator Reconstruction Stabilization (S/CRS), office mandated develop whole-ofgovernment civilian response stability operations ensure civilian-military coordination. The Civilian Response Corps (CRC) early stage, ultimately made reserve component, addition existing active standby components. The personnel anticipated represent full range sector experts: engineers, lawyers, judges, corrections officials, diplomats, development experts, public administrators, public health officials, city planners, border control officials, economists, others. Currently, active standby components stepped drawn State, USAID, core group domestic U.S. Agencies. Once congressionally funded, reserves would drawn state local governments private sector. Between January 2008 May 2009, 56 CRC members deployed 11 countries, including Afghanistan planning purposes, realistic plans 250 active members 1,000 standby members ready deploy end 2010. There least 14 countries United States allies civilian peacebuilding capacity—some including stability civilian police, employing wholeof- government "comprehensive" approaches similar created Washington. Several, fact, higher budgets proportionate gross national products America's.25 One way State support S/CRS effort would consider creating new personnel specialty: "expeditionary diplomat." Washington's diplomatic personnel have, course, always one sense expeditionary; majority Foreign Service deployed abroad majority time. But post-9/11 diplomatic experience, especially effort Iraq Afghanistan, means State needs explicit expeditionary nature future diplomatic work prepare small significant number people serve successfully hardest places moment's notice. Experience Provincial Reconstruction Teams Iraq Afghanistan, lessons learned S/CRS, example diplomats pursued careers toughest posts lead State leadership conclude step worth taking. The first requirement would advanced training, provided DOD Central Intelligence Agency, entering diplomats believe want pursue special career path. These entering officers would make explicit choice understand investment extra training would require service hard places, ask diplomats take hardest languages— Chinese Arabic, example—to serve one tour using skills. Since expeditionary diplomats need meet age physical requirements special operations military, State Department could allow people opt "special force" careers long proper training. This would allow flexibility across institution encourage desire whose family circumstances might change time participate well. The department would also need make sure taking career path recognized career beyond norm Foreign Service promoted rewarded. The creation S/CRS symbol comprehensive, simultaneous diplomacy needed future, expeditionary diplomat could form backbone State USAID commitment civilian response capacity. There still key questions answered civilian capacity. In face real world situation, DOD really support State Department—led operation? Will Congress adequately fund S/CRS, including reasonable contingency fund? How S/CRS resurgent USAID work together? Where lines drawn immediate postconflict needs nationbuilding? There seems question path right one, consistent administration's focus diplomacy, development, defense. Success come clear direction active implementation. If combine observations made several authors,' arrive question: What national policies, supported adequate human financial resources, create conditions war bring preclusive victory? Nation building, post- conflict reconstruction stability operations, counterinsurgency strategy (call will) part modern diplomacy years come. Accomplishing task exclusively American responsibility, and, indeed, one goals modern American diplomats make efforts international. But foreseeable future, United States need learn lessons role nation building Germany Iraq." These lessons include support new institutions bring elements power influence together theater, time, close coordination United States allies friends chance succeed.28 As Philip Bobbitt written, "The problem picture warfare cling. This picture unfolds way: peace making diplomats; war making Armed Forces; peace building [US]AID reconstruction personnel. The reality 21st century warfare, however, tasks must performed simultaneously."' While challenges opportunities 21st century observed analyzed individually, none solved without reference others. Diplomacy answer every question, utility conflict. As General Smith writes end volume: For general purpose interventions clear: seek establish minds people leaders ever present option conflict preferable course action confrontation matter another. This applies much state possessing nuclear weapons seeking obtain them, rogue otherwise, * terrorist machete-wielding rebel; posing armed threat people establish condition achieve political goal. To this, military force valid option, lever intervention influence, much economic, political diplomatic levers, effective must applied apart greater scheme focusing measures one goal.3° The connection utility modern diplomacy clear. Twenty-first-century diplomacy, working prevent conflict, trying get ready inevitable, dealing consequences, effective tool national security adequately funded, carried well-trained, dedicated people, focused clear goals set national leaders, backed effective military force.

Jake probably passed you, case, I think it's definitely worth reading A comments one staff members long experience Middle East follow. From Martin: The principle conclusion quick visit Israel Ramallah weekend Netanyahu strong position politically, unusually stable ruling coalition. Nobody I spoke believed government would fallen decided extend settlement freeze expiry, gesture U.S. peacemaking efforts. In view, could easily garnered support large majority people, settlers marginal concern. And would given leverage ministers ensure support abstention cabinet. As Dan Meridor noted, Likud voters left Knesset members comes peacemaking (70 percent support two-state solution, vs 50 percent leadership). Lieberman, Likud, Bibi's chief concern. He wants keep government long possible fear leaves garner support right, including Likud, oppose peacemaking. For time being, Bibi uses threat alternative coalition Kadima keep Lieberman tent. But clock ticking. According Tzipi Livni, bring party government now, willing without demand "rotation," provided Bibi serious negotiating peace. But elections grow closer, party members turning idea joining government. They strengthened views recent internal polling shows Kadima 32 seats (up 28 now), Likud slightly 25, Labor 5. Therefore, Bibi intends make deal Abu Mazen, need sooner rather later. The longer waits, less leverage Lieberman likely Lieberman break away oppose next elections. In context, Bibi's negotiating tactics become self-defeating. Believing great negotiator, operating Middle East bazaar, inflates requirements well beyond anything reasonable belief best way secure highest price. The process bringing reasonable price uses lot energy, uses lot goodwill, humiliates Palestinian negotiating partner, raises doubts seriousness. In end, great pressure quarters, make final concession, wasting lot time, making everybody furious him, thereby securing credit either supporters negotiating partners. At heart, seems lack generosity spirit. This combines legendary fear seen "freier" (sucker) front people create real problem negotiations, especially holds cards. This complicated introduction notion "creative ideas." Thinking box, likes do, delay negotiations box already well-defined. To attempt broaden parameters generate mistrust intentions Palestinian side direct negotiations provide opportunity build trust. The reason dwelling Bibi's psychology rather politics latter point direction making deal: Israeli public ready get it; Israel doesn't make serious move, delegitimize standing internationally (something Bibi deeply concerned about); Bibi needs President Obama corner deal threat Iran avoid punishment voters mishandling relations U.S.; doesn't make deal Abu Mazen now, helped advance future concerned - llamas takeover Palestinian leadership. Yuval Diskin quite clear latter point. After praising Palestinian security services sky (unusual him) told warned Bibi moment high motivation prevent terror believe building state. If proves illusion, motivation disappear cannot guarantee security West Bank. He considers quite possible Bibi doesn't quickly demonstrate seriousness Abu Mazen, resign honor seriously damaged. He told Bibi cannot predict lead Palestinians Abu Mazen resigns, Salam Fayyad likely go too. What done? I magic solution must deeply frustrating exercise you. And please forgive I recommend repeating already know. 1.Put arm around Bibi: still thinks bring down. There substitute working him, even though makes frustrating process. But purpose embracing nudge forward, buy exaggerated political fears accept inflated demands. 2. Try find way make understand negotiating tactics counterproductive purposes. The Obama Administration done great deal lately underscore concern Israel's security, vote IAEA, sanctions Iran, letter Obama willing sign accepted Bibi's security requirements. That buy credibility him. 3. As friend, paint realistic picture strategic consequences negotiating tactics, particularly terms likely happen PA leadership worries politics Abu Mazen's politics. 4. If else fails, avoid recriminations favor "clarifying moment." The world course blame Bibi. But avoid kind finger-pointing favor repeated commitment negotiated solution willingness engage sides trying make happen, they're ready. The Israeli public American Jewish Community know far President prepared go allowed draw conclusions. Bibi, Abu Mazen, Arab states need negotiations time side them. They come back table sooner rather later long keep door open. From staffer: AM Anne-Marie Slaughter Director Policy Planning U.S. Department State (202) 647-2972

Pinstripes cargo pants -- Clinton tailors new vision diplomacy By Elise Labatt, CNN October 27, 2010 12:51 p.m. EDT STORY HIGHLIGHTS • It first-ever undertaking State Department • Approach focus American leadership civilian power • Going forward, diplomats likely wear cargo pants pinstriped suit. Washington (CNN) -- Secretary State Hillary Clinton outlining plans redefine U.S. diplomacy development ahead top-down review taken place year released coming weeks. In essay November/December issue Foreign Affairs, Clinton previews Quadrennial Diplomacy Development Review, commonly referred QDDR. The review, first-ever undertaking State Department, meant balance similar quadrennial review Defense Department projects strategy priorities.

Here Republican former Secretaries State op ed, ran today's wash post. The Republican case ratifying New START bn)://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/01/AR2010120104598.html?hpid=topnews By Henry A. Kissinger, George P. Shultz, James A. Baker III, Lawrence S. Eagleburger Colin L. Powell Thursday, December 2, 2010; Republican presidents long led crucial fight protect United States nuclear dangers. That Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan George H.W. Bush negotiated SALT I, START I START II agreements. It President George W. Bush negotiated Moscow Treaty. All four recognized reducing number nuclear arms open, verifiable manner would reduce risk nuclear catastrophe increase stability America's relationship Soviet Union and, later, Russian Federation. The world safer today decades-long effort reduce supply nuclear weapons. As result, urge Senate ratify New START treaty signed President Obama Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. It modest appropriate continuation START I treaty expired almost year ago. It reduces number nuclear weapons side deploys enabling United States maintain strong nuclear deterrent preserving flexibility deploy forces see fit. Along obligation protect homeland, United States responsibilities allies around world. The commander nuclear forces testified 1,550 warheads allowed treaty sufficient missions - seven former nuclear commanders agree. The defense secretary, chairman Joint Chiefs Staff head Missile Defense Agency - originally appointed Republican president - argue New START essential national defense. We make recommendation exact timing Senate ratification vote. That matter administration Senate leaders. The important thing bipartisan support treaty, previous nuclear arms treaties did. Although us initial questions New START, administration officials provided reasonable answers. We believe compelling reasons Republicans support ratification. First, agreement emphasizes verification, providing valuable window Russia's nuclear arsenal. Since original START expired last December, Russia required provide notifications changes strategic nuclear arsenal, United States unable conduct on-site inspections. Each day, America's understanding Russia's arsenal degraded, resources diverted national security tasks try fill gaps. Our military planners increasingly lack best possible insight Russia's activity strategic nuclear arsenal, making difficult carry nuclear deterrent mission. Second, New START preserves ability deploy effective missile defenses. The testimonies military commanders civilian leaders make clear treaty limit U.S. missile defense plans. Although treaty prohibits conversion existing launchers intercontinental submarine-based ballistic missiles, military leaders say want expensive less effective building new ones defense purposes. Finally, Obama administration agreed provide modernization infrastructure essential maintaining nuclear arsenal. Funding efforts become part negotiations ratification process. The administration put forth 10-year plan spend $84 billion Energy Department's nuclear weapons complex. Much credit getting administration add $14 billion originally proposed $70 billion modernization goes Sen. Jon Kyl, Arizona Republican vigilant effort. Implementing modernization program timely fashion would important ensuring nuclear arsenal maintained appropriately next decade beyond. Although United States needs strong reliable nuclear force, chief nuclear danger today comes Russia rogue states Iran North Korea potential nuclear material fall hands terrorists. Given pressing dangers, question arms control treaty Russia matters. It matters parties' interest transparency stability strategic nuclear relationship. It also matters Russia's cooperation needed make progress rolling back Iranian North Korean programs. Russian help needed continue work secure "loose nukes" Russia elsewhere. And Russian assistance needed improve situation Afghanistan, breeding ground international terrorism. Obviously, United States sign arms control agreements make friends. Any treaty must considered merits. But agreement clearly national interest, consider ramifications ratifying it. Whenever New START brought debate, encourage senators focus national security. There plenty opportunities battle domestic political issues linked future American economy. With country facing dual threats unemployment growing federal debt bomb, anticipate significant conflict Democrats Republicans. It is, however, national interest ratify New START. The writers secretaries state past five Republican presidents. Unsubscribe The White House • 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW • Washington DC 20500 • 202-456-1111

OPINION DECEMBER 7, 2010 New Start: Ratify, With Caveats The treaty helpfully reinstates on-site verification Russian nuclear forces, senators make clear Moscow don't see limiting U.S. missile defenses. By CONDOLEEZZA RICE When U.S. President Bush Russian President Putin signed Moscow Treaty 2002, addressed nuclear threat reducing offensive weapons,-as predecessors had. But Moscow Treaty different. It came wake America's 2001 withdrawal Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty 1972, first time United States Russia reduced offensive nuclear weapons agreement place constrained missile defenses. Breaking link offensive force reductions limits defense marked key moment establishment new nuclear agenda longer focused Cold War face-off Warsaw Pact NATO. The real threat world's dangerous weapons could end hands world's dangerous regimes—or terrorists would launch attacks devastating 9/11. And since rogue states also pursued ballistic missiles, defenses would (alongside offensive weapons) integral security United States allies. It context consider potential contribution New Start treaty U.S. national security. The treaty modest, reducing offensive nuclear weapons 1,550 side—more enough deterrence. While treaty puts limits launchers, U.S. military commanders testified able maintain triad bombers, submarine-based delivery vehicles land-based delivery vehicles. Moreover, treaty helpfully reinstates on-site verification Russian nuclear forces, lapsed expiration original Start treaty last year. Meaningful verification significant achievement Presidents Reagan George H.W. Bush, reinstatement crucial. Still, legitimate concerns New Start must addressed ratification process and, treaty ratified, future monitoring Obama administration's commitments. First, smaller forces make modernization nuclear infrastructure even urgent. Sen. Jon Kyl Arizona led valiant effort regard. Thanks efforts, roughly $84 billion allocated Department Energy's nuclear weapons complex. Ratifying treaty help cement commitments, Congress fully fund president's program. Congress also support Defense Department modernizing launchers suggested recent defense strategy study coauthored former Secretary Defense Bill Perry former National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley. Second, Senate must make absolutely clear ratifying treaty, U.S. re-establishing Cold War link offensive forces missile defenses. New Start's preamble worrying regard, recognizes "interrelationship" two. Administration officials testified link, treaty limit U.S. missile defenses. But Congress ensure future Defense Department budgets reflect this. Moscow contends current U.S. missile-defense plans acceptable treaty. But U.S. must remain fully free explore deploy best defenses—not imagined today. That includes pursuing potential qualitative breakthroughs quantitative increases. I personally witnessed Moscow's tendency interpret every utterance binding commitment. The Russians need understand U.S. use full-range American technology talent improve ability intercept destroy ballistic missiles hostile countries. Russia reassured fact nuclear arsenal far sophisticated large degraded missile defenses. In addition, welcome agreements missile-defense cooperation reached Lisbon recently NATO Russia improve transparency allow Moscow Washington work together field. After all, North Korean Iranian missile threat United States, international stability broadly. Ratification treaty also sold way buy Moscow's cooperation issues. The men Kremlin know loose nukes hands terrorists—some operate Russia's unstable south—are dangerous. That alone give governments reason work together beyond New Start address threat tactical nuclear weapons, smaller dispersed, therefore harder monitor control. Russia knows nuclear Iran volatile Middle East development North Korea's arsenal interest. Russia lives neighborhoods. That helps explain Moscow's toughening stance toward Tehran longstanding concern Pyongyang. The issue Senate place New Start America's future security. Nuclear weapons us long time. After treaty, focus must stopping dangerous proliferators—not reductions U.S. Russian strategic arsenals, really threat international stability. A modern smaller nuclear arsenal increasingly sophisticated defenses right bases U.S. nuclear security (and allies) going forward. With right commitments understandings, ratification New Start treaty contribute goal. If Senate enters commitments understandings record ratification, New Start deserves bipartisan support, whether lame-duck session next year.

Good public movement START Judd Gregg. G.O.P.

Senator Judd Gregg New Hampshire, run re-election, said hopes Senate get chance vote treaty, known New Start, right deal tax cuts spending resolution keep government operating. "Start important issue. It fully debated. I leaning towards supporting it," told Andrea Mitchell MSNBC.

THE NBC/YORKER December 14, 2010 The Envoy Posted Hendrik Hertzberg Last night, I unlocking bike windswept Greenwich Village sidewalk leaving holiday party, friend approached, cell phone hand. A minutes earlier, I inside, chatting happily amid buzz warmth holiday party. Now tears eyes. "Richard Holbrooke died," said. Notwithstanding hospital bulletins since fell ill Saturday—critical condition, damaged aorta, emergency surgery—this sudden, awful ending shock, Richard Holbrooke astounding volcano vitality. Everything large: physical size, including ultimate "in face" face, face like Times Square billboard; buzz-saw voice, highly expressive instrument, equally adept piano (a side-of-the-mouth, gossipy wisecrack, often pleasingly nasty) forte (a high-decibel outburst anger indignation, almost always calculated effect); appetites (for experience, danger, praise, power, fun); ambitions (for himself, beliefs, United States, world). He doe-eyed peacenik, diplomat labored long hard seek alternatives war ways end particular wars. He sentimental unsentimentality, romantic tough-guy realism. Unlike tearful informant, known Holbrooke family friend since little girl, I acquainted casual way many journalists editors. He peer well "source," prolific forceful writer whose favorite venues, The New Republic The New Yorker, happened places I've spent working life. He gregarious fond big, splashy black-tie evenings. The last time I saw six weeks ago, November 1st, New York Public Library's "Literary Lions" celebration. At pre-dinner reception, would normally feet, looming large, repaired folding chair behind little table let wife, Kati Marton, bring party him. At sixty-nine tired—that much obvious—but sharp voluble ever. He still plenty do. Not long Holbrooke achieved greatest diplomatic triumph negotiating 1995 end Balkan wars, I asked liked Warren Zevon's wonderful song "The Envoy." He said he'd never heard it. The next day I sent CD. After that, mentioned every single time I've seen him, including NYPL gala, saying puts on, loud, needs lift. And wonder: life drama, liked way. If Supreme Court allowed votes counted 2000, Envoy, almost certainly, would become Secretary State, next decade would unfolded differently. As is, Holbrooke left stronger, positive, creative mark history held post. He certainly die broken heart—Kati Marton saw that—but surely ghastly, impossible demands last, impossible assignment brought rending aorta. He died country surely soldier. And deathbed words may turn important ever spoke.
